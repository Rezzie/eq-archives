There is a nasty bug going around, that will lock your character out of the game and require the Server GMs to roll your character back to a previous save, in order to fix you.

If you have your familiar buff up, but no familiar, you will become bugged if you die after going linkdead.

To be safe, avoid using your familiar, or live with his flapping until the next patch.

..and you thought you'd finally been rid of that darned saying, huh?  Well, I'm just writing to say hello to you all and to give a huge thank you to Merloc, Glinlor, Rombus, and Samadhi for keeping things rolling while I've been away.  If you guys only knew how much I appreciate you and everything you do.
<p>
When I moved to my new home, I lost my DSL and was forced down to dial-up.  That wouldn't have been so bad but the phone lines where I live are plagued with static, causing horrendous lag spikes and disconnects from EQ.  I heard of people saying that I eBAY'd, took the money and bought a Jaguar with the profits.  As much as a new S-Type or XJR would be fun to pitch sideways in some turns, I don't think it's going to happen.  Graffe is Graffe.  No eBAY and no Jag.
<p>
I miss EQ and I miss EQ a lot.  Be it the gameplay, the friends, or the ability to just blow stuff up, I miss it.  Most of all, I miss not having the personal time to devote to you all and this website.  Thank you all for understanding my situation and I hope to be able to put some time into this site, as well as the game, soon.</p>

  <p><b>* Alternative Advancement Abilities *</b></p>

  fixed <br>
  </b><br>
  <b>* Spell Changes *</b></p>

  - Egress and Abscond have a reduced mana cost and a lesser chance to fizzle
  <br>
  <b>- Translocate spells no longer require that the target be grouped with the 
  caster. Also, the dialog box for this spell will remain longer<br>
  </b>- Levitation spells now check to see if you have a second Levitation type 
  spell when it wears off before hurling you to the ground <br>
  - Eye of Tallon has a longer duration<br>
  - Spell memorization speed should now take +Meditate% skill items into account</p>
  <p><b>* Zone Changes *</b></p>
  <p>- Changed safe spot in Kedge Keep to actually be a safe spot </p>
  <p><b>* Combat *</b></p>
  <p>- Pets are now more likely to avoid NPC ripostes <br>
  <b>- Wizards now have an inherent chance to score a critical blast with their 
  damage spells after 11th level. This ability does not lessen the chance of 
  scoring a critical hit with Alternate Experience abilities that grant 
  criticals <br>
&nbsp;</b></p>
  <p><b>* Miscellaneous Changes *</b></p>
  <p>- Critical hit messages from spells now take into account PvP damage 
  calculations. The actual damage was calculated correctly, it was just 
  displaying wrong on the critical message </p>

<p>It appears that some new changes for Wizards have made it onto the test 
server.&nbsp; Rich Waters was kind enough to share them with us on the forums...</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Hi all, just wanted to mention a change I put up on Test tonight and get 
  some feedback -<br>
  <br>
  Now on Test Server - Wizard's have had a new Evacuate spell added, and the 
  existing one has been lowered in mana cost.<br>
  <br>
  Lesser Evacuate costs 150 mana and is available at level 12. It drains 300 
  mana from the party when it is cast, and takes 12 seconds to cast.<br>
  <br>
  Evacuate now costs 100 mana to cast and only drains 150 mana from the party. 
  This is changed from 300 mana casting cost, and a 750 mana drain on the party.<br>
  <br>
  The goal of this change is to allow lower level groups to have a good escape 
  option when adventuring into dungeons. It should also have the benefit of 
  adding value to taking an evac caster in your group at earlier levels.<br>
  <br>
  I'll check back later for feedback, so please post if you have an opinion and 
  get some time.<br>
  <br>
  Thanks,<br>
  <br>

<p>Please keep in mind that these changes are of course only on test and that they may never make it to the live 
servers.</p>

<p>Caster Balance!!!!</p>
Is it possible our time has finally came? Read on my wizardly brethren.</p>
<p><b>Caster Balance</b></p>
<p><b>It's been clear for awhile now that priests and casters haven't been as
well balanced as we'd all like them to be. Balance is a delicate issue and any
major changes to overall class power are always researched, debated, and taken
slowly. There are some really big improvements in the works now for helping out
with that balance, and we expect those to be on the Test server in the near
future. These changes won't all come in one huge patch, but will show up a bit
at a time until casting classes are right where they should be in relative
power.</b>
<p><b>We are taking the needs and issues of casters seriously, and we think
you'll be very happy with the results you see after we finish our caster balance
effort. We hope you'll be patient just a bit longer, while we take the time to
get everything implemented, balanced, and tested.</b>
<p><b><br>
Ancient Spells</b>
<p><b>One specific area we are addressing for casting classes revolves around
how much improvement they get from raiding and acquiring high-level items. When
a melee class begins to acquire items from the hardest monsters, they experience
a tremendous growth in power. A melee character sporting Vulak weapons and
Temple of Veeshan loot is incredibly more powerful than player who only owns
average quality items. Casting classes don't achieve nearly the same amount of
increased power from raid items, and rapidly fall behind melees in relative
power when they start raiding. It doesn't make sense for a wizard who has helped
in slaying hundreds of dragons to be using the same spells as someone who has
yet to take part in raid encounters.</b>
<p><b>To address this problem, we've introduced the new &quot;Ancient&quot;
category of spells recently. Ancient spells are rare, high-quality spells that
can only be obtained from the most powerful monsters. These spells are improved
versions of spells already available to each casting class. They won't give
casters any brand-new, or out-of-class abilities, but are intended to make the
casters better at what they already do. Much like a warrior improves himself by
getting a better sword from a dragon, a wizard can now acquire more efficient
spells in the same way.</b>
<p><b>As you might expect, Ancient spells are going to be rare and take a
certain amount of effort to obtain. We don't expect many casters to ever get all
the Ancient spells for their class. This is a change from the traditional
approach we've had to spells, which has allowed every caster to feel entitled to
get every one of their spells. We'll continue to make core spells available to
casting classes off of vendors, or as relatively frequent drops off of monsters,
but we want to be clear that Ancient spells are rare and powerful items of
treasure, and we intend them to be very hard to get.</b>
<p><b>Only the first set of Ancient spells have been added to the game. In the
coming weeks, we'll continue to add more Ancient spells to the game and expand
the selection for casters and priests. It takes some time to get the spells
balanced, tested, and placed on monsters - so expect to see them coming in a few
sets at a time.</b>
<p><b>One last thing to note about Ancient spells- the power of these spells
will vary depending on what monster drops them. You can expect Vulak A'err to
have more powerful Ancient spells than you might find on Trakanon, for instance.</b>

Last week I was in a conversation with Lawrence Poe (if you don't know by now, he's been our spell guru at Verant for quite some time.. picking up where Geoff Zatkin left off) when he slams me with the statement that he's not working on EverQuest anymore.  'Oof' was the first thing that came to my mind.  So I asked him if he was going to go flip burgers for a living.  It turns out that he will still be working for Verant on an unannounced project doing gameplay systems and mechanics. He seems to be really happy and excited. (before the e-mails start: yes, I asked him about the unannounced project and he didn't share any info.)
<p>
Why am I writing all of this?  Well, in my eyes, Lawrence Poe did a phenomenal job of filling in where Geoff Zatkin left off.  He had his own ideas on what wizards should be and he used the playerbase’s ideas and knowledge to the fullest.  He watched, listened, implemented, and tweaked our class into something we should all be thankful for.
<p>
So to wrap this up, thank you Lawrence.  Thank you for taking notice to a class that was lacking and having the cahones to do something about it.  I’m sure there are still the few blind wizards that will chastise you but know that the mass majority of us thank you from the bottom of our mana reserves.  Good luck on your new adventure in game development!</p>

<p>Lawrence Poe took the time to comment on some caster aspects of the game at 
the Dallas Fan Faire.&nbsp; Here are a few Wizard-related issues he spoke about.&nbsp; 
If you wish to read the entire transcript you can check it out over at
<a target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com">CastersRealm</a>.</p>
<font size="2">
<blockquote>
  <address>
    <span style="font-style: normal">Q. Recently there was a major revamp to 
    melee classes, is anything in line to casters?<br>
    <b>A. We have been taking a look at that. I can't say anything on it since 
    nothing is set in stone yet, but we have been talking about it a bit.</b></span></address>
  <p>Q. What do the familiars do?<br>
  <b>A. The lower level ones add resists and see invis etc.&nbsp; As you get the 
  higher level ones they will add to your mana pool, give more resistances, 
  decrease your fizzle rates, things like that.&nbsp; The familiar problem with them 
  poofing when you invis yourself, that was meant to be fixed before release&nbsp; 
  But eventually you will be able to invis yourself and lose your familiar.&nbsp; It 
  is on the list.&nbsp; No ETA at this time.&nbsp; With familiars also if they die you do 
  lose your mana, but they aren't meant to do it if they just poof from 
  invisibility or something.&nbsp; So I'll look into that.</b></p>
  <p>Q. What happened to the Wizard anchor spells?<br>
  <b>A. They never really made it out of the concept stage.&nbsp; They won't be going 
  in as far as I know at the moment.</b></p>
  <p>Q. Is there any cap on Flowing Thought?<br>
  <b>A. Yes, you can never get more than 15 points of Flowing Thought active at 
  a time.</b></p>
  <p>Q. Why don't the Wizard Luclin gates work off Luclin?<br>
  <b>A. It was designed by the team that it would be that way.&nbsp; All I can really 
  say.</b></p>
  <p>Q. Any chance we will get the drop rates for Kunark spells increased?<br>
  <b>A. There's something of a phenomenon here because all the class spell drops 
  are the same percentage.&nbsp; I read a lot of class forums and things, and really, 
  Shamans just seem to be really unlucky.&nbsp; I'm serious, all the spell drops are 
  on a very even percentage chance they can drop.&nbsp; I do concede though that 
  maybe they could be looked at across the board.&nbsp; It isn't a Shaman specific 
  thing though.</b></p>
  <p>Q. Can we get the grouping requirement for Translocates taken off now we 
  have the confirmation box?<br>
  <b>A. It's something that's being talked about.&nbsp; It may not happen but it is 
  being discussed.</b></p>
  <p>Q. Will we ever see normal invisibility not have a random duration?<br>
  <b>A. I don't think so.&nbsp; That was a design decision from some time ago in the 
  life of EverQuest and I really don't foresee it changing.</b></p>
  <p>Q. Any chance of ever having a mana bar shown to your group?<br>
  <b>A. That's a design decision and not one I can make on my own.&nbsp; But I think 
  you should be able to see other people in the groups mana.&nbsp; If you can 
  recognize their physical condition you should be able to recognize their 
  mental condition too.</b></p>
  <p>Q. Have you ever thought of taking some of the randomness out of the 
  distance traveled with Shadowstep?<br>
  <b>A. Honestly no.&nbsp; I don't know what would be involved in changing that 
  aspect of the spell.&nbsp; I'll write it down, but really its not something we've 
  looked at much before.</b></p>
  <p>Q. Is there any chance that the West Karana spires could be moved somewhere 
  closer to Qeynos?<br>
  <b>A. Despite the fact we added a new druid location to the Surefall Glade you 
  have to understand to graphically move the spires would be a 6 - 7 meg patch 
  that every player would be forced to download.&nbsp; That would just get very 
  messy.&nbsp; It's extremely unlikely we will ever move the West Karana spires this 
  late in the game.</b></p>
  <p>Q. I find as a gnome I am interrupted far more than other races is there 
  any reason?<br>
  <b>A. That really shouldn't happen.&nbsp; Being interrupted is generally caused by 
  a movement of your character not damage.&nbsp; I don't think Gnomes get moved any 
  easier than any other race but I can test it.</b></p>
  <p>Q. Can you give us more information on how the mana cap was changed with 
  Luclin?<br>
  <b>A. You used to only be able to get 1 point of mana for every int/wis over 
  200. They changed that with Luclin and you can get a lot more mana now, but 
  I'm afraid I can't give you any more details than that.</b></p>
  <p>Q. What ever happened to the caster focus items that were coming with 
  Luclin?<br>
  <b>A. Unfortunately even though we did design a bunch of them on paper we just 
  ran out of time in getting them in.&nbsp; I think its important that casters have 
  certain items they really want to chase after like melees do with haste and 
  stuff so hopefully they will get added in when the programmers have some time 
  to get back to them.</b></p>
  <p>Q. Is there any chance of the exact number of mana being shown to a player 
  like for health?<br>
  <b>A. I don't have a problem with the number being shown but there is people 
  on both sides of the argument on the development team.&nbsp; Given how long its 
  been the way it is, it would probably take everyone on the team really wanting 
  it to get it changed so I think it is fairly unlikely it will ever happen.</b></p>
  <p>Q. What is spell shield for since it doesn't prevent melee?<br>
  <b>A. I'm sorry if Wizards have to buff on raids as a cause of this spell 
  going in.&nbsp; But since it stacks with Rune it really is a great spell for 
  helping people live through AoE's.&nbsp; It just means Wizards get to do more good 
  stuff for their group overall.&nbsp; (Spellshield is a magic damage only rune type 
  spell).</b></p>

      <p><img src="/home/purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="8">January 23rd Patch Message... /thank Verant:<br>
<p>All I can say is that was one hell of a patch.&nbsp; Changes effecting 
Wizards are in bold.&nbsp; Thank you, Verant!</p>
<p><b>Quest Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Ragefire portion of the Cleric Epic quest has been changed. Please see the 
  Developer's Corner on our web site for more details</li>
  <li>Added Quest NPCs to Thurgadin, Kael and Skyshrine for Beastlord quest 
  armor</li>
  <li>Gravel leaf tea will now fit in the combine container for the associated 
  quest</li>
  <li>Grimling Blood should now be dropping</li>
  <li>Idia in the bard guild in Kelethin was telling you to turn in a quest item 
  to the incorrect NPC. Changed quest text to reflect the correct NPC to hand 
  the item to</li>
  <li>In Iceclad, Keref Spiritspear won't be so unreasonable when you complete 
  the task that he asks of you</li>
  <li>Citizens in skyshrine no longer defend the 'vermin' spiders</li>
  <li>Increased the drop rate of the Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth</li>
  <li>Bloody Shak Dratha Hearts should now be dropping</li>
  <li>Quest of Nobility should now be working properly</li>
  <li>Increased the spawn rate of Brother Qwinn tenfold</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Item Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Adjusted statistics on equipment that was dropping in the Umbral Plains. 
  Many of the items had AC that was inconsistent with the armor types of the 
  classes. The AC has been reduced on some pieces and raised on others. In all 
  instances where the AC was dropped a different statistic was raised. Several 
  items received a significant upgrade while others were downgraded</li>
  <li>Also in regards to Umbral Plains armor, Ranger has been removed from the 
  plate class armor that was dropping and have been added to the usable classes 
  on the chain equivalent. Bards have been added to the plate equipment list. 
  This might mean that some Rangers will have armor that they can't use. Our 
  Customer Service personnel will trade out that armor for the chain equivalent</li>
  <li>Ghoulbane is now No-Drop</li>
  <li>SoulFire charges can only be used by Paladins (though they can be used 
  from inventory)</li>
  <li>Raised the armor value on many Beastlord specific armor pieces</li>
  <li>Added effects to a few of the Wild Lord's armor pieces</li>
  <li>Added Vah Shir to Imbrued Plate Mail useable races</li>
  <li>Rhino Hide armor is now Druid and Monk usable</li>
  <li>The Crustacean Shell Shield is now magic</li>
  <li><b>Scroll of Knowledge can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, and 
  range slots</b></li>
  <li><b>Scroll of Enlightenment can now be equipped in the primary, secondary, 
  and range slots</b></li>
  <li>Thought Horror Fangs can now be thrown</li>
  <li><b>Iron Scroll of War must now be worn to activate</b></li>
  <li>Cloak of Thorns right click effect should work now</li>
  <li>Runed Bone Fork is now equippable primary, secondary and ranged. The 
  &quot;range&quot; value has been removed to prevent people from accidentally throwing 
  them</li>
  <li>Spider Fur Collar has been given weight 0.0 to be consistent with other 
  pieces</li>
  <li>Dark Cloak of the Sky must now be worn to activate</li>
  <li><b>Sage's Crown is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor</b></li>
  <li><b>Icicle Circlet is now No-Drop to match every other Velious quest armor</b></li>
  <li><b>Bone Collar of the Possessed should no longer cause players to crash 
  when inventory is opened</b></li>
  <li>Idol of Rallos Zek can now be used by ShadowKnights</li>
  <li>Helm of Grim Blessings can now be used by Wood Elves</li>
  <li>Flayed Skin Bracer is no longer a Lore item</li>
  <li>Greaves of Avoidance can now be used by all races</li>
  <li>Steel Threaded Wrist Wraps are no longer lore</li>
  <li>Bravado's Breastplate now grants a larger Hit Point bonus</li>
  <li>Guise of the Hunter can now also be worn by human bards and rogues </li>
  <li>Primal Cudgel now has the proper effect</li>
  <li><b>Added &quot;Recommended Level&quot; equal to the current item use level for the 
  several items. All of these items require the player to be level 51+ to equip 
  them and/or use their effects. Setting the &quot;Recommended Level&quot; field like this 
  just lets the player know what level they need to be to use the item. The 
  actual utility of the item was not affected in any way, this change is purely 
  informational</b></li>
  <li>Several items have been changed to be not useable by Iksar. They had been 
  erroneously set as Iksar useable in the last item patch. These were primarily 
  items that were usable by Beastlords (and were therefore changed to allow all 
  Beastlord races to use them), but that had been specifically restricted from 
  use by Iksar due to their inherent armor value</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Zone Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Shades in Umbral, Maiden's Eye and Vex Thall are now considered undead</li>
  <li><b>Placed portals to and from Great Divide and Nexus</b></li>
  <li><b>Added many new items to better round out the rewards for high-level 
  Luclin encounters</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Horse Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Implemented horse trade in quests. There are now four stable hands who 
  will buy back specific colored bridles located in the stables in the Bazaar</b></li>
  <li><b>Being stunned will now stop players on horses. Not stopping them when 
  stunned was causing warping and other bad things</b></li>
  <li><b>Knockback spells, and spells that throw you into the air, now affect 
  people on horses properly</b></li>
  <li><b>Horses now levitate when their rider should.</b></li>
  <li><b>Fixed a bug that was causing the client to crash when attempting to 
  follow someone while on a horse. /follow should also now work when the person 
  you are following is on a horse</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Spell Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Wizard Familiar spell scrolls will now increase in purchase cost with 
  the spell level</b></li>
  <li>Several spells will no longer be interrupted, spells such as the 'proc' 
  generated by Instrument of Nife</li>
  <li><b>Several spells that were not functioning in the planes have been fixed 
  and now work in the planes </b></li>
  <li>Bards should now gain singing skill when singing and should no longer gain 
  skill in an instrument when they are not using one.</li>
  <li>Characters are no longer damaged by damage shields when using throwing 
  weapons</li>
  <li><b>Atol's Spectral Shackles has had its casting difficulty reduced</b></li>
  <li>Made some changes to Nature's Recovery to make it more stackable</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Visual Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Wolves and warders should no longer appear to be very small</li>
  <li>Characters no longer lose their hair or beard when their illusions wear 
  off</li>
  <li>Weapons should now appear properly (sometimes they wouldn't show up at 
  all) when a player zoned in</li>
  <li>Characters in wolf or bear form (or other races that aren't player races) 
  should no longer have parts of them tinted based on the armor the player was 
  wearing</li>
  <li>Bear form should now look correct to people that zoned in after the spell 
  was cast on them</li>
  <li>May have fixed the problem with extra mouse cursor showing in game</li>
  <li>Fixed a problem with NPCs, PCs and some objects not being visible in some 
  zones (Wakening Lands, Plane of Growth, Emerald Jungle and Swamp of No Hope)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Performance Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>More work on reducing zone times for Luclin city zones</li>
  <li>&quot;Hitch&quot; created when player characters enter a zone should be gone now</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug that could cause the client to crash in some cases where a 
  character tried to purchase an item from a vendor but didn't have enough money</li>
  <li><b>Characters with pets that zone (horses, familiars and warders) should 
  now be able to zone from North Qeynos to Qeynos Hills</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>New Features</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Holding shift while clicking the resolution in the options in game will 
  reduce the resolution. If you are already in 640x480 though, this does 
  nothing. Normal click increases the resolution as it always has and still 
  wraps back to 640 after the highest resolution your machine supports.</li>
  <li>Using 1280x1024 and 1600x1200 resolutions, the /wincolor command, and 
  getting the inventory window in fullview mode are now available to all 
  EverQuest players (these features were restricted only to Velious owners) </li>
</ul>
<p><b>PvP Changes</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>It is no longer possible to bandage others of the opposing deity team on 
  Sullon Zek</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Alternative Advancement Abilities</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>Lowered the reuse time on Rampage AA ability from 15 minutes to 10 minutes</li>
  <li>Rampage is now fixed. Previously was only hitting one target</li>
  <li>Mass Group Buff button should work properly when zoning</li>
  <li>Casting Reinforcement should now work on all buffs cast, not just those 
  cast on yourself</li>
  <li>The Discipline Duelist should now be doing the correct damage when using 
  Chaotic Stab</li>
  <li>LifeBurn should now reset properly after being interrupted</li>
  <li>Dire Charm should now reset properly after being interrupted</li>
  <li>Fixed the Quick Buff ability to work as described</li>
  <li>Leech Touch should refresh properly now</li>
  <li><b>Exodus and Nexus Gate now have a casting time of 1/10th of a second</b></li>
</ul>
<p>All I can say is that I am very, very, very happy with this patch. ;)&nbsp;

<ul>
  <li><font size="2">Wizard pet buff spells do not appear to be functioning

<p><b>Issues Effecting Everyone:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li><font size="2">Reducing loading and zoning times <i>(Note: we have a 
  possible improvement for this on the Test server as of 1-8-02 and hope to have 
  it fixed Live soon)</i></font></li>
  <li><font size="2">There is a very short pause for some players when other 
  players enter a zone <i>(Note: we have a possible fix for this on the Test 
  server as of 1-8-02 and hope to have it fixed Live soon)</i></font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Crashes occurring for some people when logging in</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Some characters being 'stuck' if game crashed while playing 
  that character</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Choppy, buggy, faint or flat sounds for some sound

  <li><font size="2">Partial transparencied NPCs are still showing up half 
  invisible/behind things they're supposed to be in front of.</font></li>
  <li><font size="2">Luclin ports trying to take people that don't have Luclin

      <p><img src="/home/purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="8">Spell System Enhancements:<br>
Included in today's patch were changes to the magical resistances of several high level creatures.
<UL>
<B>
<P>In addition to the melee changes mentioned above, we’ve also made some wide-ranging changes to the way the spell system works, or more accurately, the spell-resist system and how it works in regards to content, specifically content of a high level.</P>

<P>Through our testing we found that many higher level creatures, and especially those creatures that are above 60th level, were typically resisting magical damage to an extent far greater than they should have been. This lead to a couple of classes having their usefulness in these situations either negated or reduced to a pure utility role. As such we’ve made the following changes:</P>
<P>
NPCs now have less of a chance to resist any direct damage spell caused by casters above level 50. Super-high level NPCs have received a large reduction in the level-difference bonus they receive to their resists based upon the level of the attacking player character. We’ve increased the effectiveness of resist debuffs against a large number of higher level NPCs in regard to damage spells being cast upon them. We’ve also reduced the resistances on a wide range of NPCs, especially for NPCs in Velious. Finally, we’ve given our designers more control over the ability to customize any particular encounter. For example previously, if a designer didn’t want a creature to be mesmerisable, he had to give it high magic resistance. Now they can set that feature individually while keeping magic resists reasonable so they don’t take a bunch of classes out of the picture through the need for one feature.
</P>
<P>Players will now also receive messages when an NPC is immune to a particular type of spell, much like messages regarding mesmerization have always been sent. We can do this since the designers have direct control over the effectiveness of certain utility effects, while still allowing damage-causing spells to go through. As an example, NPCs that were always immune to melee-speed debuffs by virtue of the fact that they had a very high magic resistance will still be immune to those spells, but magic-based spells that cause damage or do some other effect that the designer didn’t necessarily want to rule out would now go through.</P>
<P>
Finally, to compensate for increased magical damage, some NPCs have received additional abilities and/or stats. This serves to keep the encounters at a similar level of difficulty while balancing the contribution of melee and casters, rather than engaging exclusively in the melee-heavy strategy of before.

        and Luclin :<br>
        A topic of large debate has been answered by Brad him self on the Trivial 
        Loot Code! 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>Hello all,</b> </p>
        <p><b>I wanted to update you all on our current thoughts regarding the 
          Trivial Loot Code as it relates to Shadows of Luclin zones.</b> </p>
        <p><b>As per my last couple of 'Ask Brads', we've made both an effort 
          to explain what the Trivial Loot Code does and why we were considering 
          it for all Luclin zones. I'd also mentioned, however, that if most players 
          appeared to be against its inclusion we'd not use it.</b> </p>
        <p><b>After talking with players, reading emails and feedback, and then 
          very recently running a poll, it is indeed apparent that the majority 
          of our playerbase does not feel that the Loot Code's advantages outweigh 
          its restrictions.</b> </p>
        <p><b>In fact, after polling over 200,000 players, most want the looting 
          system left alone, almost as many want us to explore a different solution 
          for bottom feeding and rampant farming, and a minority were in favor 
          of the Trivial Loot Code as it exists today in the Warrens and Stonebrunt 
          Mountains (the remainder either didn't have an opinion or were unfamiliar 
          with TLC).</b> </p>
        <p><b>Well, so be it <img src="http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/smile.gif" width="15" height="15"></b> 
        </p>
        <p><b>We will head back to our drawing boards and keep brainstorming on 
          this issue, but at this current time we do NOT intend on implementing 
          TLC for the zones in our upcoming expansion, the Shadows of Luclin.</b> 
        </p>
        <p><b>I do want to thank everyone for all the feedback and discussion 
          regarding this issue -- there was a lot of debate surrounding this issue, 
          and we've done our best to pay attention.</b> </p>

        Driving to work this morning, the news came across that two planes had

        the change to the Staff of Temperate Flux was one that would have nerfed 
        it to only work if wielded. Luckily, Glinlor noticed I didn't follow up 
        with news so he informed me that it <u>does</u> still work from a main 
        inventory slot. The only change is that if we wish to use it as a weapon, 
        it must be held in the Primary Melee slot.</p>
      <p><font size="1">Thanks Glinlor and everyone that posted the confirmation 
        on the forum.<BR>

        Today's patch has a few things that directly effect us as wizards -</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Staff of Temperate Flux has been changed to main hand only.</li>
        <li>Ring of Frost Spiders can now be worn.</li>
        <li>Robe of the Seacaller should now be equipable.</li>
        <li>Changed the way resists are calculated when a Player Character casts 
          a spell on another Player Character on Sullon Zek. Resist modifiers 
          based on level will now be more smoothly distributed and will allow 
          lower level characters a slightly better chance to land spells on higher 
          level characters. At the same time giving lower level characters a slightly 
          better chance to resist spells cast on them by higher level characters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p><font size="1">I'm checking to see if the Staff of Temperate Flux was 
        fully nerfed to only work while equipped.<BR>

      <p><img src="/home/purplepoint.gif" width="8" height="8">Oracle/Tome of 
        Ages Quest:<br>
        I got an e-mail today from an individual that was able to speak to Brad 
        McQuaid (Aradune) about the Tome of Ages quest while they were at the 
        Fan Faire - 
      <blockquote> "I asked him specifically about the Oracle quest and he said 
        that only 2 parts are active. The Torch quest and the pally quest. That's 
        it. I mentioned that someone posted that the full oracle quest had been 
        finished and you had to travel to lots of places including the Hole. He 
        shook his head and said, 'No, that quest is definitely not done'." </blockquote>
      So as we all expected, those items sent in last year that have been labeled 
      "Possible Hoax", are indeed a hoax.
