        you are an evil raced wizard or if you have killed a few barbarians in 
        your upbringing, you are more than likely not too welcomed in Halas. Fret 
        not, it's not as bad as it seems.</font></p>

        guild area </a>in Halas that we evil or KOS wizards need to do our transactions 
        with Dargon/Arantir in is patrolled by two guards. One named Cian McMarrin 
        and his brother, Alec McMarrin. Both of the guards stop right in front 
        of the shaman guild during their patrol and this stopping point is what 
        I will refer to as their starting spot. You can use this <a href="halas/halas_map.jpg" target="_blank">map</a> 
        that I have edited (original created by Aghzul of Solusek Ro) so you can 
        get a better understanding of the guard pathing and the safe spot.</font></p>

      </ul>
      <p><font color="#999999" size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep 
        in mind that their patrol times do not match. This means that the times 
        they will cross paths in front of the shaman guild will vary. If you have 
        the time to wait or are really paranoid about getting attacked, wait for 
        them to leave the shaman guild at the same time. This way you will have 
        a total of 6 minutes and 30 seconds to do your business.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#999999">I 
        reccomend going into Halas invisible and head to the safe spot. Once you 
        have the guard's timing down and it looks safe, run to the shaman guild 
        area and stand <u>behind</u> Dargon, next to the tree. Do not worry about 
        the guild trainer, Shamus Felligan or his brother Waltor. Even though 
        they con 'scowl/attack' they will not attack (you have to trust me on 
        this.. I have personally done it as have many others). Now, drop your 
        invisibility and try to purchase the Ro's Breath potion from Dargon. You 
        can only purchase it yourself if you are apprehensive or higher. Many 
        report that wolf from <u>will not</u> change your faction to Dargon but 
        using a Ball of Golem clay and turning into an earth elemental will work 
        <i>(see the <a href="../../equipment/equipment.htm">Miscellaneous Equipment</a> 
        page for more info on the Ball of Golem Clay)</i> or if you have an Amulet 
        of Necropotence <i>(see the <a href="../../jewelry/_mob_necklaces.htm">Mob 
        Dropped Necklaces</a> page for more info)</i>, skeleton form will work 
        as well.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#999999">If 
        you don't have any luck getting the Golem Clay or an Amulet of Necropotence 
        is out of your reach, you can always get a friend with good faction to 
        Dargon do the potion part of the quest for you. Click below -</font></p>

      </ul>
      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#999999">If 
        you want to try to raise your faction you can try either of the following 
        two quests. Keep in mind that this will take a LONG time and depending 
        on how bad your faction was to begin with, it may never change -</font></p>
