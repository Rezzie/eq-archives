<br />
If it does prevent that too, what's the section of the bill with the language that does so?The federal government still guaranteed unsubsidized student loans.  Basically after a loan is in default for a certain period of time the government takes over responsibility for collection.  It's Obama's whole &quot;they get all the reward, we get all the risk&quot; thing except that was the whole point.  The government takes on some of the risk so that people without credit histories (ie high school students) can borrow money to pay for education, something which can't be repossessed.<br />
<br />
Without the government guarantee there's not much point in calling it a student loan.  It's just a basic unsecured private loan, like your credit card.</div></div><hr />

I imagine the sub-prime market won't be much affected by this.  Unscrupulous cheap-o colleges will still be able to loan ridiculous amounts of money to culinary students.  Meanwhile 10-20 years of infrastructure that companies have built to support regular student loans for typical middle-class students will be shut down and rebuilt by the federal government.  Or, more likely, contracted out to private companies, the difference now being that only actual federal funds will be used.</div></div><hr />

It's just not a government-backed student loan.  You can also get a student loan with the backing of a co-signer, or (in many cases) with a letter of acceptance to a professional program (Medical school, in particular).</div></div><hr />

Presumably, Obama has taken this service in-house for one of two reasons: Either it will save the government money, or it will give the students a better deal (or both). If either of those is true then private industry will just have to suck it up. If neither of those is true, one would indeed wonder why Obama did it.</div></div><hr />

A auto loan is called an auto loan not because the person is buying a car but because the car secures the loan.  Much of the framework of supporting auto loans is based on that.<br />
<br />
Student loans will still exist.  The government must be the lender.  So I stand by what I said, private student loans are outlawed.  It's not a student loan unless it's funded by the government.  It's just a regular old private loan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whether it will be good or not remains to be seen.  Personally I think it will be a wash.  There will be a bunch of shifting around and technical fuck-ups in the short term while the government tries to expand its existing Direct Loan program and will still shell out millions of taxpayer dollars to private corporations eating up most of the savings.  In the mid-term technological innovation will slow, customer service will get worse, and new system will still be really expensive but nobody will really care.  <br />
<br />
And to get into some more far-reaching predictions, I think that eventually, the economic value of education will plummet and many students won't be able to pay back their loans.  Students will default en masse as with the housing crises.  At that point, it'll probably be more convenient to have all those bad loans already owned by the government.  Though it won't necessarily be good for anyone when it happens.</div></div><hr />

I could have sworn he took it in-house because it was one of the cost-saving measures that made the health care reform bill more financially palatable.  Nobody outside of a few big banks is arguing that this won't save the government money - the argument is more along the lines of 'should this be a centralized government function'.  My argument is that it only treats a symptom and doesn't get at the out-of-control pricing going on in higher education.<br />
<br />
Still, it seems to beat the status quo on a macro level, wouldn't you agree?</div></div><hr />

You can also get a student loan with the backing of a co-signer, or (in many cases) with a letter of acceptance to a professional program (Medical school, in particular).So you can get med school loans and maybe a few others.  The bottom line is that existing companies that do student loans are either repositioning themselves in completely different markets, like consulting (http://www.coloradoan.com/article/20100331/BUSINESS/3310307/1002), or they die.

All the associated servicing and record-keeping and customer service and shit will get contracted out.  In some cases, especially for big companies, they will likely bid for the government contracts.  In many cases, like the nonprofit that I linked, bidding for massive government contracts is simply not something they are configured to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
And what does an article about Xerox from 2004 have to do with anything?That article is the result of the last time a Federal Loan Servicing contact went up for bids.  That contract expires this year.  We're likely to see more contracts like that as the Federal Loan program expands.  The point is to show that there's still lots of money going to private pockets, it'll just be different pockets.<br />

Administrative costs, although support for student services and faculty benefit requirements have also gone up. You have to bring in the best, and that costs money. I've heard of some professors getting instant tenure, students accepted to the department, and a handsome bonus for signing up. Otherwise you don't get the prestige, you don't get the names - and you end up being just a scrub school for scrubs and fall through the cracks.</div></div><hr />

But yeah, pretty much everything else you've posted is a valid concern. That being said, I'm not sure how concerned (in the long run) I am about the demise of what has effectively been government-subsidized work, particularly since a lot of those jobs will either be replaced by direct government employment, or by new positions at the companies that win the outsourcing you referred to.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
This.  The difference between student loans and unsecured personal loans is vast, for example you cannot escape the burden of your student loans through bankruptcy because they are government-guaranteed (the federal government promises to pay the lender back if you default).  But bankruptcy is bankruptcy, you can't squeeze blood from a turnip.  Restricting the ability to provide student loans from just any little old loan shark is a good thing, only reputable lenders should have the power to loan money with federal guarantees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Remfin</div><div class="date">April 2nd, 2010, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to show you how wrong Goladus is on this (or being dishonest), the last Student Loan Servicing Contracts weren't in 2004 but in 2009 (http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1735492720090617), and it basically involved all the major student loan players getting contracts. It is my understanding since then essentially every student loan player has gotten a contract of some kind to service loans that &quot;use&quot; to be theirs. Much ado about nothing.<br />
<br />
For those who don't understand, there's basically two parts to loans: the person who loans the money (and reaps the payback), and the person who takes care of the paperwork. The government is taking over the first part, and the same companies are still doing the second part. And since origination of loans under the old program was basically filling out a government form of checkboxes anyway, the only jobs moved by this bill were almost non-existent anyway. 30,000 losing their jobs my ass! Even if those jobs are &quot;lost&quot; it just means they now exist over in the government instead of in the old companies.</div></div><hr />

I haven&#8217;t researched this enough to know if it&#8217;s a good or bad thing; my initial impression is that it&#8217;s basically irrelevant for students, their access to loans, or the cost of college tuition.  There was never a functioning market anyhow once the Government decided to guaranteestudent  loans, risk was already &#8220;Nationalized,&#8221; which is a clue as to why tuition has risen at 4 times the rate of inflation over the last 25 years.</div></div><hr />

The US government paid the interest on the perkins loan, and guarantees the stafford loan.<br />

Sounds like what would happen now is that instead of the government paying the first couple of years interest on the Perkins loan and Stafford loans they just give me extra money in the pell grant.<br />
The thing is, the government subsidized all of those loans to a certain extent. They essentially gave the lender money so that they would make the loans at the mandated rate. The idea was that they would turn around and compete for your business to make the most loans and enjoy a small profit from each. The reality was that the loan offers were pretty much indistinguishable and any promises of customer service were moot because the loans got sold to other lenders later. The biggest competition seemed to be who could offer the best kickbacks to school financial aid offices so their loans would get special treatment. The model pretty much fell apart last year when nobody wanted to make any student loans and students had trouble getting funding.<br />
As for the &quot;loan increases allow the schools to raise their tuition&quot; argument, it has the cause and affect backwards. Loan limit shave lagged behind tuition increases significantly. In the late 80's you could use Stafford loans to pay 1.5 times the cost of a typical state school, now it is around 70%. There are a lot of reasons that schools raise tuition, some more legitimate than others, but loans aren't a major factor.<br />
The things that are actually called private student loans aren't affected by this at all. They do exist, and have special rules and benefits, but those are set by the lenders and not the government--which is why they are the &quot;private&quot; ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Branaman Starbinder</div><div class="date">April 9th, 2010, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a few reasons for a state to provide loans to students:<br />
They make a small profit<br />
They have a legal way to keep track of people<br />
They stimulate and control the intellectual level of their country and its subjects<br />
<br />
The small profit is based on the assumption that you calculate an interest on the loans that pays for the inflation correction, the calculated loss from people defaulting on loans (usually due to death) and the administrative costs. They can create their own administrative office to handle all the communication and administration, or they can sell that task to a private institution like a bank or insurance company. Those institutions only get payed for each account they keep up with, not for the amount of money that is involved. A decent pay back scheme is set up based on expected minimum income and spread out over a 25 year of paying back a monthly fee. People then get the option to pay back more to shorten the term and amount owned to pay back. Interest rates on the loans can be kept very low.<br />
<br />
The debt is owned to the state, so you are legally bound to provide the state with your whereabouts, your employment and all those security numbers and taxes. If you move states, your account will move states to another federal/state approved administration office. If you decide to leave the country, you will get a big bill to pay off your debt before you leave. Sweden even does that better, but that is another story.<br />
And of course, it is both militairy, socially and politically a good idea to have a certain level of educated people in your country. For a country, you need to exists on a certain level. Educated people that are bound to your nation will need jobs, but they will also attract companies that require a certain level of expertise or education. Both can be taxed and bring in more tax money then uneducated lower income workers. Educating your young people not only binds them through several social and political ties to your country, it also increases the economic level of your country .<br />
As long as you provide a basic level to all people, and make sure there is no huge disparity between the lowest incomes and the highest incomes, companies will be able to hire all levels of employment out of the same area. They do not need to go to one nation to hire educated expertise and to another nation to hire blue collar labour. <br />
What you try to prevent is the creation of a parasite class. A parasite class is a class of people that owns so much income generating stuff that they use their huge income to hire people to manage it all, and they end up doing nothing but spent. These parasite-class people will loose any morals because they are no longer confronted with any value vs labour. In europe, these were the Royalty. France chopped off their heads in their revolution. Germany got rid of these groups after WW1. Russia killed them off in their revolution. Chine killed them off in their revolution. In Great Brittain, they failed getting rid of all the parasites, but they did reduce them alot, and luckily, these parasites drank and ate themselves to death. The American Civil war got rid of some of those in the USA, but a new group has emerged by now. And history has shown that those top layers usually get massacred at some point unless you keep them down within reach of the middle class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean this as a serious question. Universities are charging what they can get away with, because they can get away with it. With the ease of getting student loans, there was no longer a reason to keep costs in line with what students could afford, nor provide scholarships. Combine this with reduced funding by states, and you have a recipe for double digit annual price increases. The Chronicle (http://chronicle.com/) frequently has stories about how universities are cutting salaries for staff. Instead of tenured professors (or even a chance at getting tenure), universities are routinely hiring adjuncts to teach classes. Adjuncts frequently earn $1-3k per class per semester (mostly towards the bottom of the range), and have no clue if they're going to have a job next semester. Indeed, if an adjunct files for unemployment during the summer, they are guaranteed to not have a job ever again with that university, as well as the &quot;fun&quot; of having the university fight (and win) the unemployment battle. <br />

California is looking at a 30% increase in tuition for in-state students this year. This is due to a drastic cut in state funding for students.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying it has to be run directly by the government, because that has downsides too, but in each case the natural shape of the marketplace is a highly distorted one. Market forces should be removed from all three as much as is practical.</div></div><hr />

Why has the cost of some degrees gone up by so many hundreds of thousands of dollars per student then? Where is all the money going if, as Tangurena says, it's not going on teaching staff? <br />

It can't all be to the football coaches, can it?<br />

Or was he wrong to call my statement ridiculous that universities should not be for profit?He didn't say for profit- he said private, there is a difference.(To be fair, his use of private was counter to your use of nonprofit.) I disagree with his assessment by the way.  Some of the rate increase is going to teaching and teaching related things. Some of the state school increases are a result of cuts in state funding, what used to be subsidized is now part of tuition. Some of the increase is illusionary too. There is a kind of halo effect when people are looking at schools. Many people, like some in this thread I think, believe that a school can't be as good if it is cheaper. Many schools intentionally overstate the tuition cost with the intention of offering virtually all of their students a large grant. The get more and better students by saying the cost is $30,000 but we'll give you a $10,000 grant than if they just charged $20,000 to begin with. (Not that $20,000 isn't a lot of money.)<br />
The major sports programs are pretty much separate businesses from the universities. They have their own revenue streams</div></div><hr />

I'll have two degrees from UC Berkeley in about two months. It's consistently rated the best public university on earth. I've taken summer classes at Stanford and Duke. Without a doubt, the latter institutions provided a higher quality of education, even if they were more expensive. I can't speak for lower division work, but my own anecdotal experience and most university rankings lists say that private schools are better than public schools.</div></div><hr />

I have it on good authority from one of the top retired tax attorneys in the country there's no such thing as non-profit. Corporations who are labeled non-profit by tax code are allowed to disburse left over moneys to those w/in the corporation.<br />
 <br />
But your point is taken. Actually Universities are supposed to be non-profit by and large. The one I'm going to online however (Strayer) is a for profit school. They are more expensive than State schools, but not by much. It's a VERY different experience than anything I ever had before. AND they are very motivated to see me succeed. The support staff has been amazing so far.<br />
 <br />
In 1980, I had a friend who was accepted at Brown but he couldn't put together enough money to attend ... even with guaranteed loans. We met at Barrington where we'd both been promised full scholarships. In my case, there was a 'computer error.' Instead of $K in grants and loans I got ~2.K and was asked when I could pay the rest. The guy in charge of the computer dept. was asked to resign his position, which he did.<br />
 <br />
Imagine my surprise though when he was the Baccalaureate speaker! Oh, and a friend who worked for their Comptroller they made the same 'computer error' three years running ('80-'83.) I stopped attending classes and just lived in the dorm after ~2 mos of school. The teaching was horrible, and the environment there was just toxic. Think Baptist Mafia. Some of the seniors referred to themselves that way jokingly. I didn't see the humor in it.<br />
 <br />
At the time, Dave Horner was in Who's Who for being the youngest man to be president of a private College. He and his mafia destroyed a school that was Ivy league caliber with their misconduct. You can still get a Barrington degree ... at Gordon College which bought them out.<br />
 <br />
Most interesting part, my best teacher at Barrington informed me at the bacca (my wife graduated) that he was leaving Barrington as he felt he could not teach effectively in such a toxic environment. Talk about affirmation of my own experience and paradigm!!! (He went to Gordon to teach in the fall of '81.)<br />
 <br />
I payed off my federally guaranteed loan but that was all that came out of my pocket. At least I got a place to live from Sept-Dec, and a great job through their placement office. Started part time and parleyed it into full time. (Who knew I was now working for the Baptist Mafia !!!)</div></div><hr />

 <br />
I'm saying that it always looks very simple from 40000 feet up.<br />
<br />
You go to a properly funded large public university with lots of research - the mortal enemy of the school a stonethrow away, and you don't even realize that your argument is making a comparison to people who live in castles and and eat out of crystal? <br />
<br />
I think you are wasting both Stanford AND Berkley's money, then...<br />
<br />
Yeah, no fucking shit they are getting a better education. Maybe you should climb down the oh-so-high tower, looking down from your superior vantage point and see that private also means schools like the ones mentioned, as well as these small private schools which are going into the shitter trying to keep up in the game with what little prestige they have.<br />
<br />
There ARE more colleges out there than The ivy league, and the big ten in fucking basketball, ya know.</div></div><hr />
