      <p> First, let me start by saying thank you to everyone that appreciates 


        this website and the work that goes into it. This donation page is not 


        something I wanted to do. In fact, it is something that many viewers have 


        asked for. That is the main reason I never made news about this donation 


        page.. I figured if you really wanted to make a donation, you'd see the 


        link. </p>


      <p>I keep this website as a hobby and it is, for the most part, fun for 


        me. I do not expect anyone to make a donation but if it is something you 


        wish to do, my thanks go out to you.</p>
