          of Xegony has had it with the current status of our, so to speak, powers. 
          He is holding a wizard forum on <b>Monday, June 14th at 8pm EST</b>. 
          It will be held at the zone drop in Greater Faydark upon the Xegony 
          Server. Some of the topics of discussion are to include:<br>
          <br>
          1. The amount of spell resistance.<br>
          2. The amount of our fizzles.<br>
          3. The ability of magi's to do high damage and yet get things like pets.

        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"> All are 
          encouraged to come as he is trying to get GM's to show so that they 
          can see the number of frustrated Wizards out there. I do not think this 
          should turn into a shouting session. Please refrain from venting at 
          the GM's if they show. We all know that you can get more accomplished 
          with reason. We also need to keep in mind that the boys and girls at 
          Verant have their hands full with many things.. not just the state of 
          the Wizard's woes. Keep a positive attitude, be mature and treat them 
          with respect. With this, I'm sure we can get alot accomplished. Most 
          importantly, BE THERE!</font></p>
