        <p> It seems that you have failed to respond to any comments by the wizard 
          community dealing with the absurd rules that you have proposed for the 
          Wizard Tourney. Is this just disdain for the estate of the wizards, 
          or contempt that we actually care about the skill of our class? 
        <p>To carry forward the questions asked in the rules listing thread: 
      </div>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <div align="left"> Why a "shootout" test? What tactics are there in 
            seeing who has the fastest link to the internet? If spell selection 
            and resist gear is all that is being tested then how can you say this 
            is the Best of the Best? </div>
        </li>
        <li>Why no melee? Isnt this a bit biased considering the number of wizards 
          stating that they maintained their melee skills?</li>
        <li>Why no meeting to discuss the rules as happened for the other BoB 
          tourneys? </li>
      </ol>
      <div align="left"> 
        <p>Seems a bit arbitrary to impose this on the wizard community. Those 
          seem to be the three big questions that you have failed to respond to. 
          The question of clickable items has its defenders based on the abuses 
          in the prior BoB. I dont like it but will conceed it as it _MAY_ unbalance 
          a tactical test. It would be nice if you would be responsive to the 
          wizards who will fight and die for your entertainment.
