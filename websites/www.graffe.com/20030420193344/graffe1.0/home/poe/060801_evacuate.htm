        <p>I've brought this up as a bug with Esther twice with no response. I'll 
          assume its not and then simply ask you: why?<br>
          When the wizard spell Evacuate is cast every mana user in the party 
          is charged mana for the spell. As a 57th cleric with a 200 wisdom this 
          spell costs me a full bubble of mana when cast by a wizard. As far as 
          I know this is the only spell in the game that subtracts mana from every 
          caster in the group when cast.</p>
        <p>This is not the largest issue in the game certainly, but its, well, 
          annoying. Because this spell is normally cast in an emergency when things 
          are going badly the additional mana drain just adds to whatever frustration 
          you already had over things going badly.</p>
        <p>So is this a bug, or a 'feature'? If it is intended, why?</p>

          <p>This *is* intentional. Evac is a group spell. One of its components 
            is a mana drain. That component, just like the Evac, will hit every 
            member of the group. This was added to stop people from Evacing to 
            a relative safe area then have the MOBs come after them where they 
            are near the zone line and can easily escape should things go bad. 
          </p>
          <p>Recently we have changed the interzone teleports to clear agro, so 
            that feature of the spell is a little less important. We have talked 
            about removing the mana drain but have yet to make a decision. Hopefully 
            I can give you an answer sometime soon. </p>
          <p>Hope that clears things up for ya.</p>
