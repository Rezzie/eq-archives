      <p align="left"><font size="2">*Patch Day* </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">Greetings all! The following changes have 
        been implemented on the Live servers: </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font size="2">*Spells/Songs* </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2"> Voltaic Draught, a high level wizard direct damage 
          spell was improperly saving versus resistance to cold. It now appropriately 
          saves versus magic. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The higher level bard song by Brusco was improperly 
          healing the target instead of damaging it. This has been corrected.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2">*Items* </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">The Shadowknight class-specific quest armor, Darkforge 
          armor, has had its weight decreased substantially.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The Runed Fighter's Staff, previously useable by Monks 
          and Warriors, has been restricted to Monks only. The statistics on this 
          staff are much more powerful than normally allowed for warriors. This 
          change is retroactive and will be reflected on items currently in inventory. 
          Though we strive to avoid negatively adjusting items after they have 
          been earned, this item presented a balance issue, making the change 
          necessary. We apologize to warriors that currently own this weapon.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">A data error with the Symphonic Saber, causing it to 
          report "Item out of charges", has been corrected. Due to the dynamics 
          of this particular issue, current owners will need to contact a GM to 
          trade this item out for a new, properly working version of the item.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The Burning Rapier (rogue weapon) has been enhanced. 
          In addition to an increase in statistics, it received a stronger spell 
          effect. The lightsource effect on the weapon has been removed due to 
          an aesthetic rogue desire to be "sneaky" :)</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The effect on the Hangman's Noose will now work properly.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2">*General Changes*</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">Some NPCs in Dalnir were casting spells much too powerful 
          for their level. They have been adjusted. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Pathing information has been updated in Highkeep. NPCs 
          and pets should have a much easier time of navigating the zone.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Some Quest-NPCs were not spawning properly in Rathe 
          Mountains. These issues have been corrected.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">A handful of problems reported with research practice 
          via the Concordance of Research have been corrected. All practice-rune 
          recipes should now work correctly. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Gorilla's in Burning Wood now have a new texture set 
          that properly reflects their undead status. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Fishing should now work properly in Kunark zones.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">/yell now reports the proper direction to people hearing 
          the yell. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Corrected a bug that gave some races the impression 
          that they were allowed to start their character in Cabalis. They were 
          never actually allowed to create the character there, however the indication 
          that they could has been fixed. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Corrected sound issues that were causing some crashes 
          to the desktop in certain cases.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2">We are in the process of patching music files (*.XMI) 
        for zones in which music does not currently work. There are 55 small files 
        (around 2K each) that will be patched over the next couple of days to 
        enable music in all of the affected zones. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The zone of Timorous Deep has been tuned and itemized. 
        Certain aspects of the changes have made certain areas of the zone more 
        dangerous, but the reward should be well worth the risk. Feel free to 
        visit this zone and search out its treasures at your leisure. Note: These 
        changes went in on Monday.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Upon investigation, we discovered a deficiency with the 
        amount of experience being rewarded in many Kunark zones (mostly dungeons). 
        The affected zones have been updated, and adventurers should notice the 
        greater experience reward in return for the increased risk and challenge 
        associated with these zones. </font></p>
