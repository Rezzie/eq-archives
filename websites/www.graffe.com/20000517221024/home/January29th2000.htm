        patch (found on the official EQ Boards):<br>
        <b>Player</b>: Good organization and planning guys ALL damn well you've 
        been "emergency patching" during PRIME TIME HOURS. . .WHY can't this be 
        done in the mornings WHY WHY WHY<br>
        <br>
        <b>Abashi</b>: It is certainly not our preference to do patches during 
        primetime hours, however the existence of a bug in the network code was 
        causing a larger inconvenience to all the players than could be tolerated. 
        This patch should fix the problem with stability that the servers have 
        been experiencing over the last week. I just put up a patch message explaining 
        reasons behind the outage. -Gordon<br>

        people see from time to time. It is normally caused by a memory leak and

        Warning:<br>
        This was sent in by an unnamed viewer: <i>&quot;I found what appears to 
        be a bug last night. I was at the bank in Felwithe. I got my Staff of 
        Temperate Flux recently, and decided to cast it on myself to see if it 
        would affect me, and it did. A friend of mine was next to me, and I decided 
        to see if it would affect him. I targeted him, and right clicked on my 
        staff. Well, then next thing I know, I am dead as every guard in the area 
        beat me to a pulp. After getting my body back, I decided to try again, 
        a little safer, to make sure I didn't have a guard targeted. I targeted 
        a newbie near the entrance to the city and right clicked. I got ran out 
        of Felwithe with guards beating on me as I went. Just letting you know 
        to be careful who you cast that on.&quot; </i><br>
        Although the Staff does no damage, it does cause aggravation (aggro) on 
        any mob. Therefore, it is considered a hostile act and will attract guards 
        within the vicinity. Be careful with your toys... you might shoot someone's 
        eye out. -Graffe.<br>

        Sent in by Aendayar of Povar, this is a rare shot of one person's grand 
        night down in Nagafen's Lair. Here's what Aendayar had to say,<i> &quot;Solo 
        exp on a dragon for a wizard :)... I think there were 5 groups and me, 
        I got 8-10 ice comets off, 0 full resists. This was before the debuffing 
        patch for wizard spells, just shows that we still have hope as a class, 
        I personally wouldnt trade my wiz for 2 lvl 50s of any other classes. 
        He gave me 1/4 bubble exp and about 15pp.&quot;</i><br>

        Last night I logged on around 7:30pm PST and downloaded a new eqgame.exe. 
        No text file came with it to explain what all was patched but I noticed 
        a huge improvement with my SBLive soundcard. Running four speakers and 
        a sub woofer, the sound field is incredible. My partner in crime, Keiote, 
        was casting heals and I could tell exactly where he was located behind 
        me to my right. Simply stunning. If you haven't heard one.. find a friend 
        that has one, sit back and drool. I only pray whatever tweaks they did 
        to the code do not get erased with the next patch (I've seen it before). 
        Good job Verant!<font size="1"><br>

        <i>&quot;Hello, I just wanted to let all my fellow wizards have a heads 
        up in the PoS. We will do more damage melee'ing. We had several enchanters, 
        shaman, and mages in Sky last night, casting Tashinia/Malise and such, 
        yet on almost every mob we fought, I was getting complete resists with 
        fire, ice and magic. Occasionally, on certain mobs, I would get some damage 
        through once or twice throughout the course of the fight, 112 dmg was 
        the max I was able to hit for with conflaguration. So, if you go there, 
        expect to do little or no damage, I personally now melee with the tanks

        Bind/gate/port/shadowstep type spells do not work here. However, an interesting 
        note..while you can't cast those spells..you Can still cast alter plane 
        spells, so if you're overladen with cash you could probably use an extra 
        stone to maybe pull mobs back to the main island to fight them without 
        having to train extra mobs to the fighting party...may or may not work 
        depending on the aggro range of the zone. Also this would be 1 way to 
        escape the genie cave(which is the old room the GMs/Guides used to go
