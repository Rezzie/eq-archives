      <p align="left"><font size="2">Today's follow-up patch addresses the following 
        issues from yesterday's patch: </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">The spell Torpor received an unintentional reduction 
          in effectiveness </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Illumination in game was not as bright as it should 
          have been. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Pet using classes unintentionally gained the ability 
          to summon multiple pets.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Bard songs were reacting poorly with invisibility/hide/sneak. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Hitpoints were being reported incorrectly to clients. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Changing resolutions would cause some to crash. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2">In addition, the following changes were left out of yesterday's 
        patch message:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">Fixed a bug that would cause some to not be able to 
          cast after being feared. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Data for group members and targets will be updated 
          more frequently. This change should reduce complaints of warping and 
          slow hitpoint and other updates.</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Bards received increases in the skill cap for their 
          instrument skills. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Changed the default combo for casting spells from CTRL-1:8 
          to ALT-1:8, as CTRL was interfering with players ability to strafe. 
          </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2">Thank you for your continued patience. </font></p>
