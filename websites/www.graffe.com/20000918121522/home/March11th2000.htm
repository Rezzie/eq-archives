      <blockquote> 
        <p>The Wizard Rune Trading/Social is now being held at the <b>Wizard Spires

          for those who need them. Bring runes to donate or trade. Librarian has 
          runes from level 16 to 49, as well as several premade level 44 and 49 
          spells. Wizards with max research will be on hand to combine runes.

        <p><b>Abashi</b>: We've investigated this and really don't feel that there's 
          a problem after the patch that included the innate resistance debuff 
          for wizards 35 and above. As usual, I'll suggest that you hang out with 
          a shaman, enchanter, magician, or even a Necro. They all have the ability 
          to debuff resistances. You might consider a bard as well. </p>
        <p>Much like the Warrior, the wizard isn't meant to be a class that goes

        Since yesterday's news on the Oracle Robe being no rent, I've recieved 
        a few reports that conflict eachother. The original submitter researched 
        it and informed me that a Druid killed the Oracle and the robe was indeed 
        no rent. Since yesterday I have had one Prexus player say they have killed 
        the Oracle and the robe was <u>not</u> no rent (a few others claim it 
        has not changed but they did not state thier server of play). All of this 
        started when the Prexus server GM created a MOTD (message of the day) 
        stating that if you kill the Oracle in the Ocean of Tears, you will get 
        the robe but it will be a no rent item. If you have a picture of the no 
        rent version of the robe, send it in. That is really the only way to find 
        out for sure. Well, unless the Povar GM is reading this and wishes to 
        inform me.. highly doubtful.<br>

        Kodros Cicero of the Prexus Server sent in word that the Oracle Robe is 
        now a 'no rent' item (dissapears upon log out) if you acquire it by killing 
        the Oracle outright. This leads me to believe that the quest that involves 
        him may have been tweaked a bit. I personally, have noticed a change in 
        the text upon a piece of parchment acquired at the beginning of the quest. 
        Even if this has been migrated to all servers, I doubt it will end the 
        farming of the robe, but at least it might allow some to try the quest.<br>

        Using the data from the test server's spell listing, I created a list

        Many things can change before the release and Verant has been known to 
        throw bad data in those files to confuse us players. Right now, our DD 
        line of spells is lacking (in my opinion) but they flooded us with a lot 
        of AoE's. Perhaps they are pushing us to use our best mana/damage ratio 
        spells. Time will tell once Kunark is released and I'm sure we'll see 
        some different numbers for the damage they inflict. I tried my best to 
        squeeze some info out of GZ, but as I expected, he could not disclose

        <p> Hi there! Just wanted to get the word out that me and a team of friends 
          have started a great new site called TheSky.Org (<a href="http://www.thesky.org" target="_blank">http://www.thesky.org</a>). 
          Our goal: To provide the EverQuest community with an online 'news ticker', 
          updated daily with general news, server specific news, and forum posts 
          by the EQ team. (Our forum logs section will eventually evolve into 
          a megaplex of every post made by any EQ staff member in the past and 
          present!) All info is collected from the many EQ related sites across 
          the internet and presented in clean, "plain jane" form for easy surf-free 
          reading.</p>
        <p>Our hope is that TheSky.Org will not be competition for various sites 
          (like Graffe's), but a gateway of EQ information to all the great sites 
          that are out there. </p>
        <p>So please, drop by and enjoy the fruit of our labors thus far! </p>

        being taken advantage of. In order to prevent this and to keep these rules 
        constant many of the High level Wizards of E'Ci met and agreed on a new 
        set of rules. These rules can be found at <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/games/eciwizards" target="_blank">http://www.angelfire.com/games/eciwizards</a>

        Naeamen Templar sent in this issue - <i>&quot;If you in zone port in Gfay 
        (Like you are at the bank and you want to get to the gfay spiers to get 
        to BB or Lfay faster, because we know wizards are lazy :-)) you cannot 
        zone out of Gfay into any connecting zone (BB, Lfay, Felwith A, CB) and 
        camping doesn't fix the bug. What you have to do is teleport out of Gfay 
        and then back into Gfay to fix it.&quot;</i><br>
        Thanks Naeamen<br>

        Today's patch was primarily comprised of server-side changes in preparation 
        for the release of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark. Only one gameplay-affecting 
        issue was updated as a result of this patch: 
      <p> - Being killed by another player in a duel will now cause you to re-spawn 
        with zero mana. 
      <p> This change was implemented to counter a strategy used by casters where 
        they would duel to reduce downtime between fights, thus allowing groups 
        to engage creatures that they normally would not be able to. 
      <p> - The EverQuest Team<br>

        The bug that plagued Wizards and all caster classes since last Thursday's 
        patch, seems to have been alleviated. I created newbie characters of all 
        classes and each was able to wear a few different types of headwear. If 
        you have had different results, please e-mail me with your race/class 
        combo as well as your server and type of headwear you were using.<br>

        The Miscellaneous Armor section had been growing beyond a viewable size 
        (much like the equipment page is now) so yesterday I created a page just 
        for Waist Armor. I will continue to do this with other listings to help 
        with the viewing and to speed up the download time of each graphic intensive 
        page.<br>
