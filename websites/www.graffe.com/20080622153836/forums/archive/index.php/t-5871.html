<br />
My usual hunting partner is a wizard, level 44 while I am a 45 mage. I was wondering, what kind of hunting tactics would you use in such a pair? We both have jboots, fairly good equipment, and my friend has that clicky aggro stick. The only tactic I can really think of is having my friend kite while my pet beats on the mob from behind, but that seems rather inefficient. Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarta</div><div class="date">December 21st, 2001, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not inefficient at all.  For single pulls, I'd suggest standing in a central area that he can comfortably kite around.  Have him pull with snare and then kite in circles around you.  He will want to nuke just enough to hold agro.  The two of you should nuke enough to get the full xp from the kill -- otherwise, allow the pet to do as much damage as possible in order to conserve mana.<br />
<br />
This will be even easier once you get the level 54 (?) water pet which backstabs.<br />
<br />
If done properly, you should both have a minimum amount of down-time and your pet should not be endangered at all.<br />
<br />
Quad-kiting is not necessarily the most mana-efficient means to kill things when partnering.  If the two of you can spend less than a bub of mana to kill something, you will find that you are able to kill far more mobs in the span of an hour then you would quadding.<br />
<br />

Hope this helps,<br />

<br />
Have pet solo mob for a bit to build up agro, then wiz and mage use rains on the mob.<br />
<br />
After wiz and mage cast about 2 rains each, mob should be fleeing...just med up while pet finishes it off.<br />
<br />
Good luck =)</div></div><hr />
