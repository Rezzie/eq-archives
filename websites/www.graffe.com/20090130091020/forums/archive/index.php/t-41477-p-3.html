I've thought about re-activating my account. It's just that the last time I played, I was just doing Research and a little mining here and there.<br />
I just got bored silly with it.<br />
Maybe I should just stick with combat missions for faction instead?<br />

Oh, I know I have a few places I could go if I wanted, just trying to figure things out right now. I wouldn't mind joining a 0.0 corp again if I could play in empire for months at a time and not feel like i'm getting bitched at.</div></div><hr />

ATM I'm patrolling parts of southern Derelik, but my corp moves around to follow the targets, and atm we're helping Blood of The Innocents with thier war against Curse Coalition, so I think we'll be here for abit, but we do rove around i'm told, so I will not become a hermit.  And I do it because I like the thrill of 1v1 combat, and I am a nice pirate who is polite, collects his ransom, thanks the ransomee, and  I go on my merry way to a SS to wait for my aggression countdown.</div></div><hr />

This will increase your power grid, CPU and armour hit points. Also look into the navigation skills. After burner, evasive manuavering, fuel conservation, acceleration controll.<br />

later on, you'll want to train up the shield and armour compensation skills to increase your resists when using hardeners.<br />

Train up to cruiser 5 and then go for recon cruisers. They are one of the most overpowered platforms in the game atm. And I'm not seeing any rumbling that would suggest a nerf is imminent.</div></div><hr />

let me state some reqs for EW:<br />
<br />
1) Electronics 5 - this is a foundation skill. Get ASAP.<br />
2) Electronics Warfare 4 - Everything EWish opens to the tech 2 level at 4. <br />
3) Signal Dispersion - increases strength of target jamming mods, thus increasing the probability of success with jamming w/ a given single mod.</div></div><hr />

It's what I did and I'm pretty happy with the results.  There were times I'd switch out of learning skills because there was an item I wanted to fit on my ship, but for the most part the first four weeks or so were devoted almost entirely to learning skills.  It's paying off though now that the skills are taking 22 days plus to finish.</div></div><hr />

The industrial ship in the video, plus large battleships and battlecruisers handle like a brick in mud, so their turns look like they are rolling - battleships actually lay on their sides as they turn.<br />

Once you purchase the skill, you can ~read~ the book (train for that skill).  The &quot;simple&quot; skills can be purchased through many of the School stations while other &quot;complex&quot; skills I believe are given as rewards.  Also, many skills' difficulty are rated by a ranking number, which means a multiplier in the amount of skill points required to reach the next skill level.  As an example, Engineering 1 is a Rank 1 skill, which would take depending upon your primary and secondary stats approximately fifteen minutes (or less).  But Battlecruisers 1 is a Rank 6 skill, which again depending upon your primary and secondary stats, would take around six times as long to train.<br />

Hopefully this will help a bit.<br />

Mining in the newbie areas and completing the tutorial should earn you one training skill book and at least 100k cash.  The basic learning skill books are 45k each - though sometimes you can find them a bit cheaper.<br />
<br />
When I started I made over 500k doing mining and low level drone missions.</div></div><hr />

This is normal I think.  I had the same problems when I first started doing level 1 missions.  Train your gunnery skills up a bit and try trading tactics.  One thing that helped me is that I went all druid on 'em early on.  I'd set my distance to my optimal range and use long-distance ammo (along with an afterburner) and kill everything before they got close enough to fire, and kite the adds at distance while I picked their buddies off.  It doesn't work as well on those really fast drones, but it works well on Mordus ships.  Also train up skills and mount a webifier.  The slower the other ship goes the better you can track it.  When things get especially dicey don't feel any shame in warping back to your base then back into the mission.  I tended to do that quite a bit earlier on.<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope to have some time in-game to see you guys soon!<br />

Mods, can we get a FOLDER underneath the Other Games heading at least?  This 19 page thread could easily be about ten different topics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One Tactic I used successfully against the Mordus was Hit &amp; Run.  What's your Loadout Specifically?<br />
<br />
My Rifter Loadout was 3 250mm Artillery (Using Phased Plasma), 1 Missile Launcher (with Sabertooth Missiles), <br />
Mediums:  cold-gas i arcjet thruster Afterburner, Webbifier, Civ shield Booster (just cause that was about all the Power/CPU I could afford to mount - it was either that or an Empty Slot)<br />
<br />
Lows:  Armor Repairer, 2 Reactor Control Units (to give me the Power grid Necissary to run all that stuff)<br />
<br />
For Heavy Hitters like the Mordus - I'd Pick a Point Near the cluster of their Ships, (start from around 20K out) - Zip in fast as you can with afterburner Going, Start Firing the Missile Launcher at 18-17K  Range, Open up with the Guns around 13k, and Just Travel straight through - as you leave Range if the Target is still alive deactivate Guns/Missiles at the Appropriate range - Let your Shields Regen, Repair the Armor.  Rinse Repeat.  I'd Pick the Toughest Longest Ranged (Gladius Probably, he'll hit out to 20K) ones off First.  The Rookies Effective Range is Only around 6K or so, -- So they shouldn't get That many shots off on you as you pass through.<br />
<br />
It takes time, but you can Definatly do it.</div></div><hr />

How I'd set up for this would be 3 250mms and a rocket launcher in the top.<br />
Named AB, Webber and a TP in mids, with an armour rep and nano's in lows.<br />
<br />
My alt with engineering V and electronics IV can fit that. <br />
<br />
I also highly recomend getting engineering, mechanic, electronics, and energy management to 5, 5, 5, and 4, respectively. Getting Engineering to 3 and Energy management to 4 will allow you to use Micro Auxiliary Power Cores. A handy little tool for frigates. They provide a straight +10 to your grid, not 10% but 10 extra grid, at the the cost of 15 CPU. <br />
<br />
The hit and run tacktic will work just fine but you'll need to be really close for rockets to work well, but the painter will help from a distance and once you hit 10km use the webber. Webber + painter + arties = hurt pirate.</div></div><hr />

I'd take Hull Upgrades to IV instead of Mechanic to V.  Hull Upgrades increases armor, Mechanic only does structure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Atelen</div><div class="date">September 23rd, 2006, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I played around some and managed to take out the Mordus ships. My current loadout is two 280mm Howitzer I's using Titanium ammo, and a 250mm Artillery using EMP ammo. Using EMP ammo and playing keepaway did the trick, although the gladius in particular was hard to crack open.<br />
<br />
I currently have a small shield booster in medium and a hull plate (can't remember which, but adds about 50-60 armor), a small armor repair, and an inertial damper (-14%) in the lows. I'm waiting on skills to get the ability to loadout the medium slots with other things, and I still have a fourth high slot to put something in, although I'm not sure what.</div></div><hr />

I've been chatting with Xahil, and he's ben having no trouble ripping them open with his Gallente Incursus + Hobgoblin, but I'm having no end of difficult in my Rifter. What gives?Ok, here is how I killed anything a mission guy asked me to kill in a Rifter. This is sorta a wizard kiting tactic.<br />
<br />
Outfit ship like this:<br />
<br />
Standard Missile Launcher I [Flameburst Light Missile]<br />
Standard Missile Launcher I [Flameburst Light Missile]<br />
280mm Howitzer Artillery I [Nuclear S]<br />
280mm Howitzer Artillery I [Nuclear S]<br />
<br />
1MN Afterburner I<br />
Small Shield Booster I<br />
Cap Recharger I<br />
<br />
Reactor Control Unit I<br />
Power Diagnostic System I<br />
Overdrive Injector System I<br />
<br />
That can be fitted with a minimum of skill training. The tactic works like this.<br />
<br />
pre) have &quot;Keep Distance&quot; set to max distance on guns. Should be around 21,000 km<br />
<br />
1) Hit Afterburner immediately after warping in<br />
2) Select closest enemy after warping in and hit keep distance<br />
3) Now target that closest ship (never fire on this ship until everybody else is dead, this guy is the spacer that keeps you from having to worry about your kiting distance)<br />
4) Target a second ship and hit it with all guns.<br />
5) Target as many ships as your skills/ship allow<br />
6) Kill ships one at a time with all fire power on single ship (try to kill elite such and such first)<br />
7) Pulse shield booster if shield set to far down (ideally keep shields above 50%)<br />
8) Be extremely careful to keep moving. The spacer ship does this, but it's still important to say. Let the enemy ships catch up and your a dead wizard (or you warp out).<br />
9) Kill last ship and loot<br />
<br />
With the above ship equipping you will be able to fly with afterburner turned on at like 900 m/s, which is faster than any NPC ship will fly in level 1 missions. Also with those long distance (for a frigate) guns and that amo you will be able to keep yourself out of your enemies optimal firing range while keeping them in yours.<br />
<br />
It would be better to use one Auxiliary Power Control instead of the Reactor Control and Power Diagnostic System, but that requires a skill at level 4 and I was trying to keep the skills easier to acquire.<br />
<br />
Also, one might go 3xGuns and 1xMissile, but I like missiles.</div></div><hr />
