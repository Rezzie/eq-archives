<br />
Not only that but they could handle Goons, and an attack by any other major alliance shy of only ASCN or The Coalition, at the same time.  (And those 2 exceptions are only due to the size of the potential attackers.)<br />
<br />
The reasons behind this little war are really dramatic if you read through the threads, its actually pretty screwed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zruu</div><div class="date">July 28th, 2006, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, BoB is digging up a months-old misunderstood sig joke referring to a years-old tasteless comment made before GoonSwarm/Fleet was even an idea and using the corpse of their friend as justification for declaring war even after the Goons publically apologised and booted the offending corpmember out.<br />
<br />
Pretty screwed up, all right.<br />
<br />
As for BoB's strength - you think that they'll be able to maintain a 23/7 camp of npc stations in Syndicate for months on end without it taking a toll on their own membership...let alone what BoB's other rivals are going to do during the window of opportunity. What if ASCN suddenly pops up in one of BoB's ally/vassal corp regions with their entire fleet and starts taking things over? Are BoB going to stay in syndicate, camping Goons? Fight a two-front war? Try to claim that ASCN are insulting the memory of their dead friend as well?</div></div><hr />

Even suggesting that they would need to drag up Smoske's name as a means to attack someone in a game is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
The whole thing is screwed up.  But most of BoB was really close with Smoske, and the fact that the guy got kicked out of Goons (months after the offending sig, and ONLY AFTER it got brought to the community's attention) means that BoB isn't going to have any problems running them back to Empire.<br />

<br />
In short, Yes.  BoB has done it before.  They camped FA in until they were nothing more then a footnote.  I've personally been on the recieving end of it, and they are more then capable of fighting a 2 front war.  You have to realize that BoB is THE uber guild of EVE.  5 Corps make up the alliance, and 3 of those corps can handle major invasions by themselves.  They love it, and their leadership knows it.  Its actually pretty amusing how much they love playing the political game.</div></div><hr />

The others aren't stressing to their members what it's going to take to survive BoB.  Surviving BoB is fielding a fleet that can engage at 200km or greater distances.  Surviving BoB is having very good FCs along with the player base that will drop what they're doing and answer the call when needed.  Surviving BoB is also spamming large towers on all of your moons.<br />
<br />
Beating BoB is more than one or two Alliances being prepared to survive BoB and joining forces when BoB attacks.  Beating BoB is at least another six months away and only possible if BoB leaves the S and SE alone in that time and then it's only possible if BoB attacks.</div></div><hr />

As far as BoB and Goons go, I am backing the goons on this one.  What they did with the sig was pretty tastless, but it was also on their private forums.  I really hate the arrogance of BoB, which is surprising considering I was in ATUK heh.  Sadly I think that D2 and BoB will ally for this and crush the goonies.<br />

Command ships are great in fleets!<br />

I'm only semi-effective out to around 150-160km right now.  I'm training up for tech2 large artillery which will put me out to around 210-215km with my current skills.  When the tier 3 BSs become available the fleet ops range will be pushed out another 50km for BoB, RA, LV and those like them.</div></div><hr />

I really don't think this trend towards ranged combat is good for eve. It completely devalues tackling and really EW, tbh. I dont mind EW being irrelevant as I believe it is hopelessly overpowered, but still.....how much fun can you have just lining up at 200+ km and having sniping battles?</div></div><hr />

Goons, GoonSwarm, GoonFleet (etc) = Corp full of SomethingAwful members.<br />
BoB (Band of Brothers) = Closest thing there is to an uberguild in EVE...and canny politicians, to boot.<br />
D2 (Dusk &amp; Dawn) = Paper Tiger that used to be thought of as a serious, strong corp.<br />
<br />
Background<br />
Some Goons went wandering a while back (a month or so), and discovered that one of D2's solar systems has lost sovereignty (D2 used to control it, but it had lapsed). The Goons, for a laugh, attacked. D2 panicked, and fought back. Goons were winning (probably)...which wasn't something BoB was expecting to happen just yet. This raised a few warning flags for BoB. Anyway, D2 zergs the system they used to control with POSes (Player Owned/Operated Stations) - the corp or alliance with the majority of POSes controls the system.<br />
<br />
Goons mention that they're going to make a serious attempt at kicking D2 out this weekend. Suddenly, BoB take offence at a months-old sig and comments made by the commander of GoonSwarm a year and a half ago (before GS was even created). They demand a full and public apology, and the offending member to be booted otherwise there'll be a fight!<br />
<br />
Goons reply by kicking the offending corpmember out, and making a full and public apology.<br />
<br />
BoB says &quot;Sorry, not good enough. We're going to drive your entire corp to quit EVE to avenge the memory of our dead friend. And stuff. Totally not an excuse!&quot;<br />
<br />
Goons say &quot;Screw you then. Blokey is rehired, and bring it!&quot;<br />
<br />
EVE-Online forum members: &quot;ZOMG, teh Goonz R ebil!&quot;<br />
<br />
Goon management says: &quot;Oh yeah, and we're also lifting the ban on our members from posting to the Eve Online boards. Cry havoc!&quot;<br />
<br />
Now<br />
<br />
By their leader's own post, in order for BoB to declare victory they have to either force GS to disband, or force all of the goons to quit. Anything less than that is a defeat. BoB's fleet is significantly smaller than GoonSwarm in numbers, and their tactics are based around Tech2 (read: expensive-to-extortionate prices) ships and gear. Therefore, they cannot afford to be drawn into a drawn-out meatgrinder of a war, or a guerrilla conflict. They also have other, powerful enemies watching them and waiting for a moment of weakness. To use a RL comparison: In Vietnam, they would be the US.<br />
<br />
In order for the Goons to win, they just have to survive. Bearing in mind that their current home sector is full of NPC (i.e. unconquerable by anyone) spacestations, and also bearing in mind that most goon tactics are centred around tech1 (read: cheap) ships and gear, the optimum strategy for the Goons is guerrilla warfare combined with zergs against key ships (BoB dreadnaughts, carriers, motherships). To continue the metaphor: In Vietnam, they would be the Viet Cong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quick example of tech2 vs tech1.<br />
<br />
There is an Amarr frigate called the Executioner. It is fast and not particularly sturdy. It costs about 30.000 ISK to buy the hull. The cheapest tech2 version is the Crusader, an interceptor based on the same hull. It costs around 2,000,000 ISK to buy the bare hull - around sixty times as much as the T1 version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They (my friends) seem fairly pumped for this war, and not for any e-peen reason but just because they enjoy the whole, as they say, &quot;Pew pew space laser gun&quot; aspects of the game.<br />
<br />
If my friends' mentality is anything like the rest of GS, I'd say they will &quot;win&quot; just because they aren't as psychologically affected by losing stations / ships / getting podded as a lot of the EVE community is.<br />

As a matter of fact, I think if they represent the Goon mentality, they might just enjoy getting blown up.:wtf:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gotta call BS on a couple points here.  D2's response, while horribly unorganized at first, due to some internal politics, as can be seen by the splintering of corps from D2, was still pretty much smacking the goons around due to their horrendous SP and experience advantage.  Not to say the Goons haven't gotten in their licks, but they only managed to get sov of the system because the corp that was controlling sov of the system split off from D2.  And then again only because they have the SMASH dread fleet backing them up.  Goonswarm by themselves can field only a handful of dreads at the current time.<br />
<br />
About the bolded part.  That never happened.  The sig got linked onto the EVE-O forums, within about an hour it got pointed out to Molle, and then he posted his one simple word on the forums, &quot;Goodbye.&quot;  After the community found out that this was a running joke within Goonswarm, the reaction was a lot of hostility.  And frankly, some of the local chat, and the few WTB Smoske's Corpse threads that have popped up in the forums have dug the Goons into a hole.<br />
<br />
<br />
(read: expensive-to-extortionate prices) ships and gear.<br />
<br />
The whole Tech 2 expense problem doesn't exist for BoB.  The reason being, they own the majority of the Tech 2 BPOS in existence.  BoB members only pay cost for T2, which makes any war for them easily sustainable, because the majority of them don't have lives outside of EVE.<br />
<br />
Some FCs and some alliances' fleets in general have an uncanny knack for warping off and re-engaging from a different locale before their enemies can take advantage of covops ships.<br />
<br />
Ironically when BoB rode to the rescue of FIX in Q, the combined SMASH/SA/Huzzah fleet would constantly try to warp in on us, because we had roughly 2/3rds their BSs, but all Tech 2 to their handful of T2.  The fights were literally hours of warp in, snipe, they warp in, we warp out, snipe, etc...</div></div><hr />

Fit the closest range ammo/charges/crystals you can and carry some webber drones.<br />

Won't garuntee you any hits but whom ever you do hit at that range is pretty much gonna insta-pop.<br />

For those that don't know, the longe range ammo does poor damage. Also those sniping vesels don't carry much in the way of tanking, so it's mostly damage, sensor and targeting mods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I noticed a personal invitation for chat from some player with numbers in the name that I never heard or saw before.  Though I was monitoring the Rookie Chat and occasionally adding a comment, I did not see this person.  But I figured perhaps someone needed some help so I accepted the invitation but said nothing.<br />
<br />
Other person: &quot;Y did u ask to talk?&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;You asked me for the personal chat.&quot;<br />
Other person: &quot;o mustav hit the wrong buttun&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;No problem - no harm done.&quot;<br />
Other person: &quot;since u r here, want to join my corp?&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;My skills are not high enough to be worthy of corp status.&quot;<br />
Other person: &quot;dose not matter - taking every1 2 days to 2 months played&quot;<br />
Me: &quot;I'll think about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
A few minutes later, I see this same person ask on the Rookie Chat just how much it costs to start a corporation.  By this point, I was quiet on the chat line since I was doing various other things.<br />
<br />
Other person: &quot;want 2 giv me sum money for teh corp?&quot;<br />
I just close the window.  A few minutes later, I get another invite, from another unknown person and just refuse outright.<br />

Dumb asses...</div></div><hr />

To bad that was probably an alt, or, you could track that person down in low sec space and... :evil: <br />
<br />
Speaking of which, had one of those, &quot;oh, sh*t&quot; moments yesterday killing rats in 0.0.  Some dude warped into the belt I was, IN A SHUTTLE!  I checked him out, and had a high sec rating.  He watched me for a few, the warped out.  I almost warped out at that point, but, decided to keep an eye on local (there were only 3 of us there at the time) for a gang popping in.<br />
<br />
Well, much to my relief, none ever showed up.  I either scared the guy because I was taking on 2 Serp Megathron's at once, or, he was just out joyriding in his shuttle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the &quot;spies on TS&quot; edge that some alliances enjoy. It's quite pathetic actually. As a former FC whose had a perfect gank sabotaged by that, I just recoil from the idea that what the opposition couldn't win on the battlefield through ingame mechanics, they had to instead grab through out of game espionage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Won't garuntee you any hits but whom ever you do hit at that range is pretty much gonna insta-pop.<br />
<br />
For those that don't know, the longe range ammo does poor damage. Also those sniping vesels don't carry much in the way of tanking, so it's mostly damage, sensor and targeting mods.<br />
<br />
Proving that I'm a devious bastard, I utilized the &quot;sniping posture&quot; to my advantage, not precisely in the manner in which you suggest, but certainly the same spirit is there. I'll fit the &quot;sniper&quot; to run(you know what that means, wcs baby). And then park a t2 precision cruise raven cloaked in a close safespot aligned to the sniping perch. Gankers warp in and try to tag the sniper is when I play it cool for a bit and soak up a lil damage on the sniper whilst the raven is warping in. If it's .3 and below(which it usually is), I'll have a carrier assign 5 fighters to the raven as well. When the raven arrives on the scene and tackles the interloper, the sniper scoots off to a SS. <br />
<br />
7 mil sp is missiles on the raven guy with 5 carrier fighters assigns tends to rain on their parade. <br />

The &quot;chess game&quot; in Eve tactically is where the replay value is for me. It's totally immersive to sort out things and adapt for the next go around such that the result goes your way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you buy and sell items below the typical costs?<br />
<br />
I see the one screen that has buyer and seller options, but seem a tad lost on how that works.  As an example, a skill book can be bought for one million credits from one of the numerous npc sellers.  Yet selling the same book might net a person say 100,000 credits.  So I want to place an order for one book at perhaps 500,000 credits so overall both buyer and seller would make a profit.  I would want to buy one book and one book only too.<br />
<br />
As for these massive gang wars that are raging: phew phew phew (which translates into my destroyed frigate, my destroyed pod, and my destroyed clone)...  :(</div></div><hr />

sometimes it costs less to buy the minerals and have a friend build the battleship for you. There is also mining (maybe we can do a graffite mining op?) though you'll still have to buy some of the high ends.<br />
<br />
You can try to play the market to make cash. Buy low sell high. There's even a trade channel that you might be able to take advantage of. <br />

Maybe if you join a corp you they can help you out some.</div></div><hr />

I can fly Minmatar T1 ships up to Carrier/Dread, with T2 guns, and Amarr BS with one character. Hes actually working on Jump Drive Op 5 atm, so I can train Jump Drive Calibration.

<br />
T1 Caldari Ships up to Dreads, If I dropped the cash on the capital skillbooks, with T2 Torps, HACS/Recons and large barges, on another.  Hes on his last few days of Med Hybrid to 5, so I can use T2 rails on the Moa, and train for T2 rails for the new Caldari BS.  This guy also has perfect refine skills.<br />
<br />
And Gallente BS, Large Barge, and Itty 5, and training Gallente Command Ships/Leadership stuff with another.  And perfect production skills on this guy.<br />
<br />
I really need to start playing again, I've been out of it for a little over a month now due to graduating, new job, and then moving...  Its really nice to be able to just log in occasionally to swap skills training and still be progressing while having no actual time to play.</div></div><hr />

The whole &quot;fly different types of ships&quot; thing is one of the biggest attractions beyond the &quot;space chess game&quot; aspect of Eve. I LOVE flying and training for new ships. <br />

I can fly virtually everything in the game short of Titans. I have a pilot with skills to fly a mothership but currently due to lack of manufacturers for those behemouths, he flies a carrier. <br />
<br />
On the opposite end, size wise, I'm training one of my gallente alts to flt an Eris interdictor. Another two weeks or so and I'll be a WCS stopping machine :) I get very excited when I think of how more kills I would have had with a way to counter stabs like a dictor provides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
T1 Caldari Ships up to Dreads, If I dropped the cash on the capital skillbooks, with T2 Torps, HACS/Recons and large barges, on another.  Hes on his last few days of Med Hybrid to 5, so I can use T2 rails on the Moa, and train for T2 rails for the new Caldari BS.  This guy also has perfect refine skills.<br />

And Gallente BS, Large Barge, and Itty 5, and training Gallente Command Ships/Leadership stuff with another.  And perfect production skills on this guy.<br />

I really need to start playing again, I've been out of it for a little over a month now due to graduating, new job, and then moving...  Its really nice to be able to just log in occasionally to swap skills training and still be progressing while having no actual time to play.<br />

IF any graffies want, I'll sell you most of the &quot;stuff&quot; in my hangar for a flat price if you haul it off and sell it (or repross it).  I've probably got 150 modules in my hangar, and, will have a hard time selling it all without hauling it someplace, and, just don't feel like doing it.<br />

Just give me a bit of notice cause it takes ages to fly the retriever anywhere.<br />

Security wise we'd most likely want one or two battleships with a fast frigate for takling. Idealy we'd want more miners/haulers. Means people get more minerals that way.</div></div><hr />

Someone may have a bazillion skill points, but they can only have up to skill lvl 5 in something and skill lvl 4 isnt all that much worse.  I have 6 million points in missles, but if I am flying a frigate against you, I am only using a small portion of those total skill points in a fight.  Right now I kind of started training for minny ships, while I am doing that you are catching up to me with your races ships.  Even though you will never have the same total amount of points as me, there is no way you couldn't become just as good of a frig pilot as me in a couple of weeks or in anything else with a bit more time.</div></div><hr />

Don't sell yourself short.  I was in sub .5 space with a frigate.  Sure, you'll lose a ship now and again, but, the cost of a T1 frig is easily made up in .4 space.</div></div><hr />

For instance, when I train my BS skill from 4 to 5 it'll take me 32.5 days.  How many skill points do you think you can catch up in that time?  Also, my next skill will take 21.25 days - how many more points will you make up during that three weeks?</div></div><hr />

A pilot starts comming into his or her own around 10m skill points. You won't be the best, but you'll be effective. Some good gunnery skills, a little bit in navigation and ship command, toss on a webber or a warp scrambler and you're quite the effective support ship.<br />
<br />
Even when doing some NPC hunting in 0.0 a webber is really helpfull. My first jaunt into 0.0 was with a mining corp, and to make some extra cash we would hunt the belt rats. Biggest thing i had with me was a rifter. A good AB and a webber and I was able to slow down damn near anything and allow the people in the battleships to tear it apart. This is an effective tactic in PvP as well. <br />
<br />
Don't give up on the game just yet, keep playing and you'll find your niche yet. There are many career paths that a person can take.</div></div><hr />

If you have a head full of implants you're worried about losing just train it up to 2, fly out to 0.0.  (The ISS station if you aren't part of a 0.0 corp, I *THINK* they allow you to install jumpclones, but its a small fee for docking, so take a shuttle) Install a jump clone, fly back to empire, get all your implants, then jumpclone to 0.0 from whatever station you want to leave your implants in, presto, new body minus implants for pvp.<br />
<br />
For comparison's sake, +3 implants are going for around 20-25 mil a piece right now, in 0.0 you can EASILY make 20 mil an hour by just chaining a good belt spawn or two.  (No Mining required, but it will make you about 2-3x that an hour.)</div></div><hr />

Currently, I've got an Imicus fitted out, but the profit margin seems to be much smaller than agent missions. What's a good next ship? I was thinking of trying to set up an Iteron as a miner, but the single turret slot and no drones makes me cringe at how long it would take. My other thought was to wait it out and get an Exequror, which has lots of turrets and drone space, but a lot less cargo space. Is it feasible for a solo miner to fly a mining barge?

When I outfitted my Iteron I I would keep the market window up for the region and search for various commodities.  If I saw a good sell price and a good buy price, I'd either jettison my cargo (depending on system) or just warp to the selling station, dump it in the hold, and run an actual trade route.  Sure, it was slow, but the rewards were decent.<br />
<br />
Or, if I needed some afk time, I'd just mine in higher sec where I wouldn't be bothered.  It would take me ~half an hour to fill my hold with the skills and equipment I had.</div></div><hr />

Theres also a really good mining guide on the eve-online forums, maybe someone else can link to it, or I'll provide a link when I get home (can't access eve forums from work).<br />

I've probably got a fair few of the tech 1 mining lasers just floating round in one of my fitout hangers, though Miner II's are what you should aim for ideally.  I'll check tonight, anything I have I'm happy to give away to any graffies.<br />

Nanofiber modules add around 10% speed, then there's the medium after burner, and the oldie but goodie microwarp drive  (actually I don't recall if an MWD will fit an Iteron).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mdar</div><div class="date">August 8th, 2006, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">nanos add just a number (10 to 20) to your max speed, not a percent. They also increase your agility (faster to get into warp) but decrease your hull hitpoints.<br />
<br />
As for speed boosts, I think all racial industrial ships get a boost per racial industrial ship level, then there's the navigation skill. As for active mods, you can fit a 1mn Afterburner or a 10mn Afterburner. You can fit a 1mn Microwarp drive which is kind of pointless. For a 10mn MWD you'll need to get your power gride up to 150. This can be reached via the engineering skill and Micro auxillary power cores, provided the grid on an iteron is at 100 before you start tossing on the power cores. (Took me engineering 5 and 4 power cores before I could toss a 10mn MWD on my mammoth, with it on I can't fit any other modules)</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a mining note, the Caldari cruiser is the Osprey.  There's also a mining frigate named Bantam.  Don't forget to train up the Mining skill and Astrogeology, and if you guys are going to be mining together a lot, one of you should train up the Mining Foreman skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
depends 100% on what you're hauling. For a mining op of some kind, then no, a MWD won't allow you to help as much as all expanded cargo holds would, but say for carier missions (higher up ones) than the speed will come in handy.<br />

Minmatar mining ships are the probe and Scythe, same bonuses as the caldari ones</div></div><hr />

but I've come upon a terrible truth. There's nothing to do in this game. I decided I'mn too old to be starting up a corp or guild, and joining other's doesn't seem to be very fun...SO I might be dropping the game after 30 days. <br />
<br />
Again, I see a game with a lot of potential. But no involvement. You farm money. eventually you're segued into ganking people over a starsystem. If all of 0.0 is claimed by alliances already, and the game gets the populace out there, what is the point? What control do we really have? some asteroid belts? (in a month or so some gas clouds?) More farming?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xan</div><div class="date">August 16th, 2006, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres actually a lot to do out in 0.0.  Its even more interesting if you like politics... (No not real politics)<br />
<br />
The thing about 0.0 is you have to be in a good corp.  The people make ALL the difference.  Its kinda like high end raiding in EQ was, some things you do take a lot of time, although in EVE you have much more freedom to join/leave at any time, depending on the scale and range of the op.  There is still a lot of time where you might be just sitting, so having a good group of people to talk to, either in game or on TS can make the difference between being bored for an hour or two waiting for the pretty explosions and fleet battles, or joking around having fun for a few hours, punctuated by a big battle.<br />
<br />
Don't be discouraged about getting bored in empire.  If you aren't interested in mission grinding or the trading system that got massacred by freighters, empire space is pretty dull.  Its fairly easy to break into 0.0 these days, you can find a couple of different alliances that will take newer players.  It will probably still be a few months before you can break into one of the more established alliances, and even then for the first few months you'll be expected to pull your weight, even while you're being treated as a possible spy...  However, once you do get into 0.0 things will get a lot more fun.  Depending on which alliance you join you'll either be part of the clusterfuck of POS Blob Warfare, or smaller skirmishes with the occasional POS dread camp.</div></div><hr />

Okay, well, good rant. BUT, not a reason to stop playing Eve, at least in my opinion. <br />
<br />
Eve, for me, is something I've learned to consume and enjoy on my OWN terms. <br />
<br />
I did the large corp thing. The &quot;politics&quot; things which in many alarming ways resembled alot of what I experienced in EQ raiding and being guilded at the high end(assent\Maelin server). Games become &quot;jobs&quot; when you try to fit into that mold. <br />
<br />
Fortunately in Eve I can get all I need and all that is fun for me in the game without all of &quot;that.&quot;</div></div><hr />

It REALLY sounds like you need to find another hobby besides MMORPGS (Not trying to be an ass here, but we all know these aspects exist EVERYWHERE online).  I'd reccommend finding a few people you can play D&amp;D with, regardless of ruleset, thats really the only place you're going to be able to find the flexibility you want.<br />

Or alternatively, single player games ftw.  No social aspect in those games to worry about.</div></div><hr />

Look up Tundragon, Sniggerdly, Veto, or any other of the top pirate corps. From what I know, they provide a decent social atomsphere within the &quot;piratey&quot; ranks of the game. All the above have very solid pvp reps. <br />
<br />
OR, find yourself a pocket of low sec space in Empire where the &quot;antipirates&quot; are supposedly in control. Then see how fast or adventureously you can get to -10 :) I did that a couple months ago in the Tash Murkon low sec area. Was a blast and never boring. Definitely was a diversion!</div></div><hr />

Oh ok. that clarifies. Then you and I are roughly in the same boat in that regard. When that prick Cyvok looked the other way and did nothing when one of my pilots(EDF at the time, pvp director) got podded by a fellow alliance member, and I took exception that, I decided enough was enough and I told him there's no way in hell I was going to offer my personal dread for alliance ops(this didn't go over well with him hehe). So I ended up leaving, disgusted with the whole &quot;alliance political thing.&quot; Since that day I've been on the pirate thang and not really looked back. <br />
<br />
Eve is still social for me in that I often strike conversations with my victims /cackle :) <br />
<br />
Oh and something else, other posters here are on to something when they mention finding another hobby etc. It NEVER hurts to diversify the things you do with your free time. I play Eve mostly but also significant amount of time in EQ2, EQ1, WoW, and even a little CoH. <br />
<br />
At any rate, good luck with whatever you do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before I took a nap this afternoon (work nights), I reviewed some of my inventory and noted duplicates of items I could not use again.  Looking at the market, I noticed there were numerous copies for sale but no buyers.  So on a whim, I calculated what twenty percent off would cost and set the items at that price.  I set the market time to be three months and figured I would deal with disposition of unsold items at that time.  Since I would have had a skill complete tonight while at work, before leaving, I went to change the skill to keep the points rolling.  I noticed my wallet was not illuminated but opened it anyway ...<br />
<br />
...all my items were sold!<br />
<br />
Now I am contemplating being a combat trader *thinks*.  I'll have to do a bit of research to see how viable this route would be for long term profits.</div></div><hr />

The Forge region seems equivalent to the Caldarian newbie area so probably many players just sell off their goods without much thought.  Currently I am stationed (with my pack rat of odds and ends) one system away in the Lonetek region with potential to reach The Citadel region within a handful of jumps.  So comparison selling is an option for me.  I guess the old EverQuest bazaar mule bug still bites at me...<br />

On a different note, did CCP intentionally have numerous stations positioned with their hangars on the opposite side of warp paths to star gates so autopilot bounces across the station?  Flying the ship on manual with burners just to get clearance is a tad annoying, especially when one needs to quickly get somewhere.<br />
<br />
Another newbie question - during some agent missions, I am instructed to destroy a warehouse to obtain some sealed cargo containers.  I have noticed that if I destroy the habitation area and landing pad, I will obtain ammo, cruise missiles, livestock, and other odds and ends.  Does anyone know or is there a listing of what can be destroyed for goodies?  I have seen elevators, radio towers, ship yards, walls, etc. as floating items with &quot;Wanted&quot; labels but unsure if ~wasting~ my ammo will result in some &quot;phat lewt&quot;. :D <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Jita is the EVE equivalent of Greater Faydark / East Commonlands (depending on your EQ sever). It is high security with a plethora of stations and services, and borders two other regions (Citadel and Lonetrek).<br />

There are players who make a living buying up underpriced items (which 20% off the current lowest, or even the market average, would certainly be) and reselling them. If you're not strapped for cash, it certainly is the best way to get your orders sold ASAP, but such large discounts are going to really add up in the long run.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been encountering this more as well, but I think I have a workaround.<br />
<br />
I noticed that when you first exit the hanger your speed is about 500ish.  If you immedietly initiate warp your ship starts to turn at 500m/s which means it has to make a really wide circle (especially if you're in an industrial ship)- and thats when it runs into the station.  <br />
But if I wait until the ship naturally slows to its normal top speed (takes about 10 seconds or so), then turn on the autopilot it makes the turn much faster and can get up to top speed before it gets back close enough to the station to be unable to warp straight through.- Works with a full Iteron IV anyway and they're hardly graceful.<br />
<br />
The other workaround is to immedietly try to make a turn at 90 degrees to your direction when you exit the hanger.  This can (in some stations) boost your speed up to about 1500 or more, that will boost you far enough away from the station to turn on warp drive in just a few seconds.<br />
<br />
So, what I do is look If the Price is worse then -30% of the Regional Average I just reprocess it, and sell the Materials then.<br />
<br />
<br />
100% refines for the win.  Anything thats not named (and that I don't want to transfer to my fittings hanger) gets broken down into minerals. :) <br />
<br />
And bah humbug, once again Macro Miners have moved into my mining system so I have to find yet another one.  11 ore fields in this .5 system and nothing left but Velspar &amp; some Scordite.  I'm thinking I might have to move down into unsafe .4 and below space.  Seem to be quite a few uninhabited .2 systems but I doubt I could beat the rats with the drones on my mining barge.</div></div><hr />

I would be pretty keen to do that Pilsain.  But its probably worth waiting another couple of weeks until I finish training for a Coverter, better money that way.<br />
Are any other graffies keen on joining us?  As I'm playing from NZ (usual hours are eve gametime 0700-1100/downtime) it would probably be something best done on a Friday or Saturday night US time.

In september sometime (Possibly early) there will be a new BC released for the gallente that will be a drone ship.  So, either wait a while, or jump into a dominix.  They are relatively cheap, only 60 mil, and are perfect for you.</div></div><hr />

Only if they know you're ganged with their war target. Not sure if a gang member shows up as shootible to them though. Also, you can display Corp and Alliance tickers in the over view, I did this with my alt so that I would know if their were hostiles close by.</div></div><hr />

As for server stability, I attempted to play this past Sunday afternoon.  The lag was pretty harsh - causing me to have numerous instances where my ship was back in space while the screen claimed to be leaving the dock while parts of the station sprinkled my view.  Combat was rough with clicking to fire a weapon resulted in a 50/50 chance the weapon was off since everything kept falling out of synch.  Meanwhile, the pirates contined to blast my ship apart...</div></div><hr />

The lag was pretty bearable - a slight delay between clicking the weapon button and the weapon engaging the target.  Opening cargo containers and dragging the spoils of war took a bit longer than usual, but nothing ground breaking.  No queue lines to use a jump gate or to get into a station.  Only once did I have a black screen upon leaving a station - yet I have had this when the number of online players was half the size.  I am not sure whether it is my Nvidia 5600 Ultra blah blah locking up or something upon their end.  Relogging into the game clears it right up (while my ship drifts across space).<br />
<br />
Actually, I remember seeing a first for me during this time.  I was approaching a gate and from the corner of my eye I saw a flash before another player's ship began warping right in front of me.  If the game had unbelievable collision detection, then the front of my ship would have been torn off.  But the most I received was a tad crispy windshield wipers.<br />

<br />
<br />
I had some fairly ambitious plans laid out(ie, moving my corp from catch to Stain) before the cov ops bug, in particular, surfaced. All that was placed on hold as I could not afford to lose even a single cov ops given the price of cov ops II cloaks. <br />
<br />
I guess overall I just dont think CCP is &quot;scaling&quot; well with the increased server population. Things like BM generated lag, lack of tech2 bpos to cover the increased server population, etc, just seems to evade CCP right now. <br />
<br />
They think because 20 tech 2 bpos for each item covered things when the population was 15k simultaneous on tranq, that it will suffice for 30k population. Common sense dictates that something has to give. They need to release more BPOs for tech 2 items, acrossed the board. Also, they need to open up new space NOW, not waiting until Kali comes out. <br />
<br />
In short, Eve is expanding in terms of player, but CCP isn't following suite with respect to game universe or game mechanics.</div></div><hr />

Recent goings on, like ERA backing out of Cache and basicly handing it back to the russians - after we've taken it from them no less than three times - has embolded the reds to try and take more systems, most recently systems belonging to the Coalition member alliance, Knights of the Southern Cross.

Lately, my schedule has been pretty hectic so fragging rats has been far and few between sessions.  So I've taken the route of (potentially long term) maximum benefit and been increasing my learning skills.  To break the monotony, whenever I do play, I change to a different skill and see small increases here and there.  I have a good many books to begin training once I gain a larger amount of time to play.  As of this writing, I am under 150,000 skill points away from the two million mark.<br />
<br />
I still have not decided what &quot;career&quot; path I wish to take in the game.  So many options with so many potential positives (and negatives).<br />
<br />
But I have been doing a lot of forum reading about deep space combat, the markets, tactics, etc., etc.  There are a few things I have a vague idea what is being discussed, but if someone could clarify, then I would appreciate it:<br />
<br />
- The blob (or blobbing) tactic or exploit.<br />
- Stabbing your opponent (isn't that against the law???  :p )<br />
- Modules and ships under the tech level 2 seem to be far and few between releases while discussion about tech level 3 ships...?<br />
<br />
On a different note, to show my Eve support, the avatar is me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ventilee</div><div class="date">September 10th, 2006, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">- The blob (or blobbing) tactic or exploit.<br />
<br />
A blob is generally a gang of 20+ people, I'd say 40 is the average,  consisting of mostly battleships and some support(Frigs, Interceptors, Interdictors, cruisers etc.).  Blob warfare involves two blobs warping in on each other, and proceeding to shoot the living hell out of each other until one side is either out of ships or runs away.  As fun as this sounds blob warfare is actually pretty boring, most of the time is spent waiting, and some nights nothing actually happens.  When blobs do engage, there is generally one guy on each side calling Primary target, which is the guy that everybody shoots until he either warps or blows up.  <br />
<br />
<br />
- Stabbing your opponent (isn't that against the law???  :p )<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you're referring to Warp Core Stabilisers(sp?), which are referred to as Stabs in the EvE community.  Stabs increase your warp core strength, by one point per stab, so that it takes more jamming points to prevent you from warping.  This has traditionally been a point of conflict among the EvE Community, because some people hate them, and others love them.  While it's sometimes lame to have your prey slip away, they're also useful because you can escape some hairy situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Modules and ships under the tech level 2 seem to be far and few between releases while discussion about tech level 3 ships...?<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, this is a complicated thing to answer/clarify.  In EvE there are two tech levels.  Tech1 gear is the most common as the BPO's can be bought straight from the market, the plus side is that it's dirt cheap, but in EvE you generally get what you pay for, tjhese mods/ships are the most basic in the game.  Tech2 items are more expensive for a few reasons, first and most importantly, Tech2 BPO's are incredibly hard to obtain, second they require things that can only be obtained from a POS to create. However, Tech2 items are usually worth it, they can give you a huge advantage no matter what you're doing.  Also, there are named mods, these are considered Tech1, but are better than their actual Tech1 Counterparts.  Depending on the mod they can be only a minor upgrade, to rivalling Tech2 items in power.<br />
<br />
The tier system is really different.  For example: an osprey, Caracal, Moa, Eagle, and Cerberus are four Caldari cruiser class ships.  And Osprey is a Tech1 Tier1 ship because it only requires Caldari Cruiser 1 to fly, while a Caracal is a Tier2 Tech1 Cruiser because it requires Caldari Cruiser 2 to fly, whereas a Moa is a Tier3 Tech1 Cruiser because you need Caladari Cruiser 3 to fly.  IMO a Moa and a Caracal are on the same footing when it comes to power, but that's because I'm a missile whore.  It should be mentioned that Tier3 ships take more minerals to make, therefore making them more expensive than a Tier2 or Tier1 ship.   The Cerberus and Eagle however, are extremely powerful ships because they're Tech2 ships.  A Cerb is a Tech2 Caracal while an Eagle is a Tech2 Moa, these are technically called Heavy Assault Cruisers, or HAC's and, depending on the situation, can destroy Battleships.<br />
<br />
Tiers are a complicated thing to explain, because some ship classes have 3 tiers(cruisers, frigs) some have 2(Battleships), and some have only one tier(HAC's come to mind).<br />
<br />
Hope that helped.</div></div><hr />

I tend to do the same thing.  While I'm flying, I have a long skill set to train, because I don't always have the time (or energy) to log into Eve in my hotel rooms.

<br />
I slipped a number of my chars into their positions in Stain without incident. I'm closer to getting two of my three carrier pilots to jump drive 5 and from there the short bump to jump calibration 4 that will enhance their jump range alot and will be integral to facilitating what I plan to do in Stain.<br />
<br />
I've begun a large reskilling process for a number of my alts that really needed a good role to play in all of this. I've learned that you NEVER can have too many scout alts or cov ops alts and certainly more cynosural capable alts are better! <br />
<br />
I had some interesting encounters on my travels this weekend through catch and into Stain through the HED corridor. A fight between a AXE megathron and my Nightmare that was a stalemate only because the guy wisely had four light ECM drones. But a lesson was learned and I added training for those drones to several of my characters along with purchasing some decently reseach bpcs of a few of the ecm drone types. <br />
<br />
In another encounter with a hostile near DSS in Stain I had an interdictor engage my Nightmare BS. Pretty ballsy on his part I must say. He was about to pop just as he warped away. But interdictors really complicate movement in 0,0. You always have to probe out their movements if you pass one or your scout comes into contact with one.  I was always wondering where that guys backup might be. A jump back? Two jumps back, or a few jumps ahead of me? <br />
<br />
I guess all of this shows that in Eve you are the maker of your misery or success. You just have to accept that there will be problems with game mechanics, lag, overpowered ships, etc. And then ADAPT and overcome those issues is the key to continuing to enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />

ZZMy computer died around 3 weeks ago and I just got my new one up and running Friday.  I dont have an evemail in my box from you!  As far as where in Eve, I went back to empire with Rayst, Mavric, Lokes and Drac.  We're running missions and building ships at the moment.</div></div><hr />

they upped the capacitor on them subtantially. They used to be kinda crappy in that regard and you wondered, &quot;what the hell am I gonna do with 13k armor and no cap to armor tank?&quot; <br />
<br />
But now, with near perfect cap skills, I get a shade under 5800 to 5900 cap if memory serves. I sunk another 1.5 bil into fitting for the ship and end up with resists that are low 80's except for thermal which is about 75ish. <br />
<br />
I had a megathron chewing on me as mentioned in the above post for about 2 to 3 minutes and I still had 40% armor left. After a three or four rep cycles I was full armor, had expended exactly 2 800 charges and was at 80% capacitor. Literally, the only thing that saved the guy's blasterthron was his light ecm drones. But the nightmare just tanks like a beast. Of all the faction ships I own or have owned(which includes, cnr, navy mega, and a rattlesnake), it still tanks the best. <br />
<br />
It's not invincible. Get two or three curses with those noss bonuses and things would get ugly within a couple mins. OFc, those elite cruisers are hopelessly overpwered  atm. <br />
<br />
It's light on dps with four cruise missile launchers and four heavy diminishing nosses loaded in highs. I never solo with it however(unless traveling), so dps from the cruises is always augmented by a full compliment of fighters from a carrier.</div></div><hr />

The jumpdrive story didn't happen, its just a little flavor.<br />
<br />
If you go back a few entries you'll see the Gallente Mothership Hijacking attempt.  This actually was played out, with some Aurora (EVE Event Team people) playing the various characters, and then the Capsule Pilots (Us) intervening and taking part in the event.  Capsule pilots can generally choose sides, whether they want to side with the pirates or the empire.  If you read back through some of the event archives you'll see that events have gone both ways.</div></div><hr />

I would tell you what it's like to lose a Rattlesnake for example(I have sadly), but my therapist tells me not to recount it as a part of my ongoing therapy! The point being, there are always someone else or some group that, properly constituted, can make even a juggernaut like my Nightmare go SPLAT in a couple mins time or less! It's a frightening reality with this MMO.</div></div><hr />

This might sound strange but, I feel safest in terms of 0,0 travel when I'm in a nano'd rifter with an mwd --with or without instas, doesn't matter. Plus, it's gonna be a relatively quick trip versus say moving a BS w/o bm's.</div></div><hr />

Some asshat two boxing wanna be pirate in a command ship and a caldari navy raven ganked my little vengence out from under me in Corvyn this morning.  His l33t method of attack?  WTFpwn the little ship, take damage from my group - stop attacking on one account so he can eventually redock (he was sitting in dock range of a station the entire time - and then dock that ship, repair it, undock begin attacking with that one whilst docking the other one, repairing it and on and on.  <br />
<br />
And of course he's smaking about how LV sucks LOL.  Who can compete with the repair capabilites of a space station?!  I felt sorry for this guy though.  His sec status was so low that he can't leave his little .4 system, he's probably too chicken shit to roam around more than a few jumps from there where are the three of us were up in Syndicate all the way from Teneferis.  <br />
<br />
We went up there in search of war targets though, and war targets we found.  Lots and lots of fat juicy goonies to squish.<br />

On jumpdrives, there is lots of chatter about CCP adding jumpdrive capability to freighters.  One can only pray they'll do this.  It's sort of silly to have a capitol ship without a jump drive and why use a freighter when you can just jump your stuff back and forth in a carrier?<br />
<br />
Donis - I could have sworn I answered your last evemail asking you if you were going to join Shinra.  We've gotten brunchpilot and a few other TCT instantly approved into Shinra.  I think pretty much everyone was pissed at what Tatz did, what a fucking petulant child.  SO are you going to rejoin LV?  Shinra?  <br />
<br />
Goa, <br />

I still lack the caldari battleship skill to fly that thing, and it would most certainly be lost probably too easily which is why I hesitate to buy it.  I still can't use large tech 2 beams,  so I will probably train that after I get Zed into interceptors in another 4 days.<br />

Some events are real.  My corp / alliance got to ally themselves with one of the NPC pirate groups (I forget which ones) and helped escort them somewhere.  Someone in my corp helped escort a Titan during some even (not an actual Titan, but one they event staff had or something).<br />
<br />
Speaking of titans, I'm curious to see who'll show their's first.... :)<br />

ORLY? /jizz Seriously though, this would revolutionize my capability level in Stain with my &quot;little project&quot; vs. ASCN. I currently have the logistics ironed out according to Carrier transport capacity and whereas my 2nd alt that is in an archon and started jump drive calibration this morning after finishing the LONG LONG haul through jump drive 5 this past month. <br />
<br />
I'm brimming with excitment now that I know within a couple days I'll have two carriers capable of 1 jumping from Empire to Stain. A Third carrier pilot in a thanatos is 10 days away from Jump drive calibration. Soon the fun begins for real! <br />

<br />
Donis, LV are a very capable crew. Nice guys as well. I can somewhat vouch as I was in Adeptus Gatticus for about a month and although that didn't end up being my cup of tea due more towards the fact that LV space was so seemingly tightly locked down and that was a problem for someone like me who really enjoyed doing the &quot;local defense thing&quot; versus going to sit at a gatecamp in a system that alliance was trying to lock down from RA or someone. Point being, of all the alliances I know of, they are in the short list of being most player friendly. <br />

The alt of mine who flies the Nightmare is uniquely situated with both Amar BS 5 and Cald BS 5 with 6 to 7 million SP in missiles as well(34mil SP in total). Similar to you he doesn't use tech 2 beams or pulses BUT I wouldn't equip those anyway as lasers aren't atop my list of favorite weapons because they consume precious cap needed for tanking.</div></div><hr />

Yes, do the tutorial, you'll thank us later and zomgz NO don't shoot a station.  haha.  Ya'll are veteran MMO players, but please PLEASE do not get discouraged in a day or a week because you're not experiencing the &quot;end game&quot;.  Give Eve time.  Take it from someone that's put the game down like 3 times, it will get boring or rather, lonely.  And again I say, every single one of you that is not involed with the Southern Coalition and thus a war target - needs to be grouping with other graffe pilots.  You cannot play this game alone, don't even thing of trying it.  Oh sure, you can run missions for awhile, or run cargo, or even run illegal cargo if you have a death wish - but this game is meant to be explored with friends, and the only way you'll survive it is with friends.  Please please PLEASE make arrangments to meet each other in a common location, and start ganging together.  Find some belt rats and wtfpwn them.  Mine together, run missions together etc etc.<br />

That was probably a freighter pilot, buying what seems like mudane items en mass for a lower price than what he can fetch in another region is a pretty common practice.  People do that with minerals, items and even ships I think.<br />

EVE doesn't so much have a difficulty curve as a difficulty cliff. Once you reach the top, it's all good. :D</div></div><hr />

Do not expect to achieve fame and fortune from the get-go is also a good mentality to follow.  Personally you might reach a plateau of accomplishment - but somewhere out there is another player aligning you within their crosshairs to bring you down again.  Thus nobody is &quot;safe&quot; at being at the top.  Add the numerous layers of gaming - from corporations backstabbing each other to a waning and waxing market to research, mining, and other &quot;trades&quot; interacting among itself and other aspects, Eve is not a game for those seeking instant gratification.  The moment you think you can hit the &quot;I WIN&quot; button is the day you find yourself podded in deep space.</div></div><hr />

With the state of macro mining as it is we'd really need to try and hit a system right after it respawns as well.  So far the best I've found is one respawning after Fridays downtime (which excludes our US players I think) but I'll keep looking, and if anyone else keen can keep on the lookout as well that would be great.  Although, running it Friday evening (US time) could be doable as well as it probably won't be too mined out.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, the game crashed right between the end of the first half and start of the second half of the in tutorial agent mission (not sure if every race gets the same thing, so the Minmitar side of things), and now I can't get back the mission to drop the encryption book off with the second agent. Is there any way to get it back, or am I just SOL?</div></div><hr />

It was SO cool to see Tz, Rooster and the gang in game tonight!  In time, it's comes.  Yes it's like a cliff, suddenly you find yourself falling over the edge, either because you jumped (pun!) over, was pushed, or dragged into some loony situation. :)<br />

Do not expect to achieve fame and fortune from the get-go is also a good mentality to follow. Personally you might reach a plateau of accomplishment - but somewhere out there is another player aligning you within their crosshairs to bring you down again. Thus nobody is &quot;safe&quot; at being at the top. Add the numerous layers of gaming - from corporations backstabbing each other to a waning and waxing market to research, mining, and other &quot;trades&quot; interacting among itself and other aspects, Eve is not a game for those seeking instant gratification. The moment you think you can hit the &quot;I WIN&quot; button is the day you find yourself podded in deep space.<br />

This game is intriguing me, but with my EXTREMELY limited play time I'm not sure if I want to get started.  But if I can go 'train' somethign when I can't log in for a week at a time, and make some kind of progress even if I'm not logged in, that'd be awesome.</div></div><hr />

So I warp in, do the dirty deed, send him a convo, he accepts I ask 6m for the ship, and he says hang on a sec.  So I wait like a minute and then his buddy warps in and they procede to kill me.<br />

Track him down with locator agent, destroy his ship, and then his pod. :D</div></div><hr />

You get pirated? Or have bad luck against a npc ship?</div></div><hr />

You can set a skill to train and log off and the skill points continue to accrue. <br />

When I started Eve I did not really understand this and as such I left my computer on and logged into the game all night with the eery Eve space music playing in the computer room. My wife was kinda freaked out in the morning as she gets up much earlier than I do.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I've played sparesely because of RL issues during the last three weeks, yet all my toons have made tremendous progress in training skillpoints. In fact, being able to focus on skill retooling when you really can't do much in game is actually good practice every now and then to keep your characters current on their list of skills to train.</div></div><hr />

Example, I could get some lvl1-2 skills while I'm playing for the few minutes/hour I have on average a week, but could log out working on a lvl3 and have that started/mostly finished by the next time I logged in?</div></div><hr />

Skill training has no connection to being logged in. A skill gains points based on it's primary and secondary attribute and a Real World clock. Being logged in does nothing, except of course you cannot change skills when logged out.</div></div><hr />

I figured it was doing something in game, but I've seen a few people mention that it was a patch day so make sure to set a skill point that's long to learn? What they mean is that beacuse it is a patch day and you can not log in to switch to a new skill if you finish your current skill you want to make sure you pick a skill that got a long time left. This due to the fact that the skill points are added to your character only until the current skill is complete and after that will not add up until you pick a new skill to train.</div></div><hr />

You can spend a day or two doing it.  You can easily finish the tutorial in one sitting though.  I'd say the tutorial is enough to get you out of the door, but it's about 1% of the info you'll want.  Not that it's not a good 1% to have, it's just that EVE is so frigging VAST that it takes time to master.<br />
<br />
I'd be up for a mining op.  Mods, GIV EVE FORUM!</div></div><hr />
