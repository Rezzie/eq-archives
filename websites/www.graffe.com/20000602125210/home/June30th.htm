          Bonds of Force has been uploaded to all servers and is available for 
          purchase at your Guild Hall. Seems to be the Wizards spell for 'Ensnare'. 
          This will slow your enemies to a walk when casted upon. Finally something 
          for us that we can use!</p>

        Well, for those of you that didn't take notice earlier today, I've once 
        again maxed my bandwidth and hits. With over a total of 125,000 page hits 
        in the last 24 hours (don't you think somebody would want to sponsor me? 
        hehe) .. my web host had to put pipe clamp on me once again. I finally 
        bit the bullet and purchased myself a dedicated server on a better host 
        (I hope.. grass is always greener on the other side) and will soon be 
        moving. Also, the URL will soon be shortened. =)</p>
      <p>Enderlin Anklebiter sent in the current info on the new spell Bonds of 
        Force:<br>
        Level 29 Area Effect<br>
        75 mana to cast</p>
      <p>Hoping somebody took a pic of the stats while on the vendor (or bought 
        it) and can tell us exactly what it does. From the name, it does sound 
        like either an Area Root or an Area Root with damage. Any info would be 
        most appreciated. <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">Send</a> it in!</p>

          Endymion Lunarmyst of Xegony also sent in word that the Research spell, 
          Energy Storm is researchable. Apparently there is two Runes of Fulguration 
          floating around (nice job Verant). One is for the level 16 spell, Project 
          Lightning and the other is for the level 29 spell, Energy Storm. Visit

          damage and mana ratings for level 24 and 29. With this new info, I have 
          been thinking of a new format for the spells page that will include

          This is the start of the sites color change. Hope this makes it a bit 
          easier to read for you guys. Out of everybody, I received two <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">emails</a> 
          from people that had troubles reading the way it was before... and that 
          is two too many. I want to make this site enjoyable and user friendly 
          for everybody. So if you have a problem with it, let me know. Also, 
          in the table of contents to the left, I switched the rollover image 
          color to match this text. That should also make it a bit easier for 
          you to navigate. For an explanation of the old color scheme: I am a 
          Dark Elf and was going for a 'dark' feel. Well, I got it... not knowing 
          that the site would get this much traffic, I continued to add pages 
          in the same format. So, out with the old and in with the new. Enjoy... 
          the rest of the site will soon match. (just have to pry myself from 
          Norrath). <br>

          I am trying to contact them to find out if it is maintenance or if someone

          Duran DiNova emailed me this bit of news that most of you will find 
          interesting:</p>
        <p><br>
          A deed has been commited, a horrible deed. You know they happen often, 
          but this one finally stuck to you, but you cannot explain why. You take 
          a walk to clear your head and relieve some of the tension you feel gripping 
          you. As you are walking, you find yourself lost, you don't know how 
          you could have ended up lost in an area you grew up in. It grows dark. 
          You stop, in the distance, a figure is walking towards you, it is soon 
          standing before you, but you cannot make out the face. Then it speaks... 
          "The paladins fell, the heros grow corrupt, the you? Ways that led back 
          to the same. You have been blinded as to what is the truth, you knew 
          that all your life? But now a choice has been given to you. Begin on 
          the path of the true understanding now, the understanding you have been 
          trying to find. Are you of the Silence?" The Order of the Silence is 
          a Solusek Ro worshiping guild getting ready for the racewar server. 
          This means that only wizards and Bards will be allowed within it's ranks. 
          We are focused greatly on RP and on creating an RP enviroment on the 
          Racewar server. Since this is a Wizard board, please give this guild 
          your consideration. We all know the power of a Wiz, but we all know 
          the hardships which we must go through in order to gain that power. 
          This guild plans on helping it's members in all cases, especially with 
          solving disputes. Our guild will back up our members in all cases. Many 
          of you that have played this game for a while (myself since beta) may 
          have found that a non-pvp enviroment can be boring and unrealistic, 
          not to mention extremely under-roleplayed. We believe that the racewar 
          server will solve this problem.</p>
        <p>Please contact me on ICQ - 23126662 <br>
          or through e-mail - <a href="mailto:mordere@gateway.net">mordere@gateway.net</a>
