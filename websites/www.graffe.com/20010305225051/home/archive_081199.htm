          Had a couple emails and I saw some discussion about the Glowing Stein/Stein 

          of Moggok. Just to clear things up, when the Glowing Stein is changed 

          into the Stein of Moggok, it does keep all of its attributes (Dex, Int, 

          HP, Disease) as well as being a 1H Blunt Weapon.</p>

        <p>I had a small FTP error take place while uploading some submits from 

          home to my server at work, so with today's item additions I was not 

          able to include the 'submitted by' info. I will correct this when I 

          return home this evening. I have only done two additions to the site 

          this morning but more are to come as soon as I get the jaz drive installed 

          on the NT box here at work. (..... thinking of a good excuse as to why 

          work needs one.....backup!.. heh).</p>

          <font color="#FFFFFF">Glowing Stein Report</font>: Received an email 

          with the stats upon the renamed stein. I decided to log onto the test 

          server to verify the email. The Glowing Stein, now known as the Stein 

          of Moggok, is now a 1H Blunt weapon with a Damage of 7 and a Delay of 

          43. I will try my hardest to find out when the patch will take place 

          upon the main servers so that we don't loose our other held items. Thanks 

          to the viewer that emailed the info and thanks to Tonia Drachenfeuer

          Looks like as of last night, both the Glowing Stein and the Cuburt Quests 

          are fine. I have not had a chance to log in for myself to see if there 

          was a patch last night. I will wait for viewer email concerning the 

          status of the Glowing Stein quest today.</p>

        <p>On a side note, a few months back I recieved an email stating that 

          the Flowing Black Robe had been found within Runnyeye from a viewer. 

          This person has been getting flooded with in game tells concerning it. 

          His name has been removed from the info due to the fact that he just 

          emailed me stating that he never did send such info. So, if you have 

          his name written down... stop pestering the poor guy. The Runnyeye info 

          is false.</p>

          Receiving many reports that the Bartender is still in Freeport upon 

          many servers. We shall see what happens tomorrow morning. As for Cuburt, 

          seems that this is an isolated problem on Cazic-Thule for I have received 

          many reports that the quest is working on other servers.</p>

          Got word from Manan Faren D'Oloth of Cazic-Thule that the Glowing Stein 

          Quest <i>may</i> have already been pulled from his server (Verant removed 

          the Bartender in Freeport). He also included that upon his server nothing 

          is spawning at the Cuburt spawn point in the Qeynos Aqueducts. Any confirmation 

          about these two matters would be helpful. Feel free to <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">email</a> 

          me. Thank you Manan!

        <p> - 11:30am PST<br>

          Recieving alot of emails asking my further thoughts upon Asheron's Call. 

          I posted this to the General Message Board a couple days ago and I'll 

          post it here so you can read.</p>

        <p>&quot;What I found to be the greatest aspect of being a caster in AC 

          was the thinking that went along with getting your spells. You dont 

          need to goto your vendor and buy the spell.. you go get components (much 

          like the research practice in EQ.. yet in AC they are purchasable from 

          the magic vendors), once you get the components you can create your 

          spells if you know the right ingredients and order they go in. Now.. 

          in game right now, the higher level players are not telling their ingredients 

          unless you trade for info.. but you know what, Jodowein (this was a 

          person that I posted under) is right.. there will be sites that will 

          list this info quickly. Then again, I have also been told that what 

          works for one mage may not work for another.. so that spells will be 

          totally user specific. (Kinda nice to see a spell that only you can 

          cast). </p>

        <p>As for the Graphics.. not that great at all. But also keep in mind 

          that this is a BETA. In most betas, the graphic enhancements come last. 

          So from the way it is now, I have a feeling that it may have the ability 

          to surpass EQ.. even with their lame D3D. (This may be rivaled again 

          when the expansion for EQ comes out and we all get more polygons... 

          just wait to see). </p>

        <p>The best thing I noticed.. NO ZONES. You computer 'reads ahead' for 

          the landscape and loads them as you run. The more you play, the faster 

          the game will become due to it caching all of the graphics. The closest 

          thing to a zone is called a 'portal'. The neat thing about portals is 

          that you can still chat while in one.. you don't sit there with your 

          computer locked up wondering if you are going to be looking at your 

          login screen or desktop anytime soon. =) </p>

        <p>All in all, the game has great promise. For a game slated to be released 

          in December.. they have quite a in depth game in their hands. Who wouldn't 

          with the financial backing of Microsoft capital. So my final note is.. 

          don't sweat trying to get into AC, If EQ would focus on quests, like 

          the name suggests, they would have no worry about people defecting. 

          Damn I hope a developer at Verant reads that.&quot;</p>

        <p>Now for some additional thoughts. When I beta tested for Everquest, 

          I was simply blown away. Graphics, user interface, size of the world, 

          etc., all amazed me. When I fired up Asheron's Call for the first time, 

          I did not have that feeling that Everquest gave me. Everquest still 

          has the ability to pull me in and make me feel like I am actually within 

          the world... this is something Asheron's Call did not do for me. Keep 

          in mind this is just my opinion and many others out there may feel different. 

          Don't judge the game just from my point of view, wait until you can 

          play it for yourself before making a decision. -<a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">

          quest had already emailed it to me in great detail. I opted to use my

          Well.. headed to off to get some shuteye for the night. Spent my evening 

          and morning playing Asheron's Call. Don't worry.. I'm not going anywhere. 

          I love Everquest and I enjoy keeping this site. But I must say that 

          the research of spells in Asheron's Call is simply incredible. Thanks 

          to a good friend from EQ named Cypren, he helped coach me thru the beginnings 

          of my teachings. I took a <a href="../screenpics/GraffeAC.jpg" target="_blank">pic</a>

          It is not from the Plane of Fear. It is quite easy to acquire by completing
