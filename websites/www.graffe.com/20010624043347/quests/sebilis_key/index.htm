      <p>If you are a high level player looking to for adventure in the depths 
        of the dungeon of <a href="../../maps/kunark/sebilis.zip">Sebilis</a>, 
        you will need to do this quest. In order to gain entry into Sebilis, you 
        need a key. In order to obtain that key, you need to complete the following 
        quest.</p>
      <p>This quest starts in <a href="../../maps/kunark/trakanons_teeth.jpg" target="_blank">Trakanon's 
        Teeth</a> with a level 60 Iksar NPC named <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="openPictureWindow_Fever('emperor_ganak.jpg','640','480','Emperor Ganak','100','100')">Emperor 
        Ganak</a> (-3330.00, 2660.00, -370.34) . You can find Ganak within a tomb 
        where the <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="openPictureWindow_Fever('entrance_to_ganak.jpg','640','480','Entrance to Ganak','100','50')">entrance</a> 
        is upon the South wall in the back of the iksar graveyard (-2800.00, 2840.00, 
        -311.00). </p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>You say</b>, 'hail Emperor Ganak'</p>
        <p><b>Emperor Ganak says</b> 'Greetings. It has been long since I was 
          aware on this plane. Who are you and what do you want of me, Ganak, 
          wyrm scourge and slayer of Jaled-Dar? </p>
        <p><b>You say</b>, 'How do I get the key to sebilis?'</p>
        <p><b>Emperor Ganak says</b> 'An adventurer who wishes to enter the inner 
          city of Sebilis, you say?? There are only two ways in, either the [glowing 
          orb] in the heart of the ruins in the outer city, or via one of the 
          tortured souls who wander the jungles nearby.</p>
        <p><b>You say</b>, 'What glowing orb?' </p>
        <p><b>Emperor Ganak says</b> 'The glowing orb is activated by a special 
          key, an idol crafted in the likeness of the dread Trakanon, Reaver of 
          Sebilis. I have this idol and will give it to you, but only if you give 
          me two [medallions] representing the Iksar tribes of old.</p>
        <p><b>You say</b>, 'What medallions?'</p>
        <p><b>Emperor Ganak says</b> 'There were five different tribes of my people. 
          The Kunzar, Kylong, Nathsar, Obulus, and Jarsath. Each of the tribes 
          had a medallion that represented it. If you can return to me the medallions 
          of the Kunzar and Nathsar, I will give you the idol of Trakanon. </p>

      <p>The Froglok Forager (picture needed) drops the <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="openPictureWindow_Fever('medallion_of_the_kunzar.jpg','310','125','Medallion of the Kunzar','250','200')">Medallion 
        of Kunzar</a> and a <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="openPictureWindow_Fever('spectral_bow.jpg','310','125','Spectral Bow','200','150')">Spectral 
        Bow</a>. The Froglok Hunter (picture needed) drops the <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="openPictureWindow_Fever('medallion_of_the_nathsar.jpg','310','125','Medallion of the Nathsar','250','200')">Medallion 
        of Nathsar</a> and a Spectral Bow. You can find both frogs roaming the 
        Northwest area of Trakanon's Teeth (a safe area to wait is +1800, +3600) 
        and it is wise to bring a tracker to find them. Both frogs are level 45, 
        hit for about 117, and they spawn one after the other. The only placeholders 
        they have are named mobs. Be warned, one of the placeholders is a rare, 
        level 55 skeleton named 'Doom' that hits for 200+.</p>
      <p> Once you have both of these medallions, head back to Emporer Ganak. 
        Hand both medallions to him and hit the trade button.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><b>Emperor Ganak says</b> 'You have returned to me two medallions of 
          my people. In return, I give you this key to enter the ruins of Sebilis. 
          Be wary though, for Trakanon, Scourge of the Sebilisian empire, resides 
          within. </p>
        <p>You gain party experience!!</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>You now have in your possession the '<a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="openPictureWindow_Fever('trakanon_idol.jpg','310','125','Trakanon Idol','250','200')">Trakanon 
        Idol</a>'. This idol is actually the key to Sebilis. This idol is now 
        'soulbound' to you. This means that even if you die, you will have it 
        in your inventory so that you may re-enter Sebilis.</p>
