    can be found at the Vasty Deep Inn within Erudin. To find him inside the Inn, 
    open the front door to the Inn and go up the stairs on your right. Follow 
    the hallway around the second floor and Camin is found behind the first door 
    upon your left. Off the bat, he is normally indifferent or apprehensive to 
    everyone. To raise faction, hand him the note that was given to you by Soloman 
    and you will receive the following faction adjustments:</blink></font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font size="2" color="#999999"><blink>TrueSpirit (positive faction)</blink></font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font size="2" color="#999999">Camin will now reply with -</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>Camin says</b>, 'So you have met Solomen, 
      eh? He is a man with a wealth of knowledge. It is good to hear he is well.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" color="#999999">Now hail Camin and he will respond with this 
    -</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>Camin says</b> 'Go away! I have no time 
      for you! </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" color="#999999">If this happens, you need to raise your faction 
    to <i>warmly</i> with him. <blink>Since the patch on 10/03/00, you can no 
    longer keep handing Camin the note and gain faction.. it has been nerfed. 
    If you know of a way to easily raise faction with TrueSpirit, please let me 
    know. If you have an excess of platinum in your pocket, you can try handing 
    Camin the 1000 platinum without your faction being up to par and you might 
    be able to continue with the quest. Some have reported this as working while 
    being apprehensive to him.</blink></font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#999999">Once you are warmly with Camin: 
    </font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>you say</b>, 'What are you searching 
      for?'<b><br>
      Camin says</b> 'Ah! A smart one, I see! If you really wish to know about 
      such a thing, you will have to help me finance my studies. The knowledge 
      I have acquired and researched did not come cheaply.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#999999">At this point, hand Camin 1000 
    platinum pieces. Doing this will make Camin reply with:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>Camin says</b>, 'Good, good, you show 
      a willingness to learn of this with your offer. What I can tell you is that 
      Solusek Ro had four followers who had shown exceptional aptitude in the 
      arts of wizardry. Solusek Ro himself tutored them. He considered them to 
      be like his own children. I know of one who still exists. He goes by the 
      name of Arantir Karondor. He used to specialize in the storing of magic 
      into physical objects. Arantir has been hiding for many, many years and 
      will most assuredly be going by another name, so keep your eyes open. Anyway, 
      be off, I need to continue my research. Return to me if you ever find Arantir 
      Karondor.'</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" color="#999999">Now to find Arantir Karondor. I honestly have 
    no idea what Verant was thinking when they did this part of the quest. There 
    are <i>zero</i> clues as to who or where this person is and honestly, it's 
    sort of disturbing to me that every other class' quest is straightforward, 
    but still has a very good degree of difficulty. None the less, there is a 
    female NPC vendor in Halas named '<a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="openPictureWindow_Fever('dargon.jpg','129','343','Dargon','300','100')">Dargon</a>' 
    that sells a potion called <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="openPictureWindow_Fever('ros_breath.jpg','310','125','Potion','200','200')">Ro's 
    Breath</a>. She is located in front of the Shaman guild. Purchase this potion 
    from Dargon (**evil races be warned - you ARE KOS to surrounding NPC's**) 
    for the sum of about 900pp to 1100pp depending on your faction and charisma.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" color="#999999">Now take this potion back to Camin in Erudin 
    and hand it to him. He will reply with the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>Camin says</b> 'Very interesting... I've 
      seen this work before. Yes, yes! It's the work of Arantir Karondor! Give 
      this back to the person you got it from. Maybe he will have a clue to Arantir's 
      location.' </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" color="#999999">Camin gives you back the potion (it has now 
    been stripped of it's Shield of Lava charge) and you must take it back to 
    Dargon in Halas.<br>
    <i>Note: you cannot skip the previous trip to Camin. You absolutely, must 
    hand the potion to Camin. If you try to skip the trip to Erudin, you will 
    get the following message from Dargon: "I didnt request this item, but thank 
    you very much".</i></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" color="#999999">Back in Halas, hand the Ro's Breath potion 
    back to Dargon. She will turn into blue robe adorned, <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="openPictureWindow_Fever('arantir.jpg','188','460','Arantir Karondor','200','50')">Arantir 
    Karondor</a> and reply with:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>Dargon says</b> 'So, I've been discovered! 
      You must know Camin - he is one of the only people who could have recognized 
      my work. I have worked very hard to mask my presence here.' </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>You say</b>, 'hail Arantir Karondor' 
      <br>
      <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Before I tell you anything, I require you 
      to help me. Seek a woman named Challice. Give her this letter and then return 
      to me.'</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" color="#999999">The letter that Arantir hands you is actually 
    a ring. Identifying it reveals: "Item Lore: My love has no bounds." <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="openPictureWindow_Fever('challice.jpg','175','368','Challice','200','100')">Challice</a> 
    is found in the basement of the Felwithe paladin guild. Hand Challice the 
    ring and she will reply with:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>Challice says</b> 'Oh yes? Arantir? What 
      a fool he was! the man gave me everything, but for all his intelligence, 
      he could never understand why I was truly with him. It was for his power; 
      he could do anything. But when he mysteriously lost it, he became just another 
      toy. I never loved him. Return this ring to him. He will understand that 
      I have no desire to see him again.' </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" color="#999999">This new ring, when indentified reads: "Item 
    Lore: I never could love a man like you." Take this ring back to Arantir and 
    hand it over (WARNING: There are conflicting reports stating that you can 
    or cannot hand the ring to Dargon if Arantir has despawned. Arantir despawns 
    about 3 minutes of speaking to him the first time so you must either be quick, 
    wait for another wizard to make him spawn, or try your luck and hand Dargon 
    the ring). Then you must hail him to get his attention and go through the 
    following dialogue:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>you say</b>, 'Hail Arantir Karondor!'<br>
      <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Ah, but it pains my heart to see this. How 
      I could love a women like that is beyond me. And yet, I still do love her. 
      It was on the day I was to ask her to marry me that I lost my powers. When 
      I was about to cast my greatest spell to prove my love to her, my magic 
      failed. She ran out on me that day. But enough of me, do you wish to hear 
      my story?' </font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>you say</b>, 'I wish to hear your story.'<b><br>
      Arantir Karondor says</b> 'I once was one of four true followers of Solusek 
      Ro. So great were the four of us that Solusek Ro himself made us each a 
      special item. We did not know what the others' items were, but we realized 
      that was for our own safety. Each one of us, after receiving the item, began 
      to plot against Solusek Ro. Each of us believed we had enough power to dominate 
      Norrath. Solusek Ro saw this and at the time we needed our powers most, 
      he stripped us of them. Now I know two of the other wizards by name. One 
      was called Sylen Tyrn, the other's name was Demunir Scry. The last wizard 
      was a gnome, but I can't think of his name.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>you say</b>, 'What about Sylen Tyrn?'<br>
      <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Sylen was a high elf wizard, and like many 
      high elves, he believed himself to be better than others. Because of his 
      birth, he thought he was more noble and more intelligent than anyone else. 
      I heard how met his demise - while flying over a vast area of water, his 
      powers were stripped from him in midflight. He fell and was captured by 
      a rival wizard who specialized in magics of the water. Search for that wizard 
      and you could find a trace of Sylen.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" color="#999999">More than likely, the 'trace' of Sylen Tyrn 
    is found off of Phiningel Autropos deep in Kedge Keep - the <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="openPictureWindow_Fever('../../weapons/2h_blunt/blue_crystal_staff.jpg','310','125','Staff','200','150')">Blue 
    Crystal Staff</a>. When this item is identified, the power of Solusek Ro radiates 
    from within.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>you say</b>, 'What about Demunir Scry?'<br>
      <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Demunir was a human in a rush for power. He 
      was extremely intelligent and resourceful but, unfortunately, was more interested 
      in destructive magic. Hearing of an ancient land, he immediately traveled 
      to it, believing there to be powerful relics left undiscovered there. While 
      exploring, he came upon a dwelling that housed a powerful warrior. Believing 
      himself to be more powerful, he attempted to take this dwelling for himself. 
      While in battle with this warrior, Solusek Ro stole his powers and left 
      him helpless. It is said that Demunir's item is the warrior's most prized 
      trophy.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" color="#999999">The Demunir item is thought to either be the 
    <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="openPictureWindow_Fever('../../weapons/2h_blunt/gnarled_staff.jpg','310','125','Staff','200','150')">Gnarled 
    Staff</a> off of Venril Sathir from within Karnor's Castle or a warrior item 
    found from deep within The Hole.</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>you say</b>, 'Can you tell me about the 
      gnome?'<br>
      <b>Arantir Karondor says</b> 'Ah, the gnome I know very little about. I 
      know he was small and crafty, and that he had a brother. His brother's craft 
      was that of making fireworks, and he was the unfortunate victim of one of 
      his own experiments. His firework exploded, leaving his mind diminished 
      in capacity, even for a gnome. I remember others calling him 'Old Stewpot' 
      in jest. I do not know if this is his birth name, but it may help you to 
      locate him. I hear he also stays close to water because of the explosion. 
      You never know when another gnomish invention will go awry. Give him this 
      letter to help motivate him to remember. </font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" color="#999999">The gnome seems to be <a href="javascript:void(0)" onClick="openPictureWindow_Fever('kandin_firepot.jpg','125','239','Kandin Firepot','200','150')">Kandin 
    Firepot</a>. Kandin can be found in the Southwest region of ButcherBlock Mountains 
    (-1500 +2800) near the ocean. Handing Kandin the note from Arantir results 
    in the following:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2" color="#999999"><b>Kandin Firepot says</b> 'Brother! I have 
      one of those. He's great, but he's dead. His name was Gabstik and he was 
      a really powerful wizard. I still have one of his greatest possessions! 
      Hey, I know! You can help me with my greatest firework! I need you to get 
      me a skin to put the powder from my firework in. That's the only thing I 
      can think of to use though I cannot get myself. I need a skin that is dry 
      and brittle, yet can still be shaped. So go fetch me some and I'll scratch 
      your back.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#999999">The 'skin' Kandin speaks of is 
    'Cazic's Skin' found off of Cazic Thule in the Plane of Fear. When identified, 
    the skin comes up with 'Item Lore: Brittle yet malleable skin.' It looks like 
    a bear skin.</font></p>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" color="#999999">Take this skin back to Kandin 
    and hand it to him. He will reply with:</font></p>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font size="2"><b>Kandin Firepot says</b> 'Great! This is? What is this 
      for again? Oh yeah, the casing for my firework. Here, you can have this 
      then, oh no, wait. You can't yet. I forgot I needed another part to my firework, 
      and you are exactly the person to get it for me! I need some mistletoe powder. 
      Now, go find some for me! Go, go, go, go! Shoo! Oh, wait! Hold on to my 
      bag for me, please. You can give it back after you've given me what I want.</font></p>
