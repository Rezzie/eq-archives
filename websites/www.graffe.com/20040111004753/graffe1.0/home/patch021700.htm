      <p><font size="2">***Announcements*** </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The City of Paineel, home to the infamous Heretics of 
        Erudin, is now available via the Optional Patch. In addition, Erudites 
        may now also be Shadowknights in addition to the other classes available 
        to them. All Erudite Necromancers, Shadowknights, and Clerics who worship 
        the God of Fear, Cazic-Thule, now start in the City of Paineel. As such, 
        if you wish to create a character of this type from this point forward, 
        you *must* download the Paineel zone-files via the Optional Patch. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Please note that if you downloaded the Paineel zone files 
        recently, you must run the Optional Patch again to insure you have the 
        correct version of the files.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">In related news, all of the entrances to the Qeynos Catacombs 
        have been fixed.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Enjoy!</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">***Patch Message***</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The following changes have been implemented on the live 
        servers: </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Spell Changes</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">The recast delay for many of the Shaman buff-spells 
          have been reduced. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">"Reoccurring Amnesia" has had its casting time reduced. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">"Yaulp" and "Augmentation" should now stack. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">"Solidarity of Vision" has had its duration increased. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The Druid spell, "Skin Like Nature", has been returned 
          to its former status due to popular opinion. As such, the damage-shield 
          component has been removed and the regeneration component has been re-applied. 
          </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">"Sense Magic" has been replaced in all cases by the 
          "True North" spell. If you have already inscribed the "Sense Magic" 
          spell, the spell icon will now automatically reflect "True North". </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">A bug that existed with several damage-shield spells, 
          causing their damage to be subtracted rather than added when stacked, 
          has been corrected. The spells will now stack properly. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">The "Feign Death" spell, when cast by a Necromancer, 
          will now have a fixed duration. The Necromancer will receive several 
          warnings prior to the spell wearing off. This change was necessary because 
          some Necromancers found a way to gain experience through their pet while 
          being AFK for an extended duration, such as being in bed for the night. 
          Note: This does not affect Shadowknights or Monks. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">New Necromancer spells are now in game. Check your 
          spell vendors. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Alchemy has been revamped. Check with your local Shaman. 
          - DOT (Damage Over Time) spells will no longer hinder camping.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2"><b>General Changes/Fixes</b></font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">The dungeon of Paw has again received a minor update 
          to slightly reduce the difficulty of the zone. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">All known issues with the SBLive soundcard have been 
          corrected. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2"> From this point forward, deleting a character will 
          cause all corpses belonging to that character to likewise be deleted. 
          This change was made primarily to stop a no-drop transfer bug. It also 
          has the added effect of cleaning up corpses for characters that people 
          no longer intend to play. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Crippling Blows will now display the correct damage 
          in the "You have scored a Crippling Blow (###)" line.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Corpse Looting Exploit</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Recently, an exploit was discovered that allowed certain 
        unsavory individuals to loot the corpses of other players without their 
        consent. The precise symptom of this is that the owner would find their 
        corpse stripped of everything except for no-drop items, and items in a 
        bag with no-drop items. This exploit was fixed in this patch.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">If you were affected by this exploit recently, you are 
        entitled to a reimbursement of your lost items assuming that we still 
        have a record of what you had. Please contact a GM in-game to arrange 
        for an investigation. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2">During the course of the investigation, people who have 
        exploited this bug will be subject to disciplinary action by our GM staff 
        up to and including item wipes, suspension, and/or banishment. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Rogue Enhancements</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Rogues received several enhancements as part of this patch: 
        </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">The chance to score a critical hit with a throwing 
          weapon has been increased significantly. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">When throwing a weapon from behind the NPC in question, 
          a rogue now has a chance to score a "Deadly Strike", for enhanced damage 
          above and beyond that of a critical hit. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">A new rogue-specific ability has been added to the 
          "Hide" skill. It is called "Evade". This skill has the effect of lowering 
          the amount that the targeted NPC hates the rogue, and has the potential 
          of making the engaged NPC switch to another target (preferably a tank) 
          within the rogue's group. It is essentially a "reverse taunt". This 
          ability helps mitigate the negative effects of the rogue's exceedingly 
          high damage-output potential. It also will in-turn help the rogue do 
          even more damage as the NPC is much more likely to expose its back. 
          It is engaged by targeting the NPC you wish to "Evade" and pressing 
          the "Hide" button. As a note, you must not be in combat mode in order 
          to use this ability.</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Mistwalker</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The Mistwalker will once again cast its spell as often 
        as it used to prior to the last patch. However, the resulting pet will 
        now automatically "dissipate" after one combat round. The change that 
        reduced the "proc" percentage on the weapon was made due to an unintended 
        interaction between the pet and the target when several users of this 
        weapon were attacking the same target. Since the new pet now automatically 
        dissipates after one round, the reduced "proc" percentage was no longer 
        necessary.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Class-Specific Armor Quests</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Class-Specific armor quests, especially those belonging 
        to Clerics, Paladins, and Shadowknights, have been reduced in terms of 
        how long it will take the average person to acquire the armor. These classes, 
        and others that found particular pieces of their armor exceedingly difficult 
        to obtain should find it much easier now.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">In addition, a bug that hindered completion of the Bracer 
        of Ro quest for some races has been corrected.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Tallon Zek </b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Loot rules for PvP deaths on the PvP-Teams server, Tallon 
        Zek, have been changed from "Coin + 1 item" to "Coin Only". This change 
        was made to study the impact of loot-rules upon server population in reference 
        to the loot/efficiency disparity between caster and melee characters. 
        This change is a test, and may or may not be retained or rolled out across 
        the other PvP servers, pending the results of the server population study 
        over the next few weeks. </font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Plane Changes</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Several changes have been implemented in the Planes as 
        part of this patch: </font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font size="2">Characters will now lose all enchantments upon entering 
          the Plane of Sky</font></li>
        <li><font size="2">Due to the fact that the levitate-series no longer 
          works within the Plane of Sky, a teleporter has been placed to allow 
          entrance into the quest room. </font></li>
        <li><font size="2">A teleporter has been placed within the Plane of Hate 
          in order to give non-casters a way out of the zone besides death, potion, 
          or group teleport. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Loot Messages</b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Messages indicating what has been looted from a corpse 
        will now be broadcast to everyone within the looters group. This change 
        was made due to public request and to encourage trust within the group. 
        We may, in the future, employ filters to allow people to choose whether 
        or not they wish to receive loot messages.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2"><b>Fiery Avenger </b></font></p>
      <p><font size="2">The greatly anticipated defining blade of the Paladin, 
        the "Fiery Avenger", is again available within game via a quest. The *first* 
        devout Paladin to wield this blade and be validated by a GM in-game will 
        be publicly congratulated within a patch message and on the Official EverQuest 
        web-site at www.everquest.com. </font></p>
