<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">litehealjr</div><div class="date">October 6th, 2004, 04:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can anyone give some information on where this ring event is?  I searched around, found several maps, but I am still not clear where to go to start the ring.<br />
<br />
According to the write up, this ring is triggered by killing everything in the room, then what? How long is the ring, how many waves of mobs are there?<br />
<br />
Is it really 3 people doable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Floydian</div><div class="date">October 6th, 2004, 07:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the write up tells you how many mobs and how many waves. just read a bit harder. <br />
<br />
I apologize if I didn't waste enough of my time, I'll hold your hand a bit more:<br />
<br />
From: http://www.andponcho.com/wizard/#fires<br />
<br />
Zone in from Sol B side, fight south until you get to the room just north of the room where the bridges form a lambda symbol (upside down Y).<br />
<br />
The room in question is a circular room with lava in the center. There will be 8 lava elementals in the area. 4 Lava Vindicators and 4 Lava Champions. Clear these. <br />
<br />
The room grows warmer as the lava pool begins to steam heavily.<br />
<br />
One minute later the next wave will spawn. This time, four Furious Magma Guardians will spawn, one on each of the 4 platforms. Clear these.<br />
<br />
The lava starts to bubble and churn. Dark shapes move beneath the molten rock.<br />
<br />
One minute later the next wave spawn. This time, two Inflamed Champions will spawn: one on the east ledge, one on the west. Clear these.<br />
<br />
The pool of lava begins to boil furiously. Something large is growing within.<br />
<br />
One minute later the final wave spawns. This time, the Pure Flame Elemental pops. He will spawn on the middle rock.<br />
<br />
Pure Flame Elemental says, 'Why have you awakened me mortals?'<br />
<br />
Kill him. He doesn't hit hard, but mitigates slow. Was a very short fight and didn't need any heals, except for the enchanter.<br />
<br />
You receive: Wisp of Pure Flame. Head back to Talwyn and hand it to him.<br />
<br />
Thats 8 in wave 1, 4 in wave 2, 2 in wave 3 and 1 in the final wave<br />
8+4+2+1 = 15.<br />
<br />
Yes its trioable. It is duoable. I have witnessed a shaman solo it. I'd repost the map showing exactly where the room is, but quoting pictures is lame.<br />
<br />
Also to save you from your inevitable second post: the respawn isn't definately known, its less than 8 hours and more than 2...</div></div><hr />

You can just take any tank...any healer...and yourself and not really worry much as long as you are Txevu peeps.  Nice.</div></div><hr />

All &quot;Txevu peeps&quot; gives you is the ability to tank the whole thing as a wizard. It's only 1 mob at a time for crying out loud, and as far as people have said there's no time limit on completing it the waves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Branaman Starbinder</div><div class="date">October 7th, 2004, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did this event when the zone was just new with 4 people. 65 druid, 64 paladin, 65 bard, 65 wizard, Sraa/HoT geared with a rare piece of Ornate.</div></div><hr />

Anyone know if they are mezzable though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terromon</div><div class="date">October 7th, 2004, 09:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i just did this with a 70 pally, and 68 shammy, (myself 70 wiz).  the shammy slowed everything up to the boss, and the pally didn't need 1 heal.  final boss shammy kept getting resisted, so pally tanked it unslowed.  hit up to the 600s i think he said.  anyways it was quick and easy.  elemental shammy, time+ geared wiz and pally.<br />
<br />
ohh and i got no emote about bubbling lava or anything like that, but we pulled all mob out of the ring-room, to the room to the north.<br />
<br />
hardest part of this event was showing the shammy and pally how to get to SolC from Sol B.  thats how easy it is</div></div><hr />

they are mezzable cuz tank pulled 2 for us when we went... so i mezzed one... not like i really needed to though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PyroshaneFlamethrower</div><div class="date">October 7th, 2004, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The funny thing is, I tell my guild I would love for one or two people to come out to help me, end up with two groups of time+ geared people clearing through solC to get me my wisp. Didn't take much time at all.  :grinyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cabby197</div><div class="date">October 7th, 2004, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, went solo.. too hard.. I stun tanked.. had 500 hp's left after first mob.. said screw that .. and got a druid to come help  heal me, and root dot.<br />
<br />
We got through the first 8 pretty fast.   Just killed right in the ring.<br />
<br />
But the second wave hits for 250+  and started eatting the poor druid on pop.<br />
2 kind of popped close to us so we ended up having 2.. and you all know that root never holds more then 2 seconds when you rally need it to. Strong root just sucks too!<br />
<br />
Anyway .. 2 resisted stuns and a evac later.. <br />
We didn't go back because we figured ther 3rd and 4th wave would prove to difficult for just us two. Some kind of melee / druid  and me could have easily done it. check my magelo .. if you want to know what I was working with.<br />
<br />
<br />
I like the bard incase something summons or hits 500+ range. I have timed it to nuke right before his mezz pulse hits.. so I take maybe one hit.. and it's mezzed again ..  Nuke / mezz , rune ..  repeat. If it can be rooted, he just dots it to death. he's also good for mana regen and slowing/ single pulls.  Hell.. bards are just a great caster combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ledilor</div><div class="date">October 8th, 2004, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also tried this solo the other night. I got the first 7 down, but was a little slow and started to get respawns(I was trying to time it so I'd be close to fom as the 8th died). So I stepped up the pace a little and killed the 8th mob and then the two repops.<br />
<br />
I went to the center to wait for the second wave to pop (doh) figuring that they wouldn't aggro. Well, pop all 4 aggro, evacced with 33 hp, lol. It was late so I had to log, might try it again. I definitely think it is doable.<br />
<br />
btw, I went into this with roughly 8500hp and 8500mana give or take a bit.<br />

If they have not changed the event from what it was before epic, I was able to do it with a Magician (65), Shaman (65), Rogue (65) and Wizard (65).  Two people boxing two characters, only one of us (me) had some elemental level gear.  Pull the mobs out of the spawn room to the prior room, they have a fairly small assist radius.  Be sure to re-clear the pull area of respans after the wave of 4 is completed so that you do not get repops on the harder 2 span and main mob.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know do you have to do prior steps before the piece will drop, or you can loot it?  I would love to spend an off day getting the piece, and it may be some time before I could get the forces together for the earlier tougher battles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khael</div><div class="date">October 8th, 2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did it out of order and got the wisp drop, Gwideon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benkane</div><div class="date">October 8th, 2004, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did this last night with a Bard/Cleric box combo, 1 shaman, 1 SK and me.  By far, getting to this spot is much harder then completing the event.<br />
<br />
Started from SolB side and about half way down clearing as we go, 20 mobs jumped on us.  In the end, we couldn't hold it so I evaced us.  We figgured that one had someone training us otw out.  Well now at the SolA side(where evac takes you), on the second goblin kill like 30 goblins came rushing at us.  It was a great swarm of them I tell you!  Evaced...again...started...again...and only got a train of 15'ish goblins which we eventually killed.  Finally got to the ring event and creamed it.  Stupid mobs pathing / chain agro, no wonder no one EXP's tehre for the level its made for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zappity</div><div class="date">October 11th, 2004, 09:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">did with just me and boxed clr for heals/paci. a mix of kiting and just straight tanking... for first two waves i would kite the first couple mobs going back and forth across the rock in room before ring. then when i had cleared a bit of room inside i would just kite there. basically pretty hard to tank anything after 1st wave .. stuns does not land much and they hit for like 400 or so pretty fast. i guess could do with uber hps but im only 6k with just v and shielding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quas</div><div class="date">October 11th, 2004, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got bored waiting for our guild tanks to login, so we went with a 57 War.  This event is nice and easy.  In addition, a nice caster bracer usually drops (the rare drop is a melee necklace with I think 50 hp/mana and some great saves for the effort)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xenir</div><div class="date">October 11th, 2004, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did this with a 70 drood. Was quite easy though I'd say some sort of healer or tank is required due to final mob summoning and hitting hard enough (550ish I recall) that I couldn't MT without a heal.<br />
<br />
On a separate note we only killed 3 champs and 2 vindis before 2nd wave spawned on top of us.  It's a good thing they root/snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceWynd</div><div class="date">October 28th, 2004, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just need a tank, healer, and you. They don't have a ton of HP's except for the last mob which isn't even that bad either.<br />
<br />
I tried to 2/box duo whis with my 66 Mage and 70 Wiz. Cleared all the way to the ring fine. Had to root park a ton on the way there...was able to invis past a few mobs too up until the fire elementals (see invis).<br />
<br />
First wave went ok, wiped on second wave when mob spawned where I was standing and I only had 2k hps left just before that wave.<br />
<br />
Got corpses summoned and went back in with a pally, cleric, enc (trio boxed), mag, and wiz (duo boxed) and did it with ease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">valdaym</div><div class="date">October 28th, 2004, 10:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this fight is easy.  I reccomend taking a bit of overkill if its available though.  we went with cleric sk wiz  was cake but took like a hour or more to clear then do ring.  couple more dps and we could have cut that in half.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antionides</div><div class="date">October 28th, 2004, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did this with a Shaman, Warrior &amp; Me.<br />
<br />
Getting there through the trash was the biggest PITA, everything else was really easy. Max hit was 500ish on the last few mobs..again this is really easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quesci</div><div class="date">November 3rd, 2004, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was surprised by the event.  When I got there with a chanter, cleric, necro team, none of the mobs were named &quot;Lava Vindicator&quot; or &quot;Lava Champion&quot;, but rather were ordinary elemental mobs.  Cleared them expecting to start the ring and have the Champions/Vindicators spawn, but none did.  We got some more normal elemental pops in the room (no Furious Magma Guardians or whatever) before we needed to move out of the room due to low mana.<br />
<br />
While I was rereading the spoilers to find out why the ring event wasn't starting, the Pure Flame Elemental popped.  We pulled him and he died very fast and I looted my Wisp of Pure Flame.  There were no zone emotes the entire time.<br />
<br />
I don't care why the ring didn't work.  I got my epic 15 minutes later.</div></div><hr />

Can wizards can bind in Sol C?  That might make it a lot easier to get a guild group in to do this fight (with the teleport bind AA).<br />
Aye, all bind classes can bind there.  We always have the cleric bind in the zone because the run can be time consuming.  Even if that were changed since I last tried, you could always bind in SolA and SolB, you would just have to swim the lava.</div></div><hr />

Bah, it would be quicker to just gather the group to do it.  I wouldn't add it to your list for only this purpose.</div></div><hr />
