          Put together a Summary of the Forum. It's not the greatest mind you. 
          For I wrote it inbetween my battles during meditation. For those of 
          you who couldn't make it, <a href="ForumSummary.htm" target="main">here</a> 
          it is for you.<br>

          Added items: Lizardscale Cloak and Runed Circlet to the Armor page.<br>
          Added item: Silver Rose Engagement Ring to the Equipment page.<br>
          Added items: Dragoon Dirk and Slime Crystal Staff to the Weapons page.</p>
        <p>Right now with the complete site running on two shells, both are hovering 
          around 60% of thier allocated thruput. I've got a feeling that with 
          these new items, they are going to be pushed over the edge. If this 
          happens, I will do my best to shell some money out of my pocket to increase 
          the bandwidth. Something I wasn't planning on doing, but I really enjoy 
          all of you visiting and using the message board. </p>
        <p>As for the journal on what happened last night, I haven't had time 
          to throw one together as I was working on the item submissions. Thank 
          you all for your understanding and patience.... I'm on the case! =)</p>

          Boy did I blow it. As you can see below, I put the time down as PST.. 
          when infact it was EST. The info page was correct, but I'm sure a few 
          of you were very confused. I apoligize for this. Regardless of this 
          error, there was a tremendous showing of Wizards. So many in fact that 
          the Forum was moved to chat where it could be moderated. Brad showed 
          along with a total of 6 GM's including Geoffrey Z, the lead magic/spell 
          programmer. For a long time it felt like everything we said was shot 
          down in flames by them but in the end they started to listen and reason 
          and actually said they were to make improvements and look into areas 
          we discussed. A huge thanks goes out to Indalamar for getting all of 
          this going.</p>
        <p>I have a few additions and updates to post soon.. just need to do some 
          graphic editing. </p>

          Due to many requests, I have implemented a message board. I waited to 
          do so for so long due to the fact that my cgi is overloaded as well 
          as my bandwidth. =) I apoligize for the little ad banners at the bottom 
          of each message board page, but it was part of the deal to get it upon 
          another server. Keep it clean and all I ask is that if you are responding 
          or posting about a spoiler, that you put something in the message header 
          letting people know so. Thanks and enjoy!</p>

          Have had a few requests for a listing of what spells are available for 
          purchase in what towns. I've got Neriak covered but if anybody wishes 
          to help out, please <a href="mailto:bweetz@best.com">send</a> in the 
          info and I will compile a chart asap.</p>

          Just recieved a courtesy call from my web host. ((Grin)) Very politely 
          wanted to warn me that my site was about to be shut down. Funny, I could 
          have sworn it was shut down yesterday? </p>
        <p>Anybody out there work for 3dFX, Diamond, Verant, or any other game 
          related company that has connections within that would be willing to 
          throw a logo up here somewhere for a bit of cash? Hehe.. just kidding. 
          Hopefully, this site will be able to handle the load very soon. I moved 
          yet another page to a different shell in hopes of evening out the traffic. 
          Thanks to everybody that views the site and sends in their compliments! 
          Positive reinforcement helps keep me going. I hope to start putting 
          more updates on Wizard info instead of this info concerning the status 
          of the site soon!</p>

          Moved some of the graphic intensive pages to different shell I have. 
          Hope that releives some of the stress the site is experiencing. Again, 
          I am very sorry for the happenings and I know how frustrating it is 
          when a site is slow, not to mention down completely. This website should 
          never be slow for the connection it has is of the highest bandwidth.</p>

          Seems that the traffic on this site is picking up. I've maxed out my 
          quota for bandwidth and its time to find either sponsors or somebody 
          willing to host this site. I am terribly sorry for the Error 500 that 
          many of you may have experienced today. Hope to soon have it rectified.</p>

          Not much happening as of late. Beware that all bolt spells <b>do not</b> 
          work since the patch this morning. Had a rude crash today in Cazic Thule. 
          Our full party was fighting a few lizards when the last thing I remember 
          is casting Force Shock when 'poof', I was back at my desktop. Tried 
          restarting EQ twice and crashed to desktop both times while loading 
          character selection screen. Rebooted and logged on successfully only 
          to find one party member dead and me in the middle of the courtyard 
          with one bubble of life left. Put two and two together and zoned. Seems 
          the entire party crashed for some reason or another and all had to reboot 
          to get back online. If anybody has had this problem, please send me 
          an email so I can see it is just me or there is a majority of us.</p>
        <p>On a side note, a good Dark Elven Wizard friend on Xegony named Indalamar 
          has had it with the current status of our, so to speak, powers. He is 
          holding a wizard forum on Monday, June 14th at 8pm EST. It will be held 
          at the zone drop in Greater Faydark on the Xegony Server (Click <a href="home/GreaterFaydarkForum.jpg" target="_blank">here</a> 
          for map). All are encouraged to come as he is trying to get GM's to 
          show so that they can see the number of frustrated Wizards out there.<br>

          Added a few zones to the <a href="maps/maps.html" target="main">map</a> 
          area: Beholder, Misty Thicket, and Runnyeye. I also put a link to the 
          maker of the majority of the individual zone maps. I stated before a 
          while back that I did not create the maps but I wished to give credit 
          where credit is due. Therefore, I edited in a statement onto the world 
          map so all can see each time. Mapping out a zone is not an easy task 
          and alot of time and frustration is put into each map. These people 
          make our traveling much easier and deserve all the credit in Norrath. 
          As I find maps that I feel are of great quality, I will add them to 
          the missing zones. Enjoy.</p>

          Last night while in Cazic Thule, I came across a player I have seen 
          many times. Only this time, she had in her possession an item that many 
          of us are extremely interested in, the Staff Of Writhing. She was kind

          I know how it is when you have a new item and get flooded with 'tells').

        <p> Updated the Bear Hide Quest with a format I may adopt for the whole 
          site for statistic pictures. Let me know if you have any problems with 
          it. Thank you to everyone that is sending in information. The more you 
          send the better the site becomes for us!</p>
