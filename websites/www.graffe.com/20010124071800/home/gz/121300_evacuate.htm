        <p> <font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This conversation 
          took place on Tuesday, December 12th 2000. This concerns a couple issues 
          behind the level 57 wizard spell, Evacuate: </font> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Graffe</b>: 
            Hello Geoff. I was wondering if you could look at and test the level 
            57 wizard spell, Evacuate. Supposedly, it is to use 750 mana from 
            the caster. I've had people report it pulling in upwards of 1200 mana 
            from the wizard when cast. Aside from the wizard, it is also draining 
            mana from the party members (approximately 500 mana from party members).</font></p>
          <div align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>GZ: 
            Heh - it has always drained mana from party members. That was built 
            into the spell from the very beginning. It is an anti-cheese method 
            that we put in in Kunark beta - something we had to do since the teleport 
            wipes the hate list (if we didn't wipe the hate list, imaging the 
            trains...). If we didn't drain mana from the party, people would drag 
            monsters to the evac point, fight a little, and then evac. Monster 
            wanders off, gets blasted at range, and then the party evac's again. 
            Repeat, and you have a new in-dungeon kiting system. This spell reduces 
            the down time from having to travel back several zones to get to where 
            you were - but there is still down time after you use the spell.</b></font></div>

          <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>GZ: 
            There is a mana cost - and then, when the spell actives, a mana drain. 
            If you still have mana left, then it drains. If you don't have the 
            mana, the spell still goes off, and then it drains your non-existant 
            mana. So the guy with 1/2 mana looses less mana then the guy with 
            full mana. </b></font></p>
