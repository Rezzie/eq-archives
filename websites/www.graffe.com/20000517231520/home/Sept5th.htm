          New Poll Posted. This question asks if when battling large mobs such 

          as Lady Vox or Nagafen, should Verant somehow implement a way to link 

          two or more groups together so that they may share experience and converse 

          in chat? Granted, this would have to be initiated by a Guide or GM because 

          they would not allow the player to do it and have the whole party clear 

          a zone with ease. It would only be useful for the BIG mob's.</p>

          Whoops... sorry about the Spreadsheet download. It's in a zip format 

          now that will allow you to download instead of opening from the source. 

          This Spreadsheet also requires you to have Microsoft Excel installed 

          on your machine to view.</p>

          Itzokae Blastenburn of Cazic-Thule was kind enough to throw together 

          a Mana/Intelligence spreadsheet. Download it <a href="../programs/manaint.zip">here</a> 

          or from the <a href="../programs/programs.htm">Programs</a> page. </p>

        <p>Took the poll down and will put up another in a bit. The end results 

          were right where I thought they would be: Should your invisible spell 

          icon flash as well when it is about to drop? <br>

          YES = 1462 votes (94%)<br>

          NO = 100 votes (6%)<br>

          Total Votes = 1562</p>

        <p>Just a note that the item submits are not coming in quite as often 

          and it seems that the ones that do are being sent in with severe quality 

          reduction due to compression into Jpeg. If you do wish to send in items, 

          I really appreciate the full un-edited bmp. It is MUCH easier for me 

          to work with. I understand that many of you like to try to help by 'pre-editing' 

          them but it is actually more work for me. So the moral of the story: 

          Big BMP's are Good. Small Jpegs are Bad. =) Thanks to all of the submitters... 

          Keep them coming!</p>

          *Yawn* Well, I kept my promise.. I updated the Armor pages to split 

          it up a bit. There are a couple errors that I have made and the main 

          page isn't what I wish it to be.. but it has been a very, very long 

          day for me and I need to cut it short. I will clean it all up tomorrow 

          morning. At least it's in a working state. Good night to all of you.</p>

          Haha! I just got a mail from an individual, bored and noticed I haven't 

          updated today as of yet. Well, so you know.. I'm hard at work trying 

          to redo the Armor page. It has grown in size so I needed to break it 

          up. Quite an undertaking so far (but you guys won't notice.. it will 

          look just about the same). It will just help with the download times 

          for the viewers with 56k's. I may need to finish it up when I get home.. 

          so please be patient. (I won't even log into EQ until it's done).</p>

          Ice Comet Rune Quest: You must be of level 50 with your Research Skill 

          maxed out in order to create the rods into the Staff and Star. If you 

          try to do so at a lower level, you will fail and all of your running 

          around Norrath will be for nothing. A bit of info on the Killer Sharks 

          also. I have seen on the message boards where people were wondering 

          what they gave for loot. The loot is random but a friend of mine on 

          Xegony has received a Sapphire from one of them (which sells for about 

          89pp to a vendor). Thanks to Xaia of Xegony for sending in the tidbits 

          of info!</p>

        <p>PVP to Non-PVP Player: Some of you may of heard of the player on Prexus 

          that was turned from PVP to non-PVP. He e-mailed me with the pictures 

          he took of the occasion.. beautiful spell the GM's casted upon him. 

          Take note of the name change too. Must be nice to be all powerful, eh? 

          Thanks for sending in the pictures Fitch!</p>

          Ice Comet Rune Quest: Numerous e-mails, in game tells, and I confirmed 

          that the Glowing Chest that you get from Sulgar disappears when you 

          log. It is a NO DROP item so you cannot give it to your banker to hold 

          either. This could be quite detrimental if you were to fill your box 

          with your rods and log out. This situation has already happened to one

          I received many <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">e-mails</a> concerning 

          the spawn time of the Ice Comet Quest rods. Some e-mails saying one 

          hour and some saying one minute. With the differences between the times 

          I decided to call upon a good friend to verify this for me. Here is 

          what he found out: The first rod he picked up and waited only one minute 

          before it respawned. He picked that rod up also. After he picked up 

          the second rod, he waited 35 minutes and no respawn. So he zoned and 

          came back in to find the rod there. He repeated this process twice so 

          it seems that zoning played a part in the spawn process of it all. This 

          should not be a problem due to the fact that the rods are LORE NO DROP, 

          but if the individual was to sit in the zone after he picked up the 

          rod... you might be waiting a while for the next spawn. Huge thank you 

          to Keiote' of Xegony for confirming this!</p>

          Getting lots of confirmations on the Charm Bug.... and I mean LOTS. 

          I have taken it upon myself to e-mail Brad McQuaid concerning the bug 

          so hopefully this may be looked into. One viewer even took the time 

          to send in a picture of his inventory showing what exactly happens. 

          Keep in mind that pictures of your e-mail will do nothing to convince 

          Verant that you were subject to the bug due to the fact that it is far 

          to easy to edit a pic. All you can do is leave the item where it is, 

          petition and wait... and wait... and wait. Thanks to Glinlor Stormweaver 

          for sending in the screenshot.</p>

          Concerning the disappearing melee item while charmed bug: Had another 

          viewer send in e-mail stating that this has happened to a member of 

          a party they were in during an expedition in Guk. Their party members 

          Black Tome turned into a beaded necklace of some sort. The GM could 

          not do anything for there was no way to prove they had a book before 

          hand. This was due to the person removing the necklace from their melee 

          slot. If they were to leave the necklace in the melee spot (which is 

          impossible for a player to put in the melee slot), the GM may have well 

          of fixed the situation. So, if this happens to you, don't touch a thing.. 

          simply petition the situation. Thanks to Soren of The Rathe for the 

          confirm. </p>

          While in Misty Thicket, causing havoc with the locals by killing their 

          guards, I came across a Gnome with a unique item as well as a name that 

          I found hilarious. Ichiban Anklebiter (damn that's classic) was holding 

          a shovel in his hand for a weapon. He was even kind enough to give me 

          one! Now I beg of you not to go asking him for one.. he has a game to 

          play too. Just go check it out upon the <a href="../weapons/weapons.htm" target="main">Weapons</a> 

          page under Blunt Weapons. I have the stat pic and a screenshot of him 

          wielding it. Thank you Ichiban!</p>

          <font color="#FFFFFF">Bug Report</font>: Seems that if you do not wield 

          a weapon in your main melee slot but hold an item such as a Glowing 

          Black Stone or a Black Tome of Silver Runes and you become charmed by 

          an NPC, the item has a chance of vanishing completely from your inventory 

          when the charmer throws you into hand to hand combat. The person that 

          reported it lost a Glowing Black Stone due to being charmed. Thanks 

          to Vanya of Quellious for the info.. sorry to hear of your loss.<br>

          Even though I am working on the new spell page, I thought I better do 

          some small updates to the listing. Some corrections and additions have 

          been made to the listing that is currently available. Thanks to Cabar 

          of Xegony for helping me out with these.<br>

          I have been getting conflicting reports that faction does and does not 

          take place in the Ice Comet Quest. I will try to log on at lunch and 

          verify for myself. (I have killed a few Halas guards.. so that should 

          be a good test). I have not been told if the NPC's attack or just wont 

          speak to you if your faction is not good with them.</p>

          Well, rather swamped at work. Found a bit of time to finally redo the 

          <a href="../quests/quests.htm" target="main">Quest</a> pages. This format 

          will make it much easier for me to edit them and should get rid of the 

          'smearing' effect some browsers see with certain layer effects.</p>

          Good morning. Had a viewer send me <a href="mailto:graffe@graffe.com">e-mail</a> 

          asking about a new robe that is supposedly found by completing a quest. 

          Any information on this item would be very much appreciated. The robe 

          is called the Phoenix Diamond Robe and has the following attributes: 

          AC 27. +19 int, +19 dex, +19 agil, +55 mana.</p>

          A viewer sent me this reply he received from GZ concerning the balance 

          issues with the classes, Wizards in particular. I apologize to the submitter 

          for taking so long to post this, but I wished to get GZ's permission 

          to do so. So, here it is in all its glory.... please take all discussion 

          to the Rant message board. Thanks!</p>

        <p> <font color="#FFFFFF">Geoffrey Z</font>: &quot;I honestly feel that 

          most spell casting classes are pretty well balanced. Wizards complain 

          a lot that they don't have the versatility at higher levels - but I 

          also get an equal number of e-mails from Druids, saying that they wish 

          that they were more specialized. They feel that people would rather 

          have a Wizard then them - since a Wiz can do more damage, and a Cleric 

          is better at healing. At this point, I feel that most magic classes 

          are very well balanced - we won't be changing much in the future with 

          what spells / the power of spells that the casting classes get. Most 

          people won't be happy with this - they feel that their particular class 

          is underpowered. But for every class we tweak, other classes feel that 

          they are now worse (we up the Wizard damage, give them new spells, then 

          Druids feel that they are no longer needed. We let Wizards have DoTs, 

          and then Necros and Shamans say they aren't needed, etc.). We are in 

          a pretty good balance state right now... Geoffrey C. Zatkin&quot;</p>
