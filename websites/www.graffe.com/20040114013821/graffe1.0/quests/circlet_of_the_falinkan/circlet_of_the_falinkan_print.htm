<p>This quest, also known as 'Ralgyn's Son', starts in Skyshrine by speaking to 
  the wurm named Ralgyn.</p>

<p align="center"><b>.:: <a href="http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm26">Circlet 
  of the Falinkan Forum</a> ::.</b></p>
<p align="left">Goto Skyshrine and travel up through the maze until you come to 
  the room with two Wurms in it, Lawya (for Hsagra's Wrath Quest) and Ralgyn <i>(picture 
  needed)</i>. Hail Ralgyn.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>You say, 'Hail Ralgyn'</p>
  <p>Ralgyn says 'Hello Rombus , what brings you to these sacred quarters on this 
    day? If it is treasure that you seek please ask someone else for I do not 
    have time to think of such petty things. My worries are much greater at this 
    time I am afraid. </p>
  <p>You say, 'what are your worries?'</p>
  <p>Ralgyn says 'Well I suppose I can tell you of my promise if you are willing 
    to listen as I do not feel you have intentions of using anything I tell you 
    against my dragonkin. Not many can walk these quarters unless they are very 
    trusted amongst us. </p>
  <p>You say, 'what was your promise?'</p>
  <p>Ralgyn says 'I made a promise a very long time ago to my wingmate Faliana, 
    a promise that I feel I may have broken. </p>
  <p>You say, 'how was your promise broken?'</p>
  <p>Ralgyn says 'I promised my dear Faliana that I would always keep her talisman 
    close to me. If something has happened to my son I must retain his talisman 
    so that I may keep Faliana's Talisman secure, as I promised her I always would. 
    Before she perished she split her talisman into two pieces one of which I 
    always will carry and the other half which my son Glanitar carries. My son 
    has not returned to me for some time and I am deeply concerned for this is 
    not normal behavior for him. I fear something must have happened to him for 
    he has never been so involved in his training to not inform me of his whereabouts 
    or to not come visit. </p>
  <p>You say, 'what was his training?'</p>
  <p>Ralgyn says 'It seems like it was only yesterday that my only son Glanitar 
    was practicing his skills as a young Wurm. Before long he quickly mastered 
    many fighting skills and the development of his magical skills rapidly progressed. 
    He was coming along so well in his training that he was quickly drafted for 
    the Patrol. Even when he was away for his training he would often return to 
    me and tell me of his progress. I was very proud of him for his involvement 
    with the Patrol. Although I am very proud of his accomplishments, I have not 
    seen him for longer then I have ever been away from him and I fear for the 
    worst. </p>
  <p>You say, 'what is the patrol?'</p>
  <p>Ralgyn says 'Ah yes, the patrol. Well in the Great Divide there is a collection 
    of caves that the dragonkind holds as a sacred territory. For this reason 
    we always have a number of our strongest up and coming younger ones train 
    there with the great [Kardakor]. They patrol the caved labyrinth to make sure 
    it is free from unwanted intruders who are quickly dealt with upon discovery. 
  </p>
  <p>You say, 'who is kardakor?'</p>
  <p>Ralgyn says 'Kardakor is a strong and powerful Warrior. He has fought in 
    many battles against the vile Giants and is well respected amongst our people 
    as a champion. For this reason when one was needed to train our young fighters 
    seeking guidance in developing both their magical and fighting techniques 
    it was clear to us who we should select for this honor, Kardakor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, head to Great Divide and seek out Kardakor <i>(picture needed)</i>. He's 
  located in the wurm caves to the right of the area where the Guardian Wurms 
  live. There is a KoS wurm next to him but I was able to complete this part without 
  agroing the wurm.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>You say, 'Hail Kardakor'</p>
  <p>Kardakor says 'Hello Rombus . It is not very often that I see adventurers 
    back in this cave unless they have intentions of hurting the kind wurms here. 
    I can only hope that for your sake that your intentions are good. </p>
  <p>You say, 'i am looking for glanitar'</p>
  <p>Kardakor says 'Glanitar? It has been quite long sense I have seen Glanitar, 
    I fear that something unfortunate has become of him. It is not like him at 
    all to be away for this long. He was out on normal patrol with a few others 
    when they disappeared. We have not heard from any of them. </p>
  <p>You say, 'where did they disappear?'</p>
  <p>Kardakor says 'This, I do not know. There are a few Giant forces that I have 
    heard word of moving into the area. It is tough to say where they could have 
    gone and if something happened to them or not who would be to blame. I highly 
    doubt the Coldain would dare attack one of our units. The last I heard of 
    them was when they left for the patrol of the Divide; this could have been 
    anywhere. I remember that Glanitar carries a talisman from his mother. If 
    you are to find any sign of Glanitar or any of the others please come to me 
    first along with something that would symbolize who you received or took it 
    from.' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>From here get a group of 12, 55+ people or one good group of 60s. Find Taskmaster 
  Aboytt<i> (picture needed)</i> (you should get a tracker if possible, he's located 
  near the wurm caves) and kill him. A Shaman can slow him (his MR is very, very 
  low) and once he is slowed, he's easy. The Taskmaster cons yellow to a 60, but 
  doesn't hit that hard. Once he dies he drops a sword (not needed for the quest), 
  a piece of a talisman <i>(picture needed)</i>, and a head <i>(picture needed)</i>. 
  Take the head and the talisman back to Kardakor. He gives you the talisman back. 
  Now, seek out Rolandal <i>(picture &amp; loc needed)</i> and hail her...</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p>You say, 'Hail Rolandal'</p>
  <p>Rolandal says, 'It would be my guess that you present this to me in hopes 
    to find out more about the magics it possesses. Before I can do this I require 
    some rare treasures that you must present to me.&quot;</p>
  <p>You say, 'what rare treasures?'</p>
  <p>Rolandal says, 'There are 3 items that I seek to continue my studies of some 
    various and musterious magics. Bring to me the teachings of a high ranking 
    Kromzek that I hear goes by the name of Gkrean, a chipped fang from a beast 
    deep within the Cursed Necropolis. Also for good measure, I require the Head 
    of a Kromzek Staff Sergeant to prove to your dedication to our cause. Present 
    these 3 items to me along with your Talisman that you wish to learn more about 
    and I shall do my best to identify its origin for you.'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gather these items:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Head of Staff Sergeant Drioc <i>(picture needed)</i> - Found in Kael on 
    Staff Sergeant Drioc in the bank at Kael. He can be taken down easily by a 
    group of 55+. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Teachings of Gkrean <i>(picture needed)</i> - Found on Gkrean in the Arena 
    in Kael. He has two Cleric guardians and is a Cleric himself (he gates and 
    complete heals), conned red to a 60. He can be killed with a group of high 
    levels, but I would reccomend getting your friends for this. You should be 
    able to single pull the two Cleric guards (using FD or a Bard) then go into 
    his room and fight him to prevent gating. He doesn't hit very hard, but the 
    gating / CHing makes him a challenge. <br>
  </li>
  <li>a chipped fang <i>(picture needed)</i> - Drops from Vilefang in Dragon Necropolis. 
    When you go down the ramp proceed to Zlandicar's lair, the serpent in the 
    water there has been replaced with Vilefang. Can be taken out easily by a 
    group of high levels. He blinds and casts. Seems to be on a 24+ hour spawn, 
    but has no PHs.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have these items hand them back to Rolandar along with the talisman 
  and you will recieve an Imbued Talisman. Go back up to Ralgyn and hand this 
  item to him. It will result in the Circlet of the Falinkan.<br>
