Based on what I was able to glean from Xenosis (http://www.archofchaos.com/zone.asp) it looks like they are way down south past the 2nd castle near the winding path to Fennin's spawn.  How do I safely get there if I get invited to a kite group? (not enuff mana for quadding)  I have been past the first castle near the charm birds.<br />
<br />
Anything else I need to know about this camp would be appreciated.  I have read Gem's library post on quadding them, so I know not to do it if the Guardian of Doomfire is up among other things.</div></div><hr />

It's pretty easy to get there invis, just hug the zone edge from castle 1 and watch out for see invis horses/named until you get to castle 2.<br />
<br />
Everything in castle 2 sees invis, so wait until the 2 guards patrolling outside are away from the entrance then run in, keeping away from the buildings as much as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zawrym</div><div class="date">September 7th, 2004, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Carlos is correct on everything. Adding that the see invis mobs in the second castle have very small agro ranges so you can get by mobs you might not think you could at first glance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siene</div><div class="date">September 9th, 2004, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to love fire tables, and the exp still can't be beat for solo time really.  Our server has a high % of pick up raids, that have killed  RZ and Sol Ro, so Fire has basically become just another /ooc LFG zone.   We also have something like 10 or 12 guilds who are elemental now.  So basically, if you are level 65, you most likely have access.<br />
<br />
If you have exodus up and nexus gate, quadding even with the big red devil standing watching, is not that tough.  It just takes a little extra balls and a lot of skill.  But, you do not have to quad there, you can kite singles if that is your preference.  In fact, if other people are there, I personally won't quad anyway  If I mess up or miss timing and have to evac or die, 1 mob on the lose is  easier for other kiters to deal with them 4 mobs on the lose.<br />
<br />
I like quadding groups also.  If the group is willing its nice exp and fast.</div></div><hr />

Took like 40 minutes of straight kiting for about 6 Gold.</div></div><hr />

How long does a quad take to burn down solo? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carlo the Curious</div><div class="date">September 10th, 2004, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 mob = about 15% AA, if I recall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are 14% per mob so they come out to be 56% of an AA per quad.<br />
<br />
How long does a quad take to burn down solo? <br />
This depends somewhat on your mana pool due to the fact that if you have to med kite them it will take a bit longer. If you have enough mana to kill them without medding then it takes about 8-10 mins.<br />
<br />
So effectively you can do a quad every 20 mins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
How much mana do you think it would take to not have to med kite?<br />
<br />
I know I'm propably looking at group kiting with my mana pool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mysthawk</div><div class="date">September 10th, 2004, 01:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last I heard it was like 6k or 8k mana for a full kite with no medding.  Though since I'm not EP flagged I don't know for certain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caemien</div><div class="date">September 10th, 2004, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Between 6-6.5k you should be ok quadding without having to med. Make sure to have KEI or VoQ and FoE helps if you don't have run 5.<br />
<br />
I'm at 8.3k mana pool and I end up with about 20-30% of my mana left after a quad.<br />
<br />
Another note is to time your snares. You can use a timer for this, or do what I do. Cast snare, do /ti for a time check so that I know when to recast. I actually pull with snare as well, though I know some Wizards like to round up the mobs and then snare. I find it a bit safer to pull with snare. Once I get them all rouned up I recast snare on the group to ensure they are all on the same snare timer.<br />
<br />
One thing I have noted is that snares land on the mobs always in the same order. So if you get a resist or two, note which of the 4 mobs were snared and which were not. <br />
<br />
i.e. <br />
<br />
You begin casting snare<br />
A Doomfire Protector was shackled to the ground<br />
A Doomfire Protector was shackled to the ground<br />
A Doomfire Protector resist Atol's spectral shackles<br />
A Doomfire Protector resist Atol's spectral shackles<br />
<br />
<br />
In this example the 1st 2 are snared, start your timer, recast snare and ensure mobs 3 and 4 get snared. Your timer should be based on the 1st mob that got snared, not the last. I also begin my recast of snare at 2 minutes rather than waiting until the 2:30 timer is almost expired. This gives me 30 seconds to ensure all 4 mobs are snared again before it wears off.<br />
<br />
As with other quad kiting efforts, try working on one mob 1st. If you can kill one mob with pillar of frost on your mana pool, then you can do 4.  I would venture to say that 25% of my mana used is on snares and the rest is used for pillars.</div></div><hr />

Im getting about an AA an hour in HoH. Sounds like in Fire I could do 1.5+ AAs per hour.</div></div><hr />

I suspect the previous poster had his experience split between normal and AA.<br />
<br />
Conversely in a six pack, you get 5% AA experience per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aelain</div><div class="date">September 14th, 2004, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Spent my first extended time at the tables last night.  In a &quot;6-pack,&quot; each mob is worth a tad over 5% AA(I went from 50 to 56% in one kill as the rounding evened out) and 1% normal XP.  Duoing, they are 9% AA each, 6% in a 4-group.  They die so much faster in a 6-pack:)  Hands down the best experience in the game that I have access to.  <br />
<br />
I was there for almost 4 hours last night and got 24% regular and 3.2+ AAs (I wanted to finish off SCS3 before I went all regular).</div></div><hr />
