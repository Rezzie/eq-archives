        <p>>>>Why don't you make up your mind. </p>
        <p><b>Sure twinkcity, if you are going to take quotes out-of-context, 
          you should almost be able to make me say anything you like. Taken in 
          context, I said that wizards are basically fine, but I won't go and 
          say that *any* class is perfect. </b></p>
        <p>>>>What about all the player expectations?</p>
        <p> <b>Many of the complaints I've seen quote a line from the Wizard description. 
          Your's is no exception: "when it comes to dishing out damage, wizards 
          have no rival."</b></p>
        <p><b> I'm beginning to think that the problem here is that Wizards had 
          this expectation that they'd be much more powerful than the other casting 
          classes. But that line you've quoted speaks of Direct Damage spells, 
          and is true in that application. </b></p>
        <p><b>The Wizard is the most straightforward casting class in the game, 
          in the same fashion that the warrior is the most straightforward melee 
          class. There's not much strategy to them, they do one thing and they 
          do that one thing well. The addition of travel spells does add some 
          diversity, but they are still primarily the same. We really have no 
          plans to redefine the class. </b></p>
