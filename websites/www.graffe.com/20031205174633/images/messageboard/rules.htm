      <p>The forums are here for anyone to post on. This is a website dedicated 
        to the wizard class of Everquest but we do get visitors from other classes 
        as well. There is no reason other classes cannot come to these forums 
        and join in with the conversations.</p>
      <p><b>General rules</b>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid personal attacks. If you don't agree with what someone posted, 
          debate their post... not the person that posted it.</li>
        <li> Keep the profanity to a minimum. Keep in mind that this website and 
          it's forums are visited by people of all ages and ethnic backgrounds. 
          Many of which do not appreciate vulgar language. So, the less there 
          is, the better the forums are for everyone. Besides.. a foul mouth doesn't 
          make you look very impressive.</li>
        <li> Try your hardest to post in the appropriate forum. Don't be upset 
          if we move your post to a more approriate forum. If we happen to move 
          a post, don't publically throw a tantrum concerning it.</li>
        <li>Pornography will not be allowed in any way, shape, or form.</li>
        <li>No advertisements.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Signature rules</b>:</p>
      <p>I'll be the first to admit that I love the imagination and creativity 
        put behind some of the signatures at the bottom of some of the posts. 
        However, some people don't realize that there are still some people out 
        there on dialup modems. Huge signatures can dramatically increase the 
        time it takes for some to load the pages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your complete signature file should not exceed 30kb in size.</li>
        <li>Keep the physical size of your signature to a decent size. Common 
          banner-ad sizing (468x60 pixels) is a good example of an appropriate 
          physical size.</li>
        <li>Only post your custom signature <u>once</u> per thread. If you are 
          posting a second time in a thread, uncheck the &quot;Include custom 
          signature&quot; box before clicking on the 'Post' button.<br>
        </li>
      </ul>
