                rare MoBs/drops, and a relative lack of danger. For characters 

                in the 25-35 level range - especially Rangers and Druids - the 

                &quot;Spires&quot; area of South Karana offers all four things

                &quot;Track-n'-Whack&quot; rare MoBs in SK. By combining a steady 

                diet of gnolls from the Spires with the occasional rare MoB, you 

                can steadily level and earn cash while exploiting every opportunity 

                to nab a rare and valuable item.</font></p>

                comparison's sake, the Strike Force is composed of a Mage, a Druid, 

                and a Ranger of approximately equal level. We started at the Spires

                south from the bridge that connects North Karana to South Karana, 

                you will eventually come upon the Spires. The Spires are impossible 

                to miss for anyone traveling in the southern part of SK - look 

                for the three tall talon-shaped towers jutting skyward around 

                a small hilly area. Indeed, the Spire area is supposed to represent 

                an upside-down gnoll paw pointing skyward, with the Spires serving 

                as the gnoll's claws and the hilly area between the Spires representing 

                the pads of the gnoll's paw. </font></p>

                xp and loot; just enough downtime between spawns to stay healthy 

                and mana-happy; minimal danger of wandering MoBs and trains; and 

                close proximity to the Splitpaw zone entrance for those rare instances

                    Spire,&quot; and &quot;North Spire.&quot; Quick use of your 

                    Sense Heading skill will show you which is which or, if you 

                    are standing at the Splitpaw entrance (it is a hole carved 

                    into the side of a small hill in the middle of the Spires) 

                    facing away from the entrance, the South Spire is to your 

                    right, the Middle Spire is directly ahead of you, and the

                    Spires increase in difficulty as one goes from South to Middle 

                    to North. Only one gnoll spawns at the South Spire (every 

                    6-10 minutes or so). The Middle Spire has a slightly faster 

                    spawn rate and a small chance that two gnolls will spawn. 

                    The North Spire spawns alternate between the standard static 

                    gnoll and a pair of gnolls that start to run as soon as they 

                    spawn. The runners briefly split apart (heading in opposite 

                    ways), then come back together in front of the North Spire 

                    before heading, in tandem, counter-clockwise away from that 

                    Spire.</font></p>

                    the three Spires is relatively easy - stand with your back 

                    to a Spire, walk about fifty paces, and turn around. Once 

                    the gnoll(s) spawn, pull and kill as you prefer, and as best 

                    suits your group's makeup. The three-member Strike Force generally 

                    used the &quot;root-&amp;-shoot&quot; method: the ranger would 

                    Root the gnoll, the ranger and druid would slap DoTs on the 

                    gnoll, and then everyone would throw in a DD or bow-shot. 

                    By the time the Root broke, the gnoll would be around half-strength 

                    and would not take long to eliminate. As long as one party 

                    member can keep an eye on the spawn, the other members can 

                    meditate and heal up for the next spawn.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 

                    &quot;Ledge&quot; (the Strike Force's home-away-from-home 

                    from levels 30 to 35) is the fourth, and hardest, camping 

                    spot at the Spires. To find the Ledge, stand directly in front 

                    of the Splitpaw cave entrance, facing the entrance, and look 

                    toward &quot;one o'clock&quot; (you will be facing Northwest). 

                    You will see a flat plateau, with a hill rising to its left 

                    and a downward slope falling away to its right. If no one 

                    is camping the Ledge, you will also see a lone gnoll staring 

                    right/North.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 

                    Ledge generally has two types of spawns: a single static gnoll, 

                    and a gnoll that starts running North (downhill) as soon as 

                    it spawns. Every so often, the Ledge will spawn two static 

                    gnolls right on top of each other. The Ledge also gives you 

                    an excellent vantage point from which to pull the pair of 

                    runners that spawn at the North Spire - those runners move 

                    clockwise around the Spires until they get behind the Middle 

                    Spire, and then they climb the hill to the left of the Ledge. 

                    Thus, from the Ledge, you can pull the runners either when 

                    they are coming around the corner from the North Spire (if 

                    you are looking North, you will see them) or when they have 

                    come to rest atop the hill. Moreover, if you wait the runners 

                    out after they climb the hill, they eventually will separate 

                    from each other and you can pick them off individually.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 

                    Ledge can be camped from two places. Most groups stay on the 

                    flat ground about fifty paces to the North of the Ledge, and 

                    pull the gnolls down to them. The Strike Force, however, opts 

                    to camp on the Ledge itself. We take positions on the southern 

                    edge of the Ledge (the side closest to the Splitpaw zone entrance), 

                    facing North-Northwest, and deal with the gnolls from there. 

                    This high ground gives us an excellent vantage point over 

                    the entire Spire area - we can see when a Spire is abandoned 

                    (and then pull spawns from there to the Ledge), we can spot 

                    the North Spire runners as they sprint around the Spires, 

                    and we are close enough to the Ledge spawns that &quot;unintentional&quot; 

                    KSing from us (along the &quot;Oh, didn't know you were camping 

                    that spawn&quot; type) is impossible. Most importantly, the 

                    Ledge is extremely close to the Splitpaw zone; because the 

                    Ledge is the one place at the Spires where you might encounter 

                    a &quot;mini-train&quot; of sorts, we recommend that you stay 

                    as close as possible to the zone entrance.</font></p>

                  <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We 

                    advise progressing through the Spires (from South to North) 

                    and then to the Ledge as you level from 25 to 35. Do not progress 

                    through these steps too quickly, as your inability to hold 

                    down a camp (particularly the North Spire runners) can wreak 

                    havoc for every other Spire group. At 25, the three-member 

                    Strike Force had all it could handle with the single static 

                    South Spire gnoll spawn. By 30, we could camp any of the three 

                    Spires without danger, but the Ledge still presented a real 

                    challenge (especially when a North Spire group could not handle 

                    the pair of runners). By the time we left the Ledge at 35, 

                    we could effectively handle both the Ledge <u>and</u> any 

                    &quot;extra&quot; spawn that we could pull from any of the 

                    three Spires.</font></p>

                    final note on the four Spire camps: they seem to attract an 

                    inordinate number of soloing Druids (usually in Wolf Form) 

                    who kill by kiting. As such, just because a Spire (or the 

                    Ledge) appears to be uncamped does not mean that it truly 

                    is vacant. We generally wait a few minutes (or until the next 

                    spawn) to ensure that the camp is &quot;ours&quot; before 

                    settling in.</font></p>

                    Like gnolls that you might previously have fought in BlackBurrow

                    you come within range, especially if you are engaged in a 

                    melee with another gnoll. Like those other gnolls, the Tesch 

                    Mas variety also will turn tail and try to run once you have

                    of about 4 plat. About one in three gnolls will wield Fine 

                    Steel weapons - although these gnolls hit harder than their 

                    unarmed counterparts, each FS weapon brings about 6 plat from

                    that it does not bring great value from merchants and, thus, 

                    you have to lug it out of the zone and go through the time-consuming 

                    auction value to maximize its cash value. We sold these items

                    but will say that the Karana's Tear quest simply requires 

                    you to give all four scrolls to a Qeynos NPC, who hands you 

                    xp and the Karana's Tear earring (+5 Sta). The Gem Inlaid 

                    Gauntlets quest requires several cross-continental journeys 

                    and interactions with NPCs, but results in an excellent piece 

                    of armor usable by all races and classes: AC8, Dex +3, Sta 

                    +3. Players often place the Gem Inlaid Gauntlets in the same 

                    value category as Treant Fists and Lupine Claw Gauntlets. 

                    We have been able to sell Gem Inlaid Gauntlets for between 

                    350 and 500 plat, adding a whole new profit tier to the Spires. 

                    The gloves are Lore, though, so you can only quest for (and 

                    auction) one at a time. </font></p>

                of the best features of the Spires is that it attracts very few 

                wandering MoBs. Lions, Mist Wolves, and Shadow Wolves occasionally 

                will wander about, and might even aggro on you, but do not pose 

                much of a threat to a group powerful enough to camp the Spires. 

                Similarly, you will see the odd Splitpaw Gnoll and Escaped Splitpaw 

                Gnoll; these gnolls are much less fearsome than their Tesch Mas 

                counterparts (apparently, the Tesch Mas and their cohorts have 

                evicted the Splitpaw gnolls from their former lair) and will not 

                put a strain on your group.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Various 

                centaurs (and, less frequently, aviaks) also roam around the Spires 

                area, but these MoBs do not aggro unless provoked and, given the 

                plentiful hunting at the Spires, the Strike Force never saw a 

                need to provoke them. Aviak Avocets will give you xp all the way 

                to 35, but they are tough to kill and their drops are not worth 

                the hassle.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There 

                is one wandering MoB that paths through the Spires and will both 

                aggro on you and pose a problem for you: the Undead Cyclops (and, 

                very rarely, a still-living Cyclops). The Undead Cyclops has a 

                lot of HPs, hits hard, and does not carry valuable drops. Fortunately, 

                you almost always can tell when the &quot;UC&quot; is coming: 

                not only is it large enough for you to spot from far away, but 

                players in SK tend to shout out its location as it roams around 

                the zone. If you are healthy and mana-happy, con it and take a 

                crack at it; if not, just avoid it and let it walk past you.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Remember, 

                the Splitpaw zone is always just a few seconds away, especially 

                if you are SoWed. If the Undead Cyclops proves to be too much 

                to handle, or in the rare event that you encounter a swarm of 

                Tesch Mas gnolls, zone into Splitpaw, heal up, and zone back. 

                More often than not, your camp site still will be free.</font></p>

                patience that it requires. We have found that committing to this 

                strategy is well worth the trouble: one rare drop is the difference 

                between a good day at the Spires and a GREAT one.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To 

                effectively &quot;Track-n'-Whack,&quot; you really only need two 

                skills in your party (beyond the ability to kill whatever MoB 

                you engage): tracking (to find the MoBs) and the Spirit of the 

                Wolf spell (to catch them, especially the key named MoBs which, 

                as noted below, often travel at SoW speed). Druids have both of 

                these key skills but, because a Ranger's tracking skill is far 

                better than any Druid's, we strongly advise having a Ranger to 

                serve as the group's tracker. This is not to say, however, that 

                a Druid's tracking skills are redundant: in certain cases, a rare 

                MoB will show up on the Druid's short-range track <u>before</u> 

                it shows up on the Ranger's screen. Thus, even if you have a Ranger 

                tracking, it can pay off to have your group's Druid keep an eye 

                on track as well.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once 

                these steps have been taken, all that remains is for the tracker 

                to <b>constantly</b> hit Track and keep an eye out for named MoBs 

                (see below for a handy guide to SK's named denizens). Indeed, 

                the Strike Force's Ranger even tracks <u>during</u> gnoll battles 

                - the named MoBs are so rare and valuable (and the Tesch Mas gnolls 

                so easy to kill, root, etc.) that our Ranger is under strict orders 

                to activate his &quot;Rare MoB on track&quot; hotkey even if a 

                gnoll was just pulled.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once 

                a named MoB spawns, the steps to take are obvious: the tracker 

                hits his &quot;Rare on track&quot; hotkey; the other group members 

                hit their /follow and &quot;Good to go&quot; hotkeys in quick 

                succession; and, when all members have sounded in, the tracker 

                takes off after the named MoB, towing his group members behind 

                him (and, if possible, letting the rest of the group in on the 

                identity of the target).</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 

                tracker will almost always be the first character to get a visual 

                fix on the target. When he does, his job is to check (and inform 

                the group of) the target's /consider and engagement status. For 

                the /consider status, a simple &quot;Blue&quot; or &quot;Yellow&quot; 

                will do. There is no need to inform the group that a MoB has not 

                yet been engaged; if, however, the MoB currently is being fought, 

                the tracker should inform the group (to prevent inadvertent kill-stealing) 

                and bring the chase to a halt. In this situation, we advise remaining 

                very close to the fight - if the group fighting the MoB flees 

                or dies, you will have first dibs on an already-damaged MoB.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Assuming 

                that the MoB is not previously engaged, the tracker should pull 

                the MoB to the group as quickly as possible. We have found that 

                a bow-shot from our Ranger is the fastest way to engage a named 

                MoB: our Ranger can hit from far away and, most importantly, without 

                stopping his sprint toward the target. If you are competing for 

                the MoB with another group, a split-second could make all the 

                difference between nabbing a rare drop and watching another group 

                enrich themselves at your expense.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once 

                the MoB is beaten and looted, the group members should reform 

                their marching order (again, hotkeys make this easy) and instruct 

                the tracker to head back to their vacated Spires camp site. Even 

                if the named Mob ran you all over SK, there is an easy way to 

                get back to the Spires: the tracker will almost always be able 

                to track to a Tesch Mas gnoll and, thus, the Spires, from the 

                spot of your battle. With a little luck, your spot at the Spires 

                will still be open and you'll be able to resume your gnoll slaughter, 

                hopefully with a new rare drop in hand.</font></p>

                close this Guide with a few words on one final way to make some 

                cash while camping the Spires: hiring your tracking skills out. 

                Although, in theory, a character might be willing to pay for the 

                location of <i>any</i> named SK MoB, only two such MoBs in our 

                experience have ever catalyzed characters to actually send zone-wide 

                shouts offering plat in exchange for the location of (and/or looting 

                rights to) the spawn: Brother Qwinn and Quillmane&#9;. If you 

                do see a message like this come across your screen, be sure to 

                write down the auctioning character's name so that, in the inevitable 

                rush that starts when your track shows the right rare, you will 

                remember who wants to pay you.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Brother 

                Qwinn</b>, a 60+ NPC, is part of a Monk quest and has a very uneven 

                spawn schedule. Sometimes he is up for a whole day, but sometimes 

                you can go several days straight without ever tracking him. We 

                have seen desperate Monks offer as much as 500 plat for Qwinn's 

                location. We recommend that, if you track him, you send the tracker 

                in pursuit to get the /loc, and use another group member to ask 

                the zone if anyone is searching for Qwinn (or to send a /tell 

                to any character that previously had offered plat for the /loc). 

                We advise not divulging Qwinn's /loc, or even the name of your 

                group's tracker, until the buyer pays in full.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Quillmane</b> 

                is a more complex matter, because high-level Mages looking to 

                complete their epic weapon quest could care less about most Quillmane 

                spawns - as noted above, the Pegasus Feather Cloak drops no more 

                than 25% of the time from Quillmane. We have, however, seen Mages 

                offer up to 5,000 plat for looting rights to the Cloak, and have 

                heard of offers up to 10,000 plat in value. That is a lot of cash 

                for the mere use of your tracking skill!</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of 

                course, there is no way to tell what Quillmane will drop until 

                he is slain, and the No Drop nature of the Cloak makes it impossible 

                to just loot and sell it. Accordingly, if you are looking to sell 

                looting rights, we advise that you NEVER let on that you are tracking 

                Quillmane until it lies dead at your feet. Then, carefully right-click 

                on Quill's corpse - if you see the Cloak icon, be extra-careful 

                not to put your cursor anywhere near it. Have one group member 

                keep a right-click on the corpse (to prevent ninja looting) and 

                have another member do the auctioning. We advise proceeding in 

                three steps: (1) first, send /tells to any Mages who previously 

                stated their interest in the Cloak; (2) then, do a /who Magician 

                to identify the Mages in the zone, and then send them /tells asking 

                if they are interested; and (3) finally, do a zone-wide /shout 

                asking if anyone wants to purchase looting rights to the Pegasus 

                Cloak.</font></p>

              <p><font size="2" color="ffffff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whatever 

                you do, do <b>not</b> spend more than five (or so) minutes auctioning 

                the Cloak - like any corpse, Quillmane's corpse eventually will 

                disappear, and you certainly do not want to be left empty-handed. 

                We suggest that you accept no less than 5,000 plat for looting 

                rights - your potential customers will be high-level Mages who 

                quite literally have nothing better to spend their money on.</font></p>
