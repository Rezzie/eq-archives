The Wood Elf Bard&#146;s Essential Guide to Combat, Levels 1-9</b></font></p>

<p align="CENTER">Written by Nafai, Veeshan Server</p>

<p align="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>

<p></font><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wood Elf is my favored
race for a bard, as their bonuses give the bard just what he needs to be really useful. It
allows you to start in Kelethin, where virtually every song is located, and is quicker
than the half-elf. The Humans have the worst of the starting stats for a bard, but get no
race penalties for experience.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In combat, the key is the DGH
principal, which is the Law of the Essential Guide to Combat for any race and class:
Don&#146;t Get Hit. If you don&#146;t get hit by the enemy, you have all the time in the
world to do the nifty little tricks that your race and class have to eliminate the enemy.
Again, if you have chosen the wood elf, you are already in the right ballpark for agility.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although this guide is written
with levels 1-9 in mind, the tactics (especially those described under Selo&#146;s
Accelerando concerning fast equips) are useful to all bards.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, now at each step of the way,
you will be daunted with the confusing option set to you&#151;am I combat oriented or
spell oriented? No other class is so good at both, so if you learn to balance these two
early on, you will be a much desired bard indeed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I prefer 1H Slashing weapons,
especially the Minotaur Battle Axe for these levels. This way you can also carry a shield,
and still crank out good damage. I also carry around throwing daggers with me, as an
optional way of drawing monsters towards you. Until you get songs that attack single
monsters, a throwing weapon is a good way to ensure that you get one hit in before they
do, and any hit that you can get in that you can guarantee that you Can&#146;t Get Hit
immediately afterwards falls into the DGH principle.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, learn to juggle early on
and juggle your songs anytime you are in combat, even if one doesn&#146;t have a huge
effect&#151;the practice will be invaluable. Juggling is the method of having the effects
of two songs going at once. Song effects last a few seconds after you stop singing them,
giving you time to fire another one off, stopping it after you see the effect start, going
back to the original song, etc. This can be done with 2 songs reliably, and occasionally a
third can be thrown in, although it is extremely rare for all three effects to be active
at the same time.<br>
</font></p>

<hr>

<p><br>
<font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, let&#146;s discuss the specific
use of songs to <i>supplement</i> your physical combat. Again, this section will cover the
use of your songs when you have your favorite weapon, not an instrument, equipped. We will
get to instruments later. Also keep in mind that my song analysis is for combat only. Many
of these songs have totally different uses out of combat, which are not covered here.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Chant of Battle +AC +Strength</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From levels 1-9, this song should
always be on in combat. It effects the entire party, and when juggled with another song,
it often adds enough of a buffer to end the battle quicker and taking less damage. This
song will also give you the edge at the lowest levels (1-5) to take stronger monsters than
other classes at your level, helping you to level up quicker.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Chords of Dissonance Damage NPC up to 30&#146; Range</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This song is dangerous, and is
unfortunately avoided by most. As a result, there is an entire short section on Chords of
Dissonance towards the end of this guide. Take the strategies from there and incorporate
them into your combat knowledge.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Jaxan&#146;s Jig o&#146; Vigor +Stamina</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jaxan&#146;s Jig could be
considered one of the weaker songs in a bard&#146;s repertoire, but especially from levels
1-5, it allows you to stay in battle longer than most would, again allowing you to chip
away at harder enemies. Consider juggling this song with Chant of Battle. An individual or
a party that has +AC, +Strength, and +Stamina makes for a difficult opponent for the
baddies on Norrath. </font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Lyssa&#146;s Locating Corpse Corpse Find</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Obviously no combat use
whatsoever</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Selo&#146;s Accelerando Running&#133;..FAST also
lowers Stamina Loss</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Running is an often overlooked
component to combat. Sometimes you get in over your head, or get ransacked by 6 orc
oracles. Or perhaps you really want to take a crack at that isolated Slaver. Having this
song not only allows you to stay in a battle longer (instead of trying to run away when
you have only 3 bubbles of life like most other classes, you can run away at 2 and lower),
but therefore allows you to try monsters that you otherwise wouldn&#146;t. Don&#146;t use
this song during combat, juggle some other songs that help you fight, but when you foresee
your death, or see a few legionnaires running towards your skirmish, tuck tail, click the
little boot that is Selo's Accelerando and high tail it out of there. If you have a drum,
and quickly equip it, nothing can catch you.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The problem is&#151;how do I
equip the drum quick enough while I&#146;m running away? Well, a little known trick is
that your inventory slots, as well as your equipment slots can be pasted as hotkeys just
like your skills can. This keeps you from having to switch to your inventory screen to
equip the drum. Even with a shield, I can change to my drum with the following sequence:
Shift-1, click click click click. And my free hand is holding the up arrow, already
running away. It takes about 3 seconds to switch. The secret is to know how to setup the
hotkey page (I keep it on 1 as it&#146;s the closest number to the shift key and the
easiest to reach when panicking.) The top two slots should be the Left Hand and Right Hand
from your equipment screen, and the bottom four are simply the last 4 slots in your
inventory window. To make this work you need to keep those slots in your inventory free of
everything but your drum (or other instruments.) You HAVE to have enough empty spots to
put your weapon and shield in. So keep at least 2 backpacks and never let anything get put
in those slots when you loot, or you&#146;ll be wondering if it&#146;s worth it to drop
that cracked staff that&#146;s worth 1 plat to free up a slot to drop your weapon into.
Avoid this by keeping those inventory slots empty. A small sacrifice for 5 seconds to
freedom.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Hymn of Restoration Heal Party</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hymn of Restoration is a pulsing
song, meaning that it&#146;s not a continuing effect, but pulses every few seconds healing
you a few hit points. This means that it&#146;s probably not a good idea to juggle it, as
you will lose a lot of it&#146;s effectiveness. If you know that a battle is going to be
rough, either for you alone or in a group, consider keeping this song on the whole time to
help avoid damage and increase the amount of time your party (or yourself if soloing) can
spend in battle. However, if you are level 7 and soloing, you will probably always want to
juggle other songs (namely Jonathon&#146;s Whistling Warsong and Chant of Battle) while in
battle, and sing this song in-between battles to get your health back up.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Jonathon&#146;s Whistling Warsong +Strength +AC</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This song is donned as the Chant
of Battle upgrade, but really is a different song. First off, it effects only you, the
bard, and secondly the effects can be layered, so by juggling Chant of Battle with this
song you become a veritable force. It also helps follow the principle of DGH. A lot of
bards out there will tell you, &quot;no, just use Hymn of Restoration in battle&#151;the
other songs are negligible.&quot; This could not be further from the truth. Why do you
need to heal if you give them no chance to hit you? If I am in a party that is weak on
tanks, I still juggle these songs occasionally. The Chant of Battle helps out the others,
and they have already cast buffer spells on all of us, and it makes you a pretty decent
tank. It is most useful when soloing though, as it needs no instrument have its full
effect, so hack away!</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Kelin&#146;s Lugrubious Lament Causes Sadness</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kelin&#146;s Lament is the most
efficient way for a bard to single out an enemy from a group. Whether on your own or with
friends, cast this song on every enemy that you don&#146;t want to attack and then draw
one of them out away from the saddened party of monsters. This song keeps singing for a
few moments after it effects your target, but does nothing during that time, so as soon as
you see it effect your target (make sure it didn&#146;t resist) cancel it and start it
again on your next target. Practice with this song on weaker groups before trying it on
higher level monsters.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Elemental Rhythms +Resistance to Fire, Cold, and
Magic</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contrary to popular belief, the
magic resistance songs are <i>not</i> broken and are very useful. Juggle this song with
another favorite when fighting oracles, shamans, and wizards, as well as drakes and
harpies (fire resistance.) At level 9, this song is a little weak to count on for
consistency, but it helps nonetheless. I must say that it has saved me a number of times
from Crushbone minions trying to cast root on me so they can gang up on me. It&#146;s
great to juggle with Selo&#146;s Accelerando if you are running away from magic enemies as
well, as the percussion instrument only makes it that much more powerful!<br>
</font></p>

<hr>

<p><br>
<font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we will consider the other side
of the coin: Singing whilst holding an instrument instead of a weapon, otherwise known as,
the support bard.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a well rounded group, you will
already have tanks and physical damagers. Therefore a bard can many times be the most
useful when taking a support role, just outside the heat of the battle, but benefiting
from much more powerful songs that instruments allow. You can also then act as the
&quot;battle coordinator.&quot; By not being right in the thick of it, you can pay
attention to each party member&#146;s energy as well as the monster(s) and issue
suggestions and adjust your songs accordingly. There really are only two other times that
I recommend using instruments and those are (A) non-combat, such as putting the lute on to
heal the party faster, and (B) using Chords of Dissonance when soloing, as described at
the end of this guide.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Songs take on entirely
different roles when you are not fighting yourself, so they will each be discussed again
here. Also, don&#146;t be afraid to lend a quick hand with your hand-to-hand combat toward
the end of the battle&#151;you still keep singing with the equipped instrument.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Chant of Battle Percussion</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This song receives increased
effect from use with a percussion instrument.&nbsp; This song is still effective at these
levels, and until level 10 when you get Anthem de Arms, it is a very useful party song.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Chords of Dissonance Stringed</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, this song is so special
cased that I will not describe it here. <i>Please</i> read the section at the end of this
guide to see how it can be used in both fighting and supporting roles</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Jaxan&#146;s Jig o&#146; Vigor Percussion</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singing this with percussion
instrument causes you to regenerate your parties stamina more quickly.&nbsp; Just tell
your party members to let you know when their stamina is decreasing too much, then kick
this song on assist them. Also, this song is great to juggle with Selo&#146;s Accelerando
when you need to make swimming getaways (underwater, Selo&#146;s Accelerando doesn&#146;t
negate your stamina loss by itself)&#151;your stamina hardly drops at all and your speed
underwater is unmatched.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Lyssa&#146;s Locating Lyric No Instrument</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, no combat use</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Selo&#146;s Accelerando Percussion</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use as described earlier, but in
this role, you have the added bonus of probably already having the drum equipped anyway.
Still, make sure you have quick access between your drum and stringed instrument (levels 8
and 9 only.)</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Hymn of Restoration Stringed</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Available to you at level 8 are
stringed instruments, so make sure you spend one practice point in them when you turn
level 8, otherwise your skill won&#146;t go up. In combat, when it gets very questionable
as to the direction the battle is turning, Hymn of Restoration with a stringed instrument
can turn the tides. It almost doubles it&#146;s effectiveness each tick when you use a
stringed instrument, making it very powerful. This is great if everyone in your party is
getting hit hard, and your magic users are staying busy using mana on attack spells. If
only one person is taking the brunt of the battle, consider having a magic user heal them
and keep singing the combat enhancing songs. This is best used in-between combat with a
stringed instrument to decrease the waiting time you need to jump into a good fray again.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Jonathon&#146;s Whistling Warsong No Instrument</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This song is pretty useless in a
group where you aren&#146;t responsible for the majority of the fighting, therefore use it
sparingly, if at all, as it doesn&#146;t even need an instrument.</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Kelin&#146;s Lugubrious Lament No Instrument</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the same way as described
above</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Elemental Rhythms Percussion</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, perfect to juggle with
Chant of Battle when fighting magic using enemies and drakes and harpies. It&#146;s best
use is when the group needs to outrun a Goblin Shaman or something similar, in which case
juggle it with Selo&#146;s Accelerando which also uses percussion.<br>
</font></p>

<hr>

<p><br>
<font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Ok, now the part you&#146;ve been waiting for:</font></p>
<b>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">How to Use Chords of Dissonance Effectively, and Not
Die</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a great song. I cannot
emphasize that enough. Whether soloing, or in a group, this is simply a great song. It
only does like 7 points of damage, maybe even less, per&nbsp; tick, and it has no morality
in its attacking. It will hit EVERYONE around you within 30 feet, including players
(won&#146;t hurt them unless you and they are PK) and guards and merchants and the Pixie
Guard that happens to be wandering by, etc. Therefore, most bards avoid it because it is
frequently akin to hanging yourself---unless you are very careful.</font></p>

<p><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">A few simple rules:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Don&#146;t use CoD (Chords of Dissonance) when you
    don&#146;t know EVERTHING that is within the attack range</font></li>
  <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Don&#146;t use CoD when you don&#146;t want
    everything that you noted in step one to attack you all at once</font></li>
  <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Never EVER use it in towns</font></li>
  <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Think very hard before using it in dungeons</font></li>
  <li><font face="Book Antiqua" size="3">Get in the habit of turning it off IMMEDIATELY after
    you are done using it</font></li>
