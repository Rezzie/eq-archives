<P>If this creature even exists, most would argue
        it lives between the Planes, in the Great Void, leaving
        this place only to hunt. But since no mortal can survive
        that void, the location of the beast's lair must remain
        unproven. Legend says the magical creature teleports to
        its prey at night, stinging and poisoning with its
        tentacles. The victim, still able to slowly move, becomes
        then the toy of this feline monster, and eventually, of
        course, its meal.
