<P>Burrowing
        through the very crust of Norrath in search of prey, the
        Skulking Brute is a creature of unrelenting hunger. Many
        brave adventurers have fallen beneath a Brute's onslaught
        of hammering fists and gnashing teeth. From where the
        Skulking Brutes originate is unknown but rumors abound.
        Some say they are the creation of a mad Erudite wizard
        while others claim they were made by Brell Serilis
        himself. On one point all can agree: it is best to be
        where a Skulking Brute isn't.
