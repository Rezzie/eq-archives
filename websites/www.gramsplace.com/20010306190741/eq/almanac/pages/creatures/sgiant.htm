<P>Of the myriad of giants that dwell in Norrath,
        Sand Giants are perhaps the most curious. They, unlike
        other giant-kin, are nomadic and dwell almost always in
        the desert or other dry and dusty locales. And while they
        are not overtly evil in their nature (one would never
        find Sand Giants raiding towns or other civilized areas),
        they are fiercely xenophobic. Their distrust of other
        races borders on the paranoid and many adventurers have
        sealed their fates in death by accidentally coming across
        a Sand Giant settlement while exploring. The fact that
        these settlements move and could be anywhere makes desert
        questing all the more perilous.
