<P>Sharing the Plane of
        Sky with the great dragons and drakes, the djinn are
        mages of immense power. But while they are both
        intelligent and strong willed, they all possess an
        unexplained and curious weakness -- experienced wizards
        and sorcerers of Norrath have been known to summon them
        from their native plane and imprison them in sealed rooms
        and smaller devices. Some legends speak of fantastic
        rewards for those who release a djinn, yet others speak
        of the violent deaths of those who unleash them.
