<P>Wyverns are distant cousins of dragons, somewhat
        similar in appearance, yet smaller and usually armless.
        While more intelligent than most creatures, they are far
        from possessing the intellect of their draconian kin.
        Wyverns are mute and merely fierce fighters, unlike
        dragons, which are capable of speech and even sorcery.
