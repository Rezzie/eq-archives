<P>The stench of rot surrounds the lair of a Plague Dragon and
        woe to any who stumble upon one uninvited. Pray that the
        dragon dissects you with talons and teeth, for if you are
        exposed to its breath your demise will be slow and
        excruciatingly painful. Your flesh will blacken and
        blister until it slides free from your bones. Yes, you'll
        find yourself wishing for a quick death by claw or fang.
