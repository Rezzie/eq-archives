<P>Carved from stone and
        then animated by powerful magic, the gargoyle is a
        fearsome foe indeed. Often mistaken for statues until
        it's too late, gargoyles will strike suddenly. Their skin
        being virtually impenetrable, combined with their ability
        to fly, makes them almost impossible to damage much less
        hit at all.
