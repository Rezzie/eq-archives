<h1><center>Gram's Place EQ Classes.</center></h1>

<hr>
<p><b>Warrior - </b>Warriors are the masters of armed combat, in
all its many forms. They are at home on the battlefield, and are
trained to take punishment as much as dole it out, so their Hit
Points are the highest of any class. </p>

<p><b>Cleric - </b>The Cleric is a holy man endowed by his patron
deity with the power to heal, and, to a lesser extent, call upon
the wrath of his deity to smite his foes. Prayer is how the
Cleric gains his ability.</p>

<p><b>Paladin - </b>Paladins are the very picture of a holy
knight, fighting for the cause of good in all aspects of his
life. They share some of the power of a Cleric, and a good deal
of the fighting ability of a Warrior, but have a few powers all
their own. </p>

<p><b>Ranger - </b>The Ranger is a meld between a Warrior and a
Druid, sharing some of the skills of both. They are at home in
the outdoors.</p>

<p><b>Shadow Knight - </b>The evil twin to the Paladin class,
Shadow Knights derive all of their powers from the evil gods whom
they serve. They are a meld of Warrior and Necromancer, and share
some of their abilities and spells. </p>

<p><b>Druid - </b>A Druid is completely at home in the outdoors,
and is a friend to all animals. Because of this, no animal will
ever attack him unless first attacked by the Druid. They are
spellcasters whose focus is all things natural, allowing them to
call upon nature for aid. They share some woodland skills with
their Ranger brothers.</p>

<p><b>Monk - </b>Monks are dedicated to the pursuit of shaping
their bodies into a pure weapon, and because of this they nearly
shun all weapons and most forms of armor. They are very religious
as well, and the gods are known to bless them, not by prayers and
spells, but by magically enhancing their attacks.</p>

<p><b>Bard - </b>The Bard&#146;s stock-in-trade is his ability to
play songs. His songs are actually spells of a sort, and their
magical affects last as long as the Bard continues to sing and
play the correct instrument. They have some passing knowledge of
the Warrior ways (mainly for self-defense), but their main focus
is always their art, and so they will never be as skillful as
Warriors.</p>

<p><b>Rogue - </b>They are the secretive, mysterious class of the
world, who sneak about in the dark. Some say they are assassins,
and some that they are nothing but common thieves, but the truth
lies somewhere in the middle, and they are capable of both. They
are quite skilled with many weapons, but they cannot stand toe to
toe with a Warrior and prefer to make the kill by a sudden attack
from the rear, at which they are extremely skilled. They would
much prefer to not be discovered at all, or if they are, to not
be there for their opponent&#146;s blow to land. The darker
skills of picking locks and stealing are also their forte.</p>

<p><b>Shaman - </b>They are similar to the Cleric, but are more
of a tribal witch doctor and are typically found amongst the more
primitve races. Their primary focus is largely healing and other
Clerical type spells, but they also have a good deal of offensive
spells.</p>

<p><b>Necromancer - </b>These are the dark brotherhood of the
arcane arts, dabbling in death. Through evil spiritually based
spells, they are able to animate dead bodies and skeletons to do
their bidding, as well as having spells which leach life from
their victims. </p>

<p><b>Wizard - </b>Wizards are the master seekers of knowledge,
and their talents and spells are focused on this goal. They use
powerful spells to not only see things from afar, but to
transport them there as well. This thirst for arcane knowledge
has also made them the true masters of the strongest form of
defense: offensive spells of pure destruction. In their ability
to do magical damage, they have no rivals.</p>

<p><b>Magician - </b>Magicians are the summoners of the arcane
arts, and wield the power to call forth everything from a loaf of
bread to a huge Fire Elemental to fight for them. While not as
adept at offensive spells as the Wizards, Magicians still wield
considerable power in this area as well.</p>

<p><b>Enchanter - </b>The primary focus of the Enchanter&#146;s
art can be summed up by the name of the arcane order to which he
belongs: Enchanter. Their spells are crafted to enchant people,
places, and things. This art allows them to charm beings and make
them fight for their new master, or magically enhance the
capabilities of a sword. They also have some skill in offensive
spells, but are never as skilled as a Wizard.</p>
