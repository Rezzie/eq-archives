<P>Step carefully in the
        swamps of Norrath for they are the domain of the
        Frogloks. Decades of slavery and persecution have
        hardened these once timid amphibious creatures into
        fierce guerrilla warriors. Many Troll war parties have
        fallen to swift and vicious Froglok ambushes. However, if
        treated with respect and well being, the Frogloks can be
        the greatest ally an adventurer can have while traveling
        the dangerous swamplands of Norrath.
