<h1><center>Gram's Place EQ Almanac.</center></h1>

<hr>
<P>Ok...  I had to start somewhere, so I took everything from the EQ Site (Just like everyone else did).
<P>I'll be fleshing this area out a bit, and adding some original content soon enough.
<P>Until then, the only original bit is the menu on the left, and the layout.  
<P>Click around...  The Atlas, Equip, Skills and Magic aren't done yet, but everything else is.
