<P>Several of these
        small, burly, creatures have been spotted deep in the
        caverns beneath Kaladim, lurking about in the shadows,
        and stalking the mining crews. Many a Dwarven Miner's
        disappearance has been attributed to these foul beings,
        whose only fear seems to be bright light. Rumor has it
        that these creatures may actually be Dwarves -- perhaps
        even the missing Miners -- that were bitten by strange
        bats that live in the deep mines and caverns, inflicting
        their victims with the curse of Lycanthropy. Or, maybe
        the sharp claws and long, dripping, fangs of the Werebats
        themselves are responsible for this curse.
