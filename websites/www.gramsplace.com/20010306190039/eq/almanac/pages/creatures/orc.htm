<P>Bred by the gods for
        battle, Orcs are single-minded in their desire for
        conquest. They abuse the weak and quickly cower beneath
        the strong. Ideas and objects unrelated to war have no
        value to an Orc. They are the mortal enemies of Dwarves
        and Elves, and seek to slay them whenever possible.
