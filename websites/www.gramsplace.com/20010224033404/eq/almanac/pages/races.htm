<h1><center>Gram's Place EQ Races.</center></h1>

<hr>
<p><b>Human - </b>Normal humans. The standard race by which all
others are judged.</p>

<p><b>Barbarian - </b>A hardier variety of the Human race that
comes from the cold and rugged northlands. Because of the harsh
environment, and their warlike culture, they are better suited to
being Warriors than Humans, and are generally unwashed and rugged
&#150; possessing very few social graces. </p>

<p><b>Erudite (High Man) - </b>The final variant of the Human
race. Being the exact opposite of the Barbarians, the High Man
prides himself on his intellectual abilities and social graces,
to the almost total exclusion of the physical disciplines.</p>

<p><b>Woodland Elf - </b>The Elves appear somewhat human at first
glance, but their very sharp features and pointed ears set them
apart. Elves are weaker than humans, but more than make up for
this with their amazing agility and superior dexterity. They
equal the High Man in their intelligence and wisdom, but are much
more fair and charismatic. </p>

<p><b>High Elf - </b>The High Elves are much more intellectual
than their Woodland kin, and are the &quot;royalty&quot; of the
Elven races (with the exception of their Dark brethren). They
share the appearance of their Woodland kin, but are thinner, more
beautiful, and more pale in skin. </p>

<p><b>Dark Elf - </b>The evil brethren of the Woodland and High
Elves. Their skin is blueish-black, their hair white, and they
share the pointed ears and sharp features of their Elven
brethren. Due to their life under the earth, and dedication to
evil gods, they have the ability to see perfectly in the dark .</p>

<p><b>Half-Elf - </b>Half-Elves, being a blend between humans and
Woodland Elves, share some of the strengths and weaknesses of
both races. They most closely resemble humans, except for their
slightly pointed ears and sharper facial features. </p>

<p><b>Dwarf - </b>Dwarves are short, but extremely strong (much
more so than Humans) and dexterous. They appear to be small,
burly humans, and are never seen without beards and mustaches. </p>

<p><b>Troll - </b>Trolls typically stand about 8&#146; tall, are
extremely strong, ugly, stupid, dirty, and green of skin. </p>

<p><b>Ogre - </b>Ogres are incredibly massive beings, with their
average height being about 10&#146;, and weigh well over four
hundred pounds, which makes them a truly immovable object. Due to
their size, they are the strongest of all the races and are tied
with the Trolls in pure Stamina. Conversely, they are the
stupidest race, whose lives mostly consist of smashing things and
eating them. </p>

<p><b>Halfling - </b>Halflings are stocky little people that most
closely resemble humans, but they are extremely agile, dexterous,
and very light of foot.</p>

<p><b>Gnome - </b>Gnomes spend most of their lives in their
underground burrows and rarely come to the surface. They resemble
Dwarves to some extent, but have a ruddy brown skin and are more
wiry and gnarled. Their hair is white, and somewhat sparse.</p>
