<P>Innoruk is a tall and twisted
        being who rules the Plane of Hate. There is no safety in
        his world, no open spaces, only dark alleys and dwellings
        inhabited by the nastiest of creatures, including
        powerful undead. Legend says Innoruk is the father of the
        Dark Elves.
