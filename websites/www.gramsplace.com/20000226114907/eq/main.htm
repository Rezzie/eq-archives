<P>Hail good readers...
<P>It's been a while since our last update.  I just received Shadoe's last chat log review, and as always, that has prompted me to chat with you a little.
<P>I've got to admit that I haven't been doing much with this site during the Closed Beta period...  If you read my old UO site, you will know that I primarily talked about in-game issues (when the server is down :).  At present, just about anything that I said would be speculation.
<P>As a result, I have been working hard on my own software, and spending time with my family, and business...  It's pretty nice, but there are definately times that I wish I could pull out a halbard :)
<P>As for EQ, it seems that they are moving along quite nicely.  There have been some new screenshots out, and they are SWEET!!!  I have not updated the local screenshots here, as just about every other EQ site out there reposts the public screenshots.
<P>I can't wait to get in and start testing :)
<P>Without further ado, here's Shadoe, and the most recent Chat Log with Brad...
</FONT>
<P><U><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">August Chat Log</FONT></U>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">By &lt;Shadoe></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">Well, it's that time of the month. No, not <I>THAT</I>
time of the month! It's time for the latest chat log review! I can't believe
you people!!</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">Anyway, let's just dive into the thick of it....</FONT>

<P>----------

<P>*** Aradune (bmcquaid@sisa15-35.sonyinteractive.com) has joined #everquest
<BR><I>&lt;Aradune> hello all</I>
<BR><I>&lt;Aradune> we'll begin in just a minute</I>
<BR><I>* Aradune reminds people not to message him directly, in that I
don't have time to answer individually.</I>
<BR>&lt;BlkStaff> ok you ready?
<BR>&lt;Relay1> No more nick changes as of now
<BR>&lt;BlkStaff> First off there will be some questions i gather'd off
of EQvault
<BR>&lt;BlkStaff> then we will go with Relays...
<BR>&lt;BlkStaff> Ok you can start messaging questions to Relays ... we
will start a back flow of questions
<BR><I>&lt;Aradune> ok, we're ready to begin</I>
<BR>&lt;BlkStaff> so we can jump right into the next part of the chat.
<BR><I>&lt;Aradune> I've got some of the EQ team with me today</I>
<BR><I>&lt;Btrost> Where? ;)</I>
<BR><I>&lt;Aradune> I've got our lead designer, Bill Trost here, and also
some of our world builders, Ryan and Hutch</I>
<BR><I>&lt;Aradune> say hi, guys</I>
<BR><I>&lt;The_Hutch> Greetings all</I>
<BR><I>&lt;Btrost> Hello Everyone. Thanks for showing up.</I>
<BR><I>&lt;_Mute_> heya all =)</I>
<BR><I>&lt;Aradune> alright, lets begin questions. i'll answer them, and
give a few of them to the other guys here</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> The switch is a good thing
to protect the newbies but only for newbies... why you don't set automatically
the switch on PK when the character as the 5th or 10 level ?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> because quite a few
people want to be able to play -pvp all the way to level 50 -- they don't
want to deal with pvp, and they have a right not to. remember, the only
thing the switch doesn't allow you to do is to kill people who don't want
to play that way.</I>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Stupid question...  Who syas that only newbies don't like being murdered for the hell of it?  Regardless of how strong of a character someone builds, it still sucks to have a group of idiots gang up and kill you because they are bored.  If it wasn't for the PK Aholes out there, there would be no need for the switch.  There are definately times where a good thumping is in order, and unfortunately the switch will allow idiots to act without impunity...  I hope that every PKer out there has a mob of -pvp taunting him every step of the way.
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> Since everyone is comparing
the Shaman to a Cleric, can you give us an idea about the offensive magic
capabilities that a Shaman has. Will it be more of the Wizard school or
the Magician school? Or just totally different?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Btrost> The shaman is more of
a tribal healer with his ablities being slightly more offense oriented
than the cleric...</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> there were some rumors that
there will be a name filter so you can't have names like that aren't fantasy
like names is this true?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> We will be limiting
names such that names must be unique and should be compatible with a fantasy
setting.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(Hmm... I wonder how they plan on enforcing this?
It's hard for me to believe they can program an AI to detect every permeation
of the words "CrAzY dOoD!" there is. Could it be they would have an actual
human sitting there day after day doing nothing but approving or rejecting
each new character name that crops up? That's not really feasible, either.
I guess we'll just have to wait and see.)</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
I'm not sure what I think about this one...  In UO, if someone gave themselves a jerkoff name, then you knew that they were an idiot.  It was a good first indicator of who the murders / thieves, and aholes were.
</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> <FONT COLOR="#000000">&lt;EQVBrd> Looking
on the world map on the EQ webpage i noticed that there were no names for
the seas surrounding the continents. Do they have names? Can you follow
the coastlines on small boats or is sea travel limited?</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"> <I>&lt;Aradune>
I just took a look at the maps on www.everquest.com and the oceans and
seas are named there. Most ocean travel is done on larger ships.</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000"></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> Will there be a map feature
showing where you have traveled in the dungeon that is automatic, or might
you be able to buy some type of map from a shop?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> We feel exploration
is key aspect of RPGs and feel an automap feature ruins this, as well as
limits the types of mazes and trap systems we can implement. As for buying
maps in shops, we aren't sure if this will make it in by ship or not.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(Brad's opinion about automapping is certainly
subjective. I don't think anything has to be ruined just by adding the
convenience of having your map being recorded by the computer as you explore,
rather than by pencil [or </FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">blood</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">,
if you're overzealous]. On the other hand, since automapping has become
such a standard in CRPGs, I have missed - to a degree - sitting down and
making my own map of areas on graph paper. It's funny how something so
knee bitingly tedious at the time could be so missed years later.)</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Eh...  Wait a few weeks, and there will be screencap maps out on every website. (Or at least mine :)...  Which first?  A world map, or Dungeon maps?)
</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> What type of emoting options
will we get? I noticed that in one of the screen shots it showed a bunch
of chars justraising their arms or sometin. Will we be able to do other
such things, stick out tongue, jump, stamp feet, etc
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> You can pretty much
emote anything you want, and then several of these emotes are attached
to in-game animations, such as waving, cheering, etc.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(We need animations for throwing up, I think.
That's all I want, just give me that!)</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
I recall in one of the earlier screenshots, the guy witht he two swords was kneeling...  Sweet :)
</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> Will the player who makes
the deathkill on a monster or opponent get first pick of the loot?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Yes.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(Hmmm... this is another thing I'm wondering
how they're going to implement. Will the rest of the party just be unable
to touch the corpse until the killing player is finished? If so, how will
the computer know when he/she is finished? I want answers, Spock!!)</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
No matter what they plan on doing, it will have limitations, and there will be folks that don't like the solution.  U guess the computer will know that the player is done when he closed the corpse window???
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> What school of magic will
a druid's/ranger's magic come from?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Btrost> They each have their
own spell lists and their powers differ greatly</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> How hard will it be for
me to get the cloth I want my character to use? Will I be able to pick
different clothes when I start my character? Style, color, etc?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Some items are easy
to get, some very hard -- depends on the item. And some items alter one's
appearance, and some don't.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> since enchanters can apparently
charm mobs, what kind of interface exists for controlling them? Can you
order them to do anything they noramlly can do? cast spells? equip items?
hold stuff for you? move a certain direction?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> You give them verbal
orders, which they will obey.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(Brad just keeps getting better and better at
dodging questions each month. I, for one, wouldn't mind ordering that shapely
Wood Elf female to -- *WHAP*...[at this point, Shadoe's wife knocked him
unconscious and we will never know what he was about to say. And there
was much rejoicing...])</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Heh, Serves you right :)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> Has Macro'ing your stats
using a program been succesfully eliminated so characters cannot become
gods in a night or so of macroing?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Btrost> We believe we have solutions
to the macroing problem..</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(Promises, promises.)</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> How much of a role do deities
play in EQ? Simply, will clerics and wizards learn different spells by
worshiping different gods; will they affect abilites somehow?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> at this time the diety
a cleric follows does not influence the spells he or she can cast.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> How close together must
a party of beings be in order to gain shared experience. That is, can a
party be scattered all over Norrath and still be sharing experience points
or do they have to be within a few screens or even view the act to gain
some of the experience?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> They have to be within
range of the combat. I don't know the exact number of feet, but you have
to be reasonably close. Now, you can still be in the group farther away,
but you don't get the share of exp.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> Spell failiure effects.....can
spells backfire and effect you of your party?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> spells can fail.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-("Like a Rock! Oooooooh, Like a Rock!".........
It's a Dodge commercial.... As in question dodging?.... Forget it.)</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> How much variety is there
in character dress?? and how much can we customize the color of armor and
clothing? Enough to beable to create fairly varyed guild colors or just
rather bland?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> There are several different
texture sets per character type (of which there are 24 -- 12 races x 2
genders) -- to change them, you find items, such as red dragon armor and
such. In EQ you don't arbitrarily change the color of your items -- the
color is based on the actual item.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(Am I the only one who's a teensy bit disappointed
at this? One thing UO does right is the ability to choose the color of
the shirt you're wearing. I know it's trivial, all things considered, but
it's something that I think kept me playing UO for as long as I did. :P&nbsp;
I dunno... maybe I'm reading too much between the lines here.)</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
I agree with Shadoe on this one.  It was nice to be able to dye your clothes to suit your tastes...  Even in "The Realm" (Blech), you could dye your clothes and armor.  I guess if you can't, then you can't, but it would be nice.
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> WIll there be an overall
skill cap, or will a player be able to master every skill available to
his class?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> There are skill caps
based on class -- so two classes might have the same skill, but one class
might have a higher cap.</I>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
I think the answer was that you can max out all of your skills to the highest level that your class will allow.  Unlike UO that has an arbitrary skillcap of 700 total points, in EQ, each class has maximum values that any skill can be.  If you practice enough, you can max them all...  Same sorta thing, but UO let you decide your own class, and EQ mandates your skills.  In UO, you could change professions, in EQ you can't.
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> If you are a low level adventurer
and group up w/ like a level 12 guy and watch him kill some monster, will
u still get exp cuz' you are in his group?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> We have implemented
a system that inhibits higher level players from 'twinking' exp for lower
lvl players.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> I noticed in the text on
some of the newer screenshots that it showed some monster casting an offensive
spell. if they can cast offensive then can they cast defensive spells on
themselves like heal?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Btrost> oh yeah</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;EQVBrd> I've heard that once you
die you get instantly resed in your home town, or something to that effect.
But If you get instantly resed, how will clerics res?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> It's different, but
we're not going to go into details at this point, sorry.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [Obsidian^ ) 1. Will there
be some way to report people, as there is no realistic way to have GM's
monitoring everything? And perhaps have a punishment for reporting false
alarms?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> We have something similar
in Tanarus, and are looking at appropriate ways to put it in EQ as well.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> Will we be able to kill
players and NPC's by falling on them?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> No.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(Then the little 60 lb. halfling won't have to
worry about being crushed and suffocating underneath the huge 450 lb. ogre
that just leaped on him from the outcropping twelve feet up? Does this
seem right to you? I dunno... I can see plusses and minusses both ways.)</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Interesting that you can take falling damage, but not damage things (people) that you fall on...  It would be an interesting initial strike if you were playing one of the larger Races.
</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay3> *Tharger* uhh...ok..."Is
the story by "Anonymous", in the latest EQX, which claims to be a story
about his experiences during the .5 beta test, true?"
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Yes, it was submitted
to me by one of the external beta testers, and I then forwarded it to EQX.</I>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Good...  That was the source of my comment on taking falling damage :)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [Gromph ) k... I dunno if
this has been answered before, but what exactly happens with say a Dark
Elf goes to a human town and tries to get in, what do the guards do?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Btrost> Depends on the Dark
Elf in question and what he has been up too.....</I>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Typically, the guards
will kill him, though.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> &lt;|Brandon> Will there
be some sort of jail for people who violate laws in towns/ cause in-game
problems?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Btrost> course... they are known
to kill them too...</I>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> No, they are typically
killed if caught too -- not a whole lot of civl rights in Norrath. Break
the law, die. That sort of thing. Now, if you are talking about non-game
related problems, those people are banned. cheaters, harassers, etc.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay3> *chib* when can you extimate
the next phase of beta will be out and do most the testers like the game?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> So far the vast majority
of testers love it... as for the next phase... we'll probably start a few
phase 2 people in the next week or so, but not all of them. I want another
100 or so people in sooner than I had originally planned. As for the rest,
probably in the next month or so.</I>

<P>&lt;Gaijin> [Daedalus ) If there are no inherent "worker" classes like
carpenter, will we have to buy arrows and other "makeable" products or
will there be a way to make them?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> You can buy items like
arrows, find them, quest for special ones.. beyond that I can't comment
at this time.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;RelayKyth> can Clerics turn undead?
In what fashion - e.g, destroyed, flee, or do they spin in a circle like
geeks? =)
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Actually, seriously,
there are ways to do all 3 of those -- destory them, make them flee, and
make them circle like geeks.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay_Ob> [Siraris ) Brad - I wanted
your professional oppinion... I wanted to get 2 Monster 3D 2 V2's and SLI
them to play EQ, but a friend of mine said that Matrox G200 is much faster
and has more updated Technology and will run EQ Much faster... is this
true or should I go with the SLI? You said before that you played EQ in
SLI and it was like a hot knife through butter
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> I'm really not in a
position to reccomend specific 3d cards for EQ -- both of the cards you've
mentioned are great. For performance, I'd reccomend you read the several
good articles out there on the net and in magazines that compare performance
of the various 3d cards.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [Vertinox ) will emoting
have sounds? like /laugh will actually make a sound or would that be too
much?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> We haven't finished
putting in all of the sounds in the game, so I can't comment on this yet.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(So there's hope yet for your farting emote,
Gram!)</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
WOO HOO!!!  We can only hope :)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> will there be any type of
transportation so as to move faster across land(not sea!) without use of
spells?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Can't comment on that,
sorry.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay_Ob> *SoloSteel* will people
like "Anonymous" be encouraged and/or allowed to tell beta stories like
he/she did? (after it goes through you of course)
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Beta testers are welcome
to send me their stories -- if they don't reveal information we haven't
released yet, then I have no problem forwarding them to be posted.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [ChrisLTD ) Will there be
race or kingdom wars in EQ? And would these circumstances allow PK'ing?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Guilds and other players
are welcome to involve themselves in wars and such -- and it's possible
our GMs will organize official conflicts given sufficient time.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> well, since certain races...don't
get along well enough to cohabitate, will there be any tolerant cities
so that friends who wnat to play a multi-racial party will be able to adventure
together, oir will this sort of thing be geographically discouraged to
the point of irrelevancy?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> There are plenty of
areas where multiracial parties could meet and adventure.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay_Ob> *HP-Koss* How will EQ
handle 'excessive' player killing? Will they resort to the same methods
3do and Origin use and ban entire guilds for simply becomming too good
and powerful?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> No, I don't see any
need to interfere with people playing the game legitimately, regardless
of how successful they are.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(Has Origin really done this in UO? It must have
been since I left, because I certainly don't remember seeing them do anything
like that. I mean, sheesh, it takes an Act of Congress just to get ONE
cheater banned in UO, much less an entire guild for merely becoming too
powerful. This whole thing just doesn't add up with me.)</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
I haven't heard about this one either...  Kinda impossible to BAN a guild though isn't it?
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> Compared to the size of
the char, what is the size of the world?
<BR>&lt;RedFalcon> (in scale miles, etc)
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> We haven't yet finished
the world... however I've been told by external testers that we're already
quite a bit bigger than our competition.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> Are the Guards vulnerable
and can you outrun them?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Guards in EQ are not
invulnerable.. as for whether you can outrun them, it depends on the guard
and it depends on you. Very situational.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [Erazimuss ) Will there
be, or what kind of restrictions will be placed on opposing alignments
in the same party. Can a Paladin and a Shadow Knight join the same party
with no penalties?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> At this point, we're
not restricting parties like that... we'll see how well that works in the
beta.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay_Ob> Ziv* Is the classes list
complete for races, or may more classes be available in the future? (Dwarven
Ranger wannabe)
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> The class and race
listing on the official site (www.everquest.com) is complete for what we
intend to have at ship. Class/Race combintations (which races can be which
classes) have not been released in that they are subject to change during
the beta.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> In a previous chat, or perhaps
a message board post, I remember something about "last names being earned".
Now, in recent screenshots, I have seen the main character named "Aramith
Mithara". Was this last name earned? And secondly, can you make a name
like "Hollakaranu of Freeport" (names with multiple words) without earning
them? Please clarifly this concept of last names or multiple words in names,
it will open up good ideas to potential role playing
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> last names and titles
are granted (ie. earned) -- when you create your character you create him/her
with just a first name. Aramith Mithara in the screenshots was a GM and
thus had a last name.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> Roman ) Can a PvP- get flagged
PvP+ if they mistakenly attack a PC thinking it is an NPC? IS there a dialogu
box that will pop up to warn you?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> There will either be
a dialog box warning you, or you just won't be able to harm another player
period if you're -pvp (the latter is the way it currently is in the game).</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(That makes me feel better. It would make me
feel even better still if he said that you can't heal a +pvp character
if you're -pvp. I'm hoping this is implicitly the case.)</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> concerning the skill 'meditate'.
its been said that it helps in memorizing spells quicker, and casting them
quicker. How long does it take to cast a spell? are they all different
times? and memorization..? how will this work?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Each spell can have
a different casting time. Meditate helps you regenerate mana more quickly
and helps you memorize spells more quickly -- it doesn't allow you to cast
a spell more quickly.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [DDH|Hate ) if your in a
player vs player fight and the other guy runs away, would it be possible
for him to run across an area that requires a long load time, and will
that enable a person with a faster machine to get away more easily?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> that has not been my
experience, no.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> is there an option once
u get and sign your NDA to d/l everquest instead of waiting 4 weeks for
the cd
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> We have let people
with fast connections d/l the client, yes.</I>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
SWEET!!!  I'm ready to go :)
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [Quas ) If you decide to
make PvP- become PvP+ if they for example heal PvP+.. why not make them
PvP- again after a certain time.. like some minutes.. so if they heal in
combat they can get attacked.. but if they do it in the wilderness they
just need to be a bit carefull
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> At this point, once
you are +pvp you can't return back to -pvp.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> Will Magic items and/or
weapons glow or eminate some sort of visible aura?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Can't comment on that
at this time, sorry.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(Hehehe... to me, that either speaks a definite
"yes" or a "oh my, we haven't thought of that... are you taking notes,
Btrost?")</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay3> [Aldgrim ) In the letter
that was submitted to EQX, the beta tester says "They provided me with
the equipment that someone of this level would probably be able to achieve
with hard work, a full set of leather armor" Is it really that difficult
to acquire items?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Yes, EQ is game in
which you can take real pride in character development. You have to earn
levels, earn skills, earn your items... and it can take some time. As I've
stated before, we're designing it such that it should take between 1 and
2 years to max out a character.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(1 and 2 years for the power gamer, or the casual
gamer, Brad?&nbsp; Maybe it will be 1 year for the power gamer, and about
2</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">years for the casual gamer.)</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
Ahhh...  The eternal question, How long is too long?  If you don't see character advancement, the game becomes boring.  If you are a god in 2 weeks, then you get bored...  The perfect balance is as of yet an elusive beast.
</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [RoadRebel ) who should
be contacted about dl'ing the client if our NDA was sent in already?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> No need to contact
anyone -- if you are chosen to d/l the client, we will let you know.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay3> [Daxx ) On the features
section of the EQ site (www.everquest.com) it says the following: Five
enormous continents to explore, as well as other dimensions and planes.
what is ment by dimensions and planes?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> As for dimensions and
planes... well, these are places outside the reality in which the world
of Norrath exists...</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(Well, DUH!)</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> do races still have their
own languages like mentioned a while back?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Yes.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> Endral ) Will chars just
rotate w/o animation, like Resident Evil for instance? Or were those animations
just not available at the time of the 3rd movie releaseat E3?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> The 3rd movie depicted
the beta at that time in development, and the game was not (and is not)
yet complete.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> Will the underground races(Dark
Elves, Dwarves, Gnomes, etc) have local caverns and below ground areas
to explore early on?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> There are plenty of
areas to explore near the various home towns.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay3> [Ziv ) I apologise if this
question has been answered before, but how would one go about learning
a different races language?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> We haven't yet revealed
all of the details related to different languages, sorry.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [DDH|Hate ) every good 3d
engine thus far has had to limit level size in order to make really cool
level, EQ has somehow gone beyond this?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Well, certainly levels
must be finite in size, but our engine has been designed for this game
(a massive RPG), and I think you'll find that our levels are very large.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> If Phase 2 is begining in
a week or so, have those 100 people been choosen?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> A portion of phase
2 people will be sent disks soon, but I'm not officially calling it phase
2 yet... the 100 people will probably be chosen randomly from the phase
2 list... and yes, the phase 2 list is complete.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay3> [TM-Grimst ) if items are
so hard to get, are they hard to lose? I mean working a month to get a
cool sword and losing it in minutes is gonna suck
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> It really depends on
the situation... how careful you are, what you're doing... whether your
-pvp or +pvp, etc.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> If the phase2 list is complete,
do those people know they are in yet?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> All phase 2 NDAs have
been mailed, as far as I know.</I>
<P><FONT COLOR="#9D0000">
DOH!!!  BAH!!!  I should have been more diplomatic with the Origin folks...  I'll never get in the beta :(
</FONT>
<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [Roman ) If you die during
the battle, do you still get eps? Will they be pro-rated somwhow?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> thats supposed to be exps
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Depends who died first,
you or the creature you were fighting. If you killed a monster, and then
died a few seconds later to another monster, you'd still get the exp for
the first monster.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> Will logging in a fight
be any sort of issue? Currently in certain 'other' games, closing the client
logs your character out of the game and thus out of the fight? How will
you be dealing with this?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Logging out, disconnecting,
etc. still leaves your character in the game, subject to death -- I wouldn't
reccomend doing that to try to escape a fight. let me clarify that... similar
to other games, you can camp out, which takes some time, which removes
your character from the game. however, just abruptly disconnection will
leave your character in the game for several minutes.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay3> [Gil ) will there be different
swordsmiths and such, and will you be able to find swords a fragile as
a piece of glass and as sturdy as a mountain (fancy wording) or will they
all be the same??
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> There are many different
kinds of swords... I'm not sure I understand that question totally. </I><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT>
&lt;Relay3> I think he means will sowrds of the same type have varying
strengths?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Swords and other items
don't wear out, if that's what you mean.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(Here's the question as I think it should be
asked. "If you acquire a long sword made by a blacksmith of exceptional
talent, will that long sword do more damage than any old average long sword?")</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [RymesP ) How long is the
loading between the zones? Is it seemless and can you see into the neighboring
zone?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> As for loading between
zones, it doesn't take too long, and we're still optimizing, so it will
only get better.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> [Pico-san ) How have you
decided who gets in these first few phases?Age and experience are my guesses.
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Both phase one and
phase two people have been chosen -- the exact method we used to select
these people is not public, but we've listed in the FAQ and elsewhere on
the site what's important to us. Phase 3 and beyond have not yet been chosen.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(With the number of people in their database,
it wouldn't surprise me if it came down to a toss-of-a-coin in many cases.)</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay3> [|oo| ) Yes I have a question
concerning race wars, say I am an ogre, will seeing a "Human" if I am not
on a raid or vice versa be a rare sighting? or will good/evil races be
mingled with each other?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> relay3: depends on
where you are -- players of all different races will be exploring the world
(I would hope) and could certainly run into each other.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> &lt;Pixiefox> Are/were the
phase 2 participants interviewed, or were NDAs simply mailed?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Phase 2 participants
were not interviewed verbally, no. That only occured for phase .5 and phase
one.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> I have a concern about being
able to switch from -PvP to +PvP during game. Now i know you can't switch
back from +PvP to -PvP or if you can it won't be easy. But my Concern is
those that use the PvP switch to hide behind until they attain a level
they deem acceptable and go +PvP. Now the thing I have a problem with is
(A.) It's Tactical Ability is Superior and i think unfair to those who
might start at an early age only to be Pked by. someone who does that,
only influences others to follow his method thus raising the standards
of PvP engagements.
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Some players will want
to get used to the game before switching to +pvp, while others want the
immediate challenge. It's up to the player.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(Not to mention the fact that the rules are the
same for ALL players. So what if they choose to go +pvp after a while?
You have the same option as they do! Of course, that means there are few
[if any] +pvp newbies to pick on.)</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay3> Bizzmark ) We need a new
(or a few new) EverQuest movies! When are you planning to release some
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Actually, we just finished
shooting raw footage for one last week and a new one is being made as we
speak.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(I hear it stars Eric Estrada.)</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay2> [Tharger ) If we just got
a whole new computer system, but we originally submitted a beta application
on the first day availible, would it be better to resubmit or leave it
at what it is?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> I would suggest you
resubmit with the updated information.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> SoloSteel ) what happens
if you get disconnected while swimming under water? do you sink and pray
to god, you can logon in time to save your charecter, or what?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Currently, you drown,
but we'll be experiementing in beta with ways to make this more fair (as
long as its not abusable). Perhaps you stop using air when you are link
dead. we shall see.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(Yeah, SOMEthing. I hardly think it would be
fair to simply drown. At least they're on the case.)</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay3> [ARH ) Are there "banks"
in everquest to hold your items in?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Can't comment on that
right now, sorry.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay3> [Daziarn ) if we resubmitted
our application due to things we forgot to mention the first time we submitted,
how drastically does that affect our chances of being entered into one
of the next phases?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> We look for multiple
apps submitted by the same person, and use the most recent in terms of
assuming whats the most up to date.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay3> [|oo| ) Concerning underwater
enviroment, will there be a such thing as secret caves that hold treasures,
or certain nooks and crannies with valuable items that would have to be
stumbled on by dumb luck or a long time searching?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Absolutely -- what
kind of RPG would we have without stuff like that.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-("No, sorry. The waters and swimming are merely
window dressing." Yeah right.)</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay3> oo| ) I am curious if one
can become "Famous" in the world of Norrath, or will one ever be able to
reach status of say "The High Council" where there names are known throughout
the land. Also, will PCs be able to achieve titles as say "Captain of the
Guard" or "Bishop" etc?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> There's definitely
an opportunity to become famous (or imfamous) in the game, but that's up
to you, the player.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [Calamus ) In 1st preson
perspective, will you be able to see your weapon, like in DaggerFall?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> Yes, but unlike other
games, it's not a bitmap we place there, but the actual weapon in the 3d
world. In fact, you can look down and see your toes.</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#1B651F">-(A real treat for players with toe fetishes and
pointy ears. Spread the good word, everybody!)</FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [Banchee ) will EQ run on
all processors or will it be made spacificly for Pentium....IE: AMD, Cyrix,
exc.?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> We're certainly not
doing anyting code wise that would make us not run on the various CPUs
out there..</I>

<P><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">Q:</FONT> &lt;Relay1> [Caesar_ ) I'm not sure
if this has been asked before, but if a human and an ogre meet in the game
somewhere and they are both -pvp can they attack each other since they
are enemies?
<BR><FONT COLOR="#0044FF">A:</FONT> <I>&lt;Aradune> no, if both are -pvp,
they cannot attack each other (unless they both consent to a duel).</I>

<P><I>&lt;Aradune> ok, that's it for me guys.</I>
<BR><I>&lt;Aradune> thanks for coming out -- I think this was our biggest
turn out yet.</I>
