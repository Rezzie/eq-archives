<P>Goblins are nasty scavengers. Everything they
        own or work with they either discovered or stole from
        somebody. Because of their lack of ingenuity, goblins are
        either found raiding towns, or in their lairs, which are
        typically primitive villages or damp natural caves. A
        solitary goblin is rarely a threat to even the most
        novice warrior, but their nature is to form clans and
        strike in groups. Wise adventurers, wary of that fact,
        avoid goblin settlements unless their numbers are also
        great.
