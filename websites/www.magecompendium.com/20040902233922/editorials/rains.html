<h3>Cliff Notes for Developers at SOE</H3>

<P>1. Allow Improved Damage focii to work with Rains.</P>

<P>2. Remove the 20% resist rate on rains (consequently decrease rain wave damage by 20% to compensate)</P>

<P>3. Adjust the damage/mana ratio of rains to more properly fall in line with their corresponding DDs.</P>

<H1>Introduction</h1>

<P>Traditionally, Rains have been a standard part of a Magician's repertoire of nukes, dealing very efficient damage and, in some cases, are superior to direct damage spells. However, that is behind us now. At present, Rains are on the way <I>out</I> as far as damage and efficiency are concerned, heading to the back of the spellbook.</P>

<P>I will present several screen captures from the <a href=http://www.magecompendium.com/library/mage-dd-chart.html>Magician DD Chart</a> (edited for clarity and ease of reading) to illustrate my points. All numbers are averages. The figure DPM refers to Damage Per Mana, the measure of a spell's efficiency. The higher the efficiency the better.</P>

<P>I'm avoiding the Evocation vs Conjuration debate, because frankly both schools of specialization face the same issue. Mana preservation is irrelevant too, since spells will all have the same relative change. The only focuses that will be examined are improved damage, and spell casting fury AAs.

<H1>Original Release and Kunark</H1>

<P>Before the Kunark expansion was released, spells were in their original form and were as closed to balanced as they got. However, Rains have an unusual penalty in that 20% of their waves will always resist. </P>

<P><img src=1.png></P>
<P><img src=2.png></P>

<P>What we see here is that rains are a highly efficient, highly damaging spells that far exceed the eficiency of equivalent level DDs at higher levels. At lower levels they fall between each major spell circle as a DD upgrade, but with less overall efficiency.</P>

<P>From the looks of things, rains are very balanced versus other spells, and even with the 20% resists they are still valuable spells. And indeed they are. Because of this, rains are highly valued for their high damage and high efficiency compared to DDs. The only major problem is the 20% resist rate; a single cast could hit for full, or a single cast could be completely resisted.</P>

<P>Furthermore, because they are Rains, they have two major risks. First, the damage is not done all at once; mobs could take damage from rains and move out of the whole rain. Two, because they are area effect, if there is a mezzed mob next to the intended target, they will wake the mezzed mob. Third, if multiple targets are hit, the total damage to any individual mob goes down.</P>

<P>The area effect nature of rains is acceptable, as is the ability to wake mezzed mobs. But future problems with rains aren't clear yet from Kunark. You have to  flash forward to Luclin.</P>

<h1>Luclin</H1>

<P><img src=3.png></P>

<P>Not much has changed with rains versus DDs. However a few things to note. First is Shock of Fiery Blades, a Direct Damage version of the Bolt Seeking Flame of Seukor with slightly less damage and slightly more mana (for overall less efficiency). Maelstrom of Electricity is the same mana as Manastorm, but much worse mana efficiency. Ancient Shock of Sun has a superior edge over other DDs in the damage and mana efficiency department, but doesn't match the overall maximum damage of rains.</P>

<P>Overall, not much has changed, other than giving an edge to a rare Ancient spell that 99% of mages will never see.</P>

<h1>Enter: Focus Items and Alternate Advancement</H1>

<P>For the first time in Everquest, focus items are introduced. Focus items work to improve spells, chiefly by increasing the damage dealt, decreasing the cast time, or decreasing the overall mana cost.</P>

<P>Also, Luclin introduced Alternate Advancement. Among these alternate advancement abilities is Spell Casting Fury, which provides a chance to do critical damage, and overall has an effect of increasing overall damage.</P>

<P>From this point on, I will only focus on the focuses and abilities that are causing the imbalance: Improved Damage, and Spell Casting Fury.</P>

<P>Vex Thal is unique for Luclin such that it has better focuses than are normally available to the average player: 26% improved damage being one of them. A typical Luclin-era mage would also have Spell Casting Fury.</P>

<P>To him, his DD table would look like this:</P>

<P><Img src=4.png></P>

<P>While all spells see an improvement in DPM, Direct Damage spells, by far, receive an even bigger boost than their Rain counterparts. Why is this? Improved Damage focii do not work on Rains. Therefore while Direct Damage spells receive a 20.5% (13.5% average from Improved Damage, 7% from crits), Rains only receive 7% improvement (7% from crits). It doesn't take a math major to realize, with enough improved damage, Luclin rains will become much less mana efficient than direct damage (excluding ancient).

<h1>Planes of Power</h1>

<P><img src=5.png></P>

<P>The main thing we see is that rains and Firebolt of Tallon are very close in damage, but Rains keep their mana efficiency. At least as a base.</P>

<P>But what if you had what many considered "ornate" gear from PoP, and maxed your crit AAs in PoP? 20% Improved damage (10.5% average), and 13% critical rate.</P>

<P><IMG src=7.png></P>

<P>I colored rains Red in the above image to allow them to stand out better.</P>

<P>The first thing you notice: Firebolt of Tallon has <I>exceeded</I> all rains. Worse, Firebolt of Tallon has also exceeded in mana efficiency Sun Storm, and is close to exceeding Maelstrom of Thunder. Black Steel and Sun Vortex are very close in DPM to Firebolt of Tallon, but both lag in average damage.</P>

<P>What you are beginning to see here is the marginalization of rains due to not scaling with caster gear the same way that direct damage spells do. The above image is for your <I>average</I> Magician in a non-raid guild.</P>

<P>Suppose he is in a raid guild and has the best focuses?</P>

<P><img src=8.png></P>

<P>For the first time, every direct damage spell exceeds the mana efficiency of rains bi quite a wide margin. Firebolt of Tallon is leaps and bound more damage tahn the best rain Maelstrom of Ro. Why is this? Again, Rains are not affected by improved damage focii; a Time-equipped mage has a 35% improved damage focus (18% average) and 13% crit rate. Direct Damage spells receive a full 31% improvement, while rains only receive a 13% improvement.

<h1>Gates of Discord</H1>

<P>The problem only grows worse for a high end Magician: 45% improved Damage (23% average) and 16% critical rate nets the following chart:</P>

<P><img src=9.png></P>

<P>Rock of Taelosia falls smack dab inbetween Sun Storm and Maelstrom of Thunder in terms of average damage while keeping a huge mana efficiency lead. Ancient Chaos Vortex, while rare, does something Ancient Shock of Sun did not: it exceeds rains in damage.</P>

<P>Looking at these numbers, theres almost no reason for players to use rains. With an abnormally high resist rate, no scaling with improved damage, and the substantially lower DPM than direct damage spells, rains are now completely obsolete.</P>

<h1>How To Fix Rains</h1>

<P>The one thing that makes rains not worth the scroll they're written on is that they do not scale as the magician improves in gear, whereas direct damage spells do. So the first thing that needs to be done is to allow improved damage spells to work with Rains. This alone will allow rains to scale with improvements in gear.</P>

<P>Second is to remove the 20% resist check on rains. Direct damage spells are already hindered by increasingly higher resists as mob difficulty rises. Rains are further penalized by this, in addition to their Area Effect nature.</P>

<P>To compensate for this, rains should receive an approximate 20% reduction in overall damage. Some rains should have their mana efficiency looked at to ensure they fall better as an inbetween spell between spell circles.</P>

<P>Here is the proposal.</P>

<P>Allowing improved damage to work on rains will net the following chart.</P>

<p><img src=10.png></P>

<P>If these changes go in, Rains will be once again balanced with the ever increasing amount of focus items and the penalizing 20% resist check will no longer be an issue.</P>
