Client Patch<br>
<br>
Tonight we patched out a new EverQuest client.  This client will address issues reported by those using video cards that require square textures, and who are crashing or experiencing garbled textures.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We are working on the other problems reported.  As always, please be sure you have installed DirectX 7 or higher, and have also installed the latest drivers for your video card.  It is very important that the video drivers are installed AFTER DirectX.<br>

IMPORTANT NEW MESSAGE<br>
<br>
Combine Button Containers<br>
<br>
First of all thank you to everyone who posted the problem with the Velious
Tailoring recipes and other recipes that appeared to be broken after the patch.<br>
<br>
With the most recent patch, we fixed a bug that is causing some confusion with
these recipes.<br>
<br>
There was a bug that allowed certain recipes to work in any container of its
type, where they were intended to work only in special containers of that type.
For example, there are recipes that were intended to only work in the Coldain
Tanner's Kit that could be completed in any Sewing Kit. That bug was repaired
along with some other minor bugs associated with combine button containers in
this last patch.<br>
<br>
Please make sure that you are using the proper container as instructed by in
game instructions or npc's when combining trade skill components or quest
components in any combine button container.<br>
<br>
The Velious Tailoring Recipes are currently functioning in the Coldain Tanners
Kit. We apologize for the inconvenience.<br>
<br>

:&nbsp; Server Side Filtering</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">March 27th, 6:00 pm<br>
<br>
Server-Side Filter Clarification<br>
<br>
If you use the Chat Filter options in game to turn off OOC, Shout, Auction, Guild Chat, Damage Shields or any form of combat miss, this filtering will occur on the server automatically.  This means that once you turn them off, these messages will not even be sent to your computer.<br>
<br>
All other messages will remain filtered on the Client Side (by your computer rather than the server) even if you turn them off, until you type
/serverfilter ON.  When you do that then they will be filtered at the server.  This may, however, prevent you from seeing certain spell particle effects and possibly some damage animations.
/serverfilter OFF will allow these messages to be sent to your computer once again.<br>
<br>
The advantage to filtering things on the server rather than at your computer is that it reduces the amount of data that needs to be sent to your computer.  For people that don't have the best connections to the Internet, and/or for those in locations where a lot of data is being sent (such as in raid situations), server-side filtering should make the game more stable.<br>

message boards.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello all,</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Upon EverQuest’s release, Sony
Online Entertainment, then a separate company, came to Verant Interactive and
proposed that they set up and host community message boards on the EverQuest
site. The purpose of these boards was to provide a place for EverQuest players
to hang out, get to know each other, and basically do what EverQuest players do
in any of dozens of message forums hosted by EverQuest fan sites.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As they grew more popular, a
culture of dedicated and knowledgeable players formed, and the forums quickly
evolved into a place where game design concepts were discussed freely by a
relatively small group of people. As a developer always open to new ideas, the
boards did not go unnoticed by the EverQuest design team, and we began
commenting on issues there regularly.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As the weeks went on, some
EverQuest players heard that the “Official” EverQuest forums were the place
to go if you wanted to speak with the EverQuest Development Team. As issues were
addressed, it was apparent that the boards were a phenomenal tool for collecting
player feedback, listening to issues, and occasionally to release information.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In late 1999, we decided to even
further our commitment to communicate with players about development issues –
a philosophy that remains true to this day. And it seemed the boards were the
best place to do this. To that end, a full-time Community Relations Manager was
hired to not only disseminate information to the public via the boards, but also
to bring the public’s issues to the development team such that valid player
issues would be addressed and not overlooked – the latter part being key.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fast-forward to today:
Unfortunately, the EverQuest message boards are often a hotbed of exaggerated
negativity where only through one-upmanship, melodramatics, and dauntless
persistence can one hope to create a big enough thread surrounding an issue as
to have it addressed. Posters with the opportunity and time to engage in these
tactics at least get to see an Official tell them “Yes” or “No”, while
others with equally valid stated concerns and the same desire to make the game
better for everyone see their posts fall off within minutes, only to be
overlooked or missed in the end. That, or they simply don’t post at all,
avoiding the boards and the negativity found therein (we’ve received a lot of
player feedback via email and at Fan Faires attesting to this phenomenon).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, this is simply not
acceptable. Our original goal for the boards was to have them serve as a place
where valid player issues would be addressed and not overlooked. We need and
want to hear the feedback of anyone willing to send it. You deserve to know that
your feedback is being read, that your issues are being considered by the design
team, and that the chance of having your thoughts heard is not tied to your
ability to be outspoken and persistent in a public forum. That is one thing all
of our goals have in common, and one thing that we need to improve such that we
are able to give players the input and feedback they deserve – the current
“public” process.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To that end, we’re making a
number of changes, both to the message boards and the procedures for sending
feedback. First, you’ll notice that the Harpy’s Head and the Official
Message Boards have been shut down. This is a temporary measure to allow people
to time to read up on the new processes and rules in place prior to posting on
official EverQuest forums. Some boards will be reopened in one-to-two weeks time
under the new rules.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Harpy’s Head boards will
reopen under their existing rules (in-character), but will require an active
EverQuest account to post. The Wishlist, the Newbie Zone, and the Customer
Service/Technical Help forums will also reopen at the same time, but will have
very strict guidelines concerning the type of content that is allowed in those
forums. Other former forums, including the server and class forums, will not
reopen.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Two new forums, “Developer’s
Corner” and “Quality Assurance”, have been added. These forums will take
the place of the former “General Discussion” and “Testing” forums. The
difference here is that attempting to post a message or reply will take you to a
special form where you can “Submit Comments” to the Development and Quality
Assurance teams. Representatives from each team will read all of the comments
submitted and choose several daily to which to reply publicly. Those
representatives will then quote your comments if chosen in individual posts
under the appropriate read-only forum. These forums will also be used for
special announcements, inquiries, and the release of important information as it
is appropriate. And we also hope it will be much easier for players to keep
track of what is going on in EverQuest.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is very important to us that we
are able to address the needs of our customers. It’s not only important from
the perspective of our goal of providing good service, but also for our primary
goal: To be the number one online gaming company in the industry. Player
feedback is so important to this process that we are taking these steps in order
to gather feedback from more people more effectively. We are committed to
responding not only to more issues, but also to more issues of concern and
interest to a broader range of players. Finally, we are committed to giving our
playerbase more input into what we do, and more insight into how and why we are
doing it.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These changes are a sincere
attempt to make all of that more possible. Please join us in ushering in a new
age of communication and collaboration and visit the EverQuest Message Boards to
submit your comments today.</font>

Once all the spaces are taken, we will not be accepting any further registrations (or walk-ins).  So if you plan to attend sign up before someone else gets your spot.  Head over to www.everquest.com to register.<br>
<br>
Patch Day&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Spell Changes and Additions<br>
<br>
- A new teleportation spell has been added to the game for both Druids and Wizards.  These are self-only gate spells to the Dreadlands.  These spells should be available on the more exclusive spell vendors in Norrath.<br>
<br>
- Increased the drop rate on some Kunark spells to coincide with the narrowing of the creatures carrying those spells as the game evolves.<br>
<br>
- Wizards now have access to a new type of spell that only works on certain types of target.  Generically called 'bane' spells, a few are now available in the game.  May your quest for such spells be successful.<br>
<br>
Item Changes<br>
<br>
- Changed the effects on the Singing Steel Boots and Greaves.  After a fair amount of concern from players, we have removed the summon food and water effects from these items.  They have been replaced with modified versions of Aria of the Eagles (boots) and Appalling Screech (greaves).<br>
<br>
- The Incandescent Bracer can now be worn on the wrist rather than the waist.<br>
<br>
- The Incarnadine Breastplate must now be worn to activate.<br>
<br>
- Changed spell effects on Pauldrons of the Fearsome and Fearsome Shield to right click and worn to activate.<br>
<br>
Bug Fixes<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that was causing some players to zone into the Warrens at the wrong location.<br>
<br>
- Corrected an error with the Bixie Sword Blade, changing its delay from 6 to 16.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug where Iskar Monks were unable to Feign Death after Foraging.<br>
<br>
- Kodiaks in the Great Divide are now seen as animals.<br>
<br>
- Toxdil, the wandering rogue poison vendor, will now sell to characters even when he is away from his home.<br>
<br>
Enhancements<br>
<br>
- Fixed a problem that occurred when players mistyped /guild.  Typing /guildd in the chat window is the shortcut for typing /guilddelete.  /guildd now has a confirmation box so that such an error should no longer lead to the accidental deletion of a guild.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
- Added /showspelleffects.  Using this toggle ('on' or 'off') a player can turn on or off the display of particle effects for spells.  This will only affect spells, not world effects like waterfalls or weapon particle effects.  This should allow you to turn off many of the effects that hamper rendering performance, inducing effects of spells, while still being able to see some of the awesome effects, like those on certain paladin weapons...<br>
<br>
- Added server-side filtering for chat and combat messages.  This will allow you to turn off guild chat, shouts, auctions, oocs, 'my misses', 'others misses', 'others hits', 'attacker misses me', PC spells (all options), NPC spells and Bard songs (all options) at the server instead of at the client.  This can reduce that amount of data sent to you over your connection, and can help those with slower connections with better performance and connectivity.<br>
<br>
- Ships will now be announcing their arrival in most zones.  They will also be announcing their progress to any zone they travel through.  Any of those zones that they are not currently making announcements in will be added in the next patch or two.<br>
<br>
- Shift - Left and Shift - Right will now repeat in the chat window.  This means that when editing what you've typed, you can just hold down the Shift and Left Arrow keys and the cursor will move left until it reaches the beginning of the line or until you release the keys.<br>
<br>
- The spell slot number will now show up in front of the spell name when you press Alt to cast a spell using the Alt-Spell Number method.<br>
<br>
- View perspective in wolf form has been fixed.  First-person view will now be on level with the wolf, rather than a few feet above it.  At the same time, perceiving other players in wolf form will appear to be standing on the ground instead of floating a few feet above it.<br>
<br>
- Trade skill success and failure messages will be sent to the craftsperson's group instead of just the craftsperson, as long as the craftsperson is using the proper ingredients.  Failure of the craftsman to use the proper ingredients will result in no failure message being sent.<br>
<br>
- In order to prevent a few trade scams, money can no longer be removed from a trade window.  You will have to cancel the trade and start over to adjust the amount of money involved in the trade.<br>
<br>
- We're now sending hitpoint updates to the casters of direct damage spells no matter how far away they are when the spell lands.  This will allow those casters that try to stand as far back as possible to get updates even when their range indicates that the messages should be
surpressed.<br>
<br>
Quest<br>
<br>
Several new quests have been added as well, so don't be afraid to talk to the folks of Norrath, they might have new information for you.<br>
<br>
