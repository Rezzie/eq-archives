:</b></font> To find the words
you are seeking for or components there are several options available.</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
<br>
1. Ask higher level mages if they have extra words or components that they can hand out which are trivial for that mage.</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
<br>
2. Find a mage and be friends with him/her, though don't give the higher level mage a headache with trivial questions. Ask them what they prefer how to
research, tips , tricks etc. But not like , can you get me this spell, or can you get me this item. That bugs them.</font>
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
<br>
3. Save every penny you have and look every vendors every day several times. Found quit a few
interesting components and words. (for my friend i ended up with over 20 Transcendence within 2 weeks).</font>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">4. Just go to
different zones and auction what you are looking for, don't say &quot;WTB&quot; that makes the seller jack the price. just say &quot;Looking for
...&quot; and they tell you what they have . Almost all components till level 34 and 39 was
within 2-3 plat each range. Anyone who charges you more, ignore them. Trust
me, sometimes they come back to you and sell at normal price again.</font>
</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">4b. By going around
different zones, sometimes ppl are just running out of rooms in their inventory and they gladly give away words , sometimes they
give you even necro or/and pages, those you sell for money or give them to your friends that can use them, and perhaps your friends help find stuff
for you ; ). Got about half of my research free like this but not enough to gain
skills just alone with mage search stuff, pumped about over 100 practice skill at the end at my trainer.</font>

Making money with research: If you research , sometimes you end up with extra spells, try to research stuff that cannot be bought such as pets and
Everfount. Several other mages who are just lazy are willing to give big amount of money for it.</font>

Yes, research and extra spells takes alot of bank space, tip: make a mule and transfer the research stuff back and forth with only the person you
trust and not some strangers ; )</font>
