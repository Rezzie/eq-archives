<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of the Rakthokian Kingdom and General
Dagnor</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For centuries while the elven empire grew to
the east, the dwarves and ogres had thrived in the mountains to the west,
surrounding the forest presently known as &quot;Lesser Faydark.&quot; The
dwarves settled into the jagged cliffs of what is known as the butcherblok
mountains and there had established their golden kingdom of Kaladim, &quot;The
forge of Norrath.&quot; The ogres were able to wrestle control of nearby lands
from the orcan hordes of Faedwer after a decade of warfare and established the
first ogreian kingdom in the nearby Rakthokian ridge mountain range, named after
the first ogre leader &quot;Rakthok the Warlord.&quot; There in the Faydark west
the dwarves and ogres lived in an uneasy peace.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While the immense empire of the elves could
have easily crushed either one of the kingdoms, the ogres saw the dwarves as a
primary concern. Raised in a culture where only the strength in your arms and
the size of your weapon mattered, the ogres of the kingdom of Rakthok considered
only the dwarves to be their equal and thus a very large threat. The ogres were
also greedy of the gold-rich mountain mines and the stone cutting skill of the
Kaladim kingdom, and to make matters worse, the friendly disposition of the
dwarves did not agree with the savage and chaotic tendencies of the Rakthokian
ogres. What resulted was an intense racial hatred and many small fights between
the two kingdoms.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the beginning of the second age, when the
elven rebels against the god Innoruk began to surface, Dagnor the Butcher was
chosen as the 5th warlord of the Rakthokian Kingdom. Clearly the most ambitious
of all the previous Rakthokian kings, Dagnor was the first to realize that the
small skurmishes between dwarves and ogres would never solve anything and that
for the ogres to gain anything substantial, the dwarves would have to be
completely overcome or slaughtered. He saw the mines of Kaladim as an infinite
source of limitless wealth and power. Almost immediately after he seized the
throne Dagnor began to assemble the largest combined army of ogres since the
orcan clans had been overthrown. Dagnor was held in check for a long time,
however, because Kaladim was a chief source of gold and weapons for the elven
empire and the dwarves would find the elves a strong ally if war broke out. The
ogre king was smart enough to realize that his kingdom could not survive an
attack from both sides and so he did not advance and the dwarves did not regard
him as much of a threat. While the indomitable elven empire loomed over western
Faedwer, war was not an option for either the dwarves or the ogres.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Of the attacks on Northern
Kaladim</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dagnor is sometimes referred to as the
destroyer of two empires. When he began his campaign against the dwarven kingdom
of Kaladim he began the fall of his own kingdom of Rakthok, but also he stopped
the dwarves from giving aid to the elven empire against the ever increasing
elven rebel armies. Many historians surmise that if the dwarves had not been
pulled into war with the ogres, their help would have caused the downfall of the
rebel army and the old elven empire would still be in existence.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In any case, with the war of the broken crown
raging to the east, Dagnor knew the elves could not afford to lend aid to the
dwarves and he took the opportunity to launch his own campaign against the
kingdom of Kaladim. The warlord knew that the key to beating the dwarves was
through the less guarded lands of northern area Kaladim where the dwarves had
primarily established trading centers and peaceful mining villages. So in the
middle of the second age, the 5th warlord of the Rakthokian kingdom marched his
army of ogres and orcan slaves west across the hills of shade directly to
northern Kaladim without fear of elven intervention.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Old dwarves still tell the horrible tales of
the first ogre attacks. Ill prepared to meet such an invasion force, the
peaceful cities of northern Kaladim were swept over with tremendous speed. Ogre
warriors burned everything they could put a torch to and killed every dwarf they
saw be it man, woman, or child. In little less then a week the forces of Dagnor
had surprised Kaladim and caused the deaths of hundreds of dwarves. The warlord
had found the weakness in the impenetrable kingdom of Kaladim and now marched
directly for the capital.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Of king Grimmly Fireforge and
the battle on the Hills of Shade</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was Dagnor's unnecessary need to stop and
make sure everything was dead in the wake of his army that gave the time the
dwarves needed to prepare. Word reached the capital city of Kaladim days before
the ogres arrived. Hearing the startling news of the advancing army, the 12th
dwarven king Grimmly Fireforge, an excellent fighter and brilliant military
tactician, began to assemble a defensive force. Dagnor also did not anticipate
the speed by which the dwarves could gather into a force large enough to repel
his own. It was the warlord's first mistake.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When the army of ogres reached the Crakthorn
ridge, just one mile from the capital city of Kaladim, they were met by an
equally large force of dwarves lead by king Grimmly. The fighting on the ridge
was savage and brutal, but being less skilled at fighting in tight tunnels and
with low light then the dwarves, the ogres were forced to flee. Dagnor ordered
his army into the hills of shade where the dwarves and ogres could fight on
equal ground.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Day and night the battle raged across the hills
of shade above the lesser faydark and the grass was bleached red with the blood
of the fallen. Both armies were fueled by soldiers from their respective
kingdoms and soon the war had ground into a stalemate.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Of the Orcan betrayal and the
battle of the Shattered Spear</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thinking that the war would either be won or
lost on the hills of shade, Dagnor ordered his southern most forces guarding the
forest of lesser Faydark to move north and add more strength to the army in the
hills. He left instead a handful of ogre soldiers and mostly a host of orcan
slaves. It was Dagnor's second and most fatal mistake.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For the first time in history dwarves and orcs
came to an agreement and entered in on an alliance. The dwarves promised the
orcan slaves of the defeated orcan clans their freedom if they would not
interfere in the war in favor of both sides. Completely in favor with the plan,
which gave the orcs freedom but did not require them to fight, the orcan slaves
retreated from lesser faydark to the east, deserting the armies of Dagnor and
leaving the southern hills wide open. King Grimmly took this opportunity to
assemble a second force to the south and then attacked Dagnor's army from both
the front and the undefended flank. The ogre forces on the hills of shade were
demolished. Dagnor fled with few others and the Rakthokian kingdom was now
completely vulnerable. Grimmly gathered his remaining forces and headed straight
for the ogre capital, leveling any fortresses he came to and burning Rakthok to
the ground. The Rakthokian army had been broken.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The last official battle took place beneath the
forest of lesser Faydark as the remaining ogre forces, lead by Dagnor, attempted
to flee to the south. They were met there by a small force of vengeful dwarven
soldiers who were able to hold them off until the arrival of the main dwarven
host. When King Grimmly and his army arrived, the forces of Dagnor fought
viciously and were able to kill many, but were ultimately defeated. A story
tells that Grimmly and Dagnor met eachother face to face on the shores of a lake
to the south of lesser faydark during one of these fights, and that Grimmly
stabbed Dagnor with a spear with such intensity and ferociousness that the
weapon shattered into thousands of pieces even as it cut straight through the
ogre lord's chest. The story goes on to say that the warlord fell to his death
immediately in that same lake and that the evil in his blood made the water boil
and turn red. Thus the dwarves mockingly renamed the lake Dagnor's Cauldron and
thus the final battle of the ogre-dwarven war was called &quot;the battle of the
shattered spear.&quot;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Of the Trail of Blood and the
new kingdom of Oggok</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Barely more then three hundred ogres had
survived from a host of thousands and, saying their prays of forgiveness to
their god Rallos Zek for loosing the war, the survivors hastily retreated to the
south-west. For two weeks the ogres fled and the forces of king Grimmly hounded
them at every step, killing all those they could catch up with. The ogres
plundered every small city they came to, even the shattered ruins of the elven
capital of Caerthiel where they found ships and supplies they could use. Finally
fleeing all the way across the Loping Plains, they set sail across the eastern
oceans and away from the closing dwarves. The first Ogre-Dwarven war had
officially ended.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The ogres : beaten, wounded, and without a
leader, reached the then barren continent of Antonica a month after setting sail
from Faedwer. Day and night the forces of a once great Rakthokian Kingdom
marched tirelessly through the endless desert of Ro and soon to the empty
mountain range of what is now known as the serpent's spine. Wanting some time to
rebuild and recuperate, the ogres found the mountain's natural geography a good
advantage over any invasion force. Here they started the foundations of a new
ogre capital, guarded on all sides by two rivers, a desert, a lake, jagged
mountains, and a thick jungle, where they could start to assemble again and
build a new army for the second ogre-dwarven war. They called their new kingdom
&quot;Oggok&quot; which in ogreish means &quot;Revenge.&quot;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The second age ended in war and death with the
promise of a new beginning. The petty squabbling of the elder races on the
continent of Faydwer had ended tragically and none of the kingdoms would ever
fully recover. The seeds for revenge had been sewn and the entire world had
changed for all the elder races. With the immigration of the dark elves to
Neriak on Antonica and of the ogres to Oggok, new lands had been discovered and
none of the elder races had the power anymore to stop the kingdoms of the gnomes
and halflings of expanding nor did they have the strength to control the ever
increasing population of the humans. The second age was a time of death,
sadness, and change for Norrath.</font></p>
