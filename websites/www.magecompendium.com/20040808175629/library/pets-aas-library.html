<P><B>Pet Discipline</B><BR>
Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<BR>
6<BR>
Allows a magician to execute a /pet hold command, forcing the pet to stop attacking until told to attack.<BR>
By far one of the magicians most powerful abilities, this removes most liability with using a pet by allowing the mage to control when to attack. Highly useful for the raid mage, but still useful for both the solo and the group mage.</P>

<P><B>Quick Summoning</B><BR>
Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<BR>
3 / 6 / 9<BR>
Decreases cast time on pet summons by 10%, 25%, and 50%.<BR>
Highly useful for chaining pets. Worth noting that spell haste is capped at 50%, which Quick Summoning 3 reaches.</P>

<P><B>Mend Companion</B><BR>
Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<BR>
5<BR>
Reuse Time: 36 minutes<BR>
Allows Magicians to perform a Lay-On-Hands type ability for their pets.<BR>
At level 65, this ability does 2146 hp worth of healing. Highly useful for soloing. Reuse time can be further decreased by the PoP ability Hasted Mend.</P>

<P><B>Hasted Mending</B><BR>
Level 63 / 64 / 65 - Mend Companion<BR>
2 / 2 / 2<BR>
Decreases the reuse time on Mend Companion by 25% (not 10%) per level.<BR>
Highly useful for the solo magician, as it allows his Mend to be used much more regularly, saving significant mana over time.</P>

<P><B>Suspended Minion</B><BR>
Level 62 / 64<BR>
5 / 3<BR>
Cast Time: 4 seconds<BR>
Reuse Time: 1 second<BR>
Allows a magician to suspend their pet. With level 1 only HP is saved, but with level 2 both gear and buffs are saved.
Highly useful in any circumstance. Allows for a magician to have fully equipped backup pets, or to pocket his pet so he may cast invisibility and move to a different location.</P>

<P><B>Pet Affinity</B><BR>
Level 65<BR>
20<BR>
Allows your pet to be a valid target for group spells.<BR>
This allows your pet to be hit by all forms of group spells, including buffs, heals, damage shields and songs. Very useful for the high end Magician, marginally useful for group magicians, and somewhat useful for solo magicians.</P>

<P><B>Elemental Fury</B><BR>
Level 65<BR>
3 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 3<BR>
Imbues Magician elementals with the chance to perform criticals hits thru melee. Each rank adds an approximate 1% chance to critical hit. Each critical is an additional 63% over the original base damage.</P>

<P><B>Elemental Alacrity</B><BR>
Level 65<BR>
3 / 6 / 9 / 12 / 15<BR>
Imbues Magician elementals with the chance to perform flurry attacks. Each rank adds an approx 1.5% chance to flurry. A flurry is an additional two swings on the primary hand.</P>

<P><B>Elemental Agility</B><BR>
Level 65<BR>
4 / 8 / 12<BR>
Increases Magician pet avoidance and midigation by an approximate 2%, 5%, and 10%.</P>

<P><B>Elemental Durability</B><BR>
Level 65<BR>
4 / 8 / 12<BR>
Increases Magician pet HP by 2%, 5%, and 10% above the base.</P>
