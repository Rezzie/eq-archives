<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of the gnomes and the empire of
Felwithe</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ever the since the first days of the elven
rebellion, it had been decided by the emperor of Felwithe that the gnomes would
be a free race allied with the elven empire and able to live on elven lands,
much unlike the almost slave-like persecution the little tinkers suffered under
the rule of the dark elves. The gnomes had been granted lands surrounding the
fertile Elizerain Lake and there existed for a century or more in peace with
their elven neighbors. However, being on elven lands also meant the gnomes would
have to follow elvish customs, and increasingly the gnomes began to feel out of
place. The gnomes were builders, not artists, and they could not sing or dance
or play musical instruments. Elves prided themselves on their use of the bow and
their long, graceful blades but gnomish arms couldn't support the lengthy elven
weaponry. And while the elven language was meant to be spoken in long,
descriptive, and fluid verse, the gnomes were always prone to speak in jittery
and incredibly fast sentences. Slowly, a general concensus began to form among
the gnomes that someday a separate gnomish kingdom would have to be formed. The
gnome most responsible to bring about this change was named Biddyn.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Biddyn was born the fourth son to a poor farmer
on the east of the Elizerain Lake, the gnomish territories closest to the heart
of the empire. Almost immediately he recognized how much he, and even his
brothers and father, hated farm work. The most joyous times in his life, as he
later wrote, were the monthly festivals the gnomes held where they would gather
and build all manner of fascinating machines. This, he thought, is what gnomes
should be doing and he bestowed upon himself the responsibility to make sure
this came to pass. Studying elven mannerisms and rhetoric on his market voyages
to Felwithe with his father, Biddyn soon became a speaker the likes of which no
gnome has ever equaled. His very charisma charmed everyone around him into the
idea of a separate gnomish kingdom, and he soon was ready to bring his demands
before the emperor.&nbsp; The emperor at this time was none other then Carandril,
past lord of Kelethin, who had appointed the warrior Edril as his first soldier
long ago and also as the head of the imperial army. Edril had served loyally and
skillfully as Carandril's guard for more then a hundred years, the warrior elf
being only a little more then middle-aged for his race.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Charmed by his determination and skillful
speaking, Edril supported Biddyn for a separate gnomish kingdom. Even the
emperor was attracted to the proposition, as a new allied kingdom would open new
opportunities for trade while the gnomish loss would not be a big drain on the
imperial economy. After only six days of deliberation, Carandril granted
Biddyn's request and plans were immediately formed for the creation of a new
gnomish homeland. The emperor severed the southern part of his empire, mostly
unused and barren fields beyond the steamfont mountains, and gave it to the
gnomes. The land was renamed &quot;Akanon&quot; which is elven for
&quot;Gift&quot; and ten gnomish settlers as well as five elven guards were
prepared to make a journey into Akanon and chart the lands.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of the Plague Dragon and the
formation of Ak'anon</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The fifteen settlers rode out surrounded by the
cheers of elves and gnomes alike, but were not heard from for many months.
Finally after the fifth month of their disappearance, only one elven soldier,
his clothes torn to pieces and his weapons shattered, rode solemnly through the
gates of the empire. He was the last of the settlers who remained alive, and
recounted his tale before an astonished imperial council. A plague dragon, with
scales of an oozing black, had attacked the party soon after they had crossed
into the southern lands and had claimed that the lands of Akanon were his own.
For months the plague dragon chased them and hunted the gnomes and elves down.
The soldier had watched each man die a slow and horrible death, and believed the
dragon only let him go to give this message to the elves.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The gnomes were instantly furious that
Carandril had given them cursed lands to settle, and the emperor immediately
ordered the death of the dragon. Frightened by the terrible story of the
soldier, most of his warriors were reluctant to volunteer, as Carandril would
not force anyone to fight such a terrible beast. Edril, however, immediately
offered his services as a personal favor to the gnomes. When Biddyn himself
volunteered five more gnomes joined the hunt, and together with his gnomish
friends, Edril rode to the steamfont mountains to meet the terrible beast. What
happened next is best summed up by Biddyn's own &quot;The History of the
Gnomes&quot;:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I admit as much, that even my legs were shaking
when we approached the mouth of the demon's great cave. From our previous
encounters, and from the memories of our lost friend Dolyn, we were all
terrified of the beast. All of us, that is, except for Edril, but I don't think
Innoruk himself could scare that elf. He thrives from fear as much as I do the
tobacco in my pipe, it is to him as some sweet nectar that clears his thoughts
and hones his blade. So while we trembled before the plague dragon's domain,
Edril simply lifted his sword to his shoulder, looked back at me, and said
&quot;wait here.&quot; With a proud determination he marched toward the black
cave entrance, a portal to the lower planes if ever there was one. He marched to
his death, or so we thought. But when we saw him next in two days time he pulled
behind him the head of the evil beast, which left thick trails of a green poison
behind it. He breathed heavily, and painful scars covered his body. I laughed,
thinking that while Edril was obviously hurt, the dragon must have felt much
worse before his death. Anything that inflicts that much pain to the elf must be
prepared to receive the same thrashing tenfold.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The skull of the dragon sits still on the
entrance to the gnome's own Fortress Mechanus. Edril and his band of gnomes
would be written into gnomish lore forever as for the next weeks they rode
tirelessly through the lands of Akanon, fighting back fierce creatures and
charting the perfect hillside location for the first ever kingdom of gnomes.
Edril spent much more time in Akanon then originially expected, personally
overseeing the kingdom's construction. When the first houses were made and the
first gnomish settlers came pouring in, Biddyn was selected as the first king of
the gnomes and he in turn erected a statue in honor of Edril. The statue depicts
Edril's battle with the great plague dragon, and gnomish craftsmanship made it
enormous and actually useful: it sits in the heart of Akanon even today, acting
as the central part to Akanon's extensive irrigation system. When Edril returned
home to Felwithe he was greeted by hundreds of proud soldiers and again
proclaimed a hero.</font></p>
