Updated Patch Message<br>
<br>
Some additional changes were included in today's patch that were not listed in
the patch message earlier today. This patch message is a replacement for the one
posted earlier :<br>
<br>
Miscellaneous Changes<br>
<br>
- /trackplayers now supports a &quot;GROUP&quot; option, allowing trackers to
exclude all player characters, except ones in their current group.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The EQCLIENT.INI has some new features, including one allowing logging (/log)
to be on by default. Updated documentation for the EQCLIENT.INI file is at the
end of this patch message.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Activatable items, such as Journeyman's Boots, can now be activated by the
corresponding number-key if placed in a hotbox.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Items that are &quot;out of charges&quot; now display &quot;Charges:
None&quot; when inspecting the item.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Attack-speed buffs and debuffs will now stack correctly. In other words, lower
level spells will no longer overwrite higher level spells of the same type.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The &quot;U&quot; key (short for &quot;use&quot;) has had its functionality
enhanced. It now does the equivalent of a single left-click and single
right-click at the center of the screen. In addition to opening doors, it will
now consider and inspect PCs, consider NPCs, and use bankers, merchants, and
guildmasters.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Fixed the way that spell-effect icons are displayed on the UI. Previously,
after adding several &quot;buffs&quot; to a character, one of the icons would be
placed down in the chat window.<br>
<br>
Chat/Login Server<br>
<br>
This patch contains eqmain.dll, which is used by the EverQuest login/chat
frontend. The following changes have been implemented:<br>
<br>
- #help now accepts arguments. #help #command will return help for the requested
command.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Errors issued within the chat/login server frontend now display an &quot;Error
Number&quot;. Please have this error number ready when requesting technical
assistance.<br>
<br>
Looking for Group Flag<br>
<br>
Players can now indicate that they are &quot;looking for a group&quot; by typing
/LFG. This command will flag your character in both zone-specific /who lists,
and the server-wide &quot;/who all&quot; list with &quot;LFG&quot;. The LFG flag
will remain active until you either enter a group or log out. Players can search
for other players who are LFG by using filters in the /who command. For
instance, to find rangers between level 40 and 50 who are looking for a group
across the server, type &quot;/who all ranger 40 50 lfg&quot;.<br>
<br>
It is our hope that this flag will make it easier for players to seek out group
members, allowing for more adventuring with less preparation time.<br>
<br>
Updated EQCLIENT.INI Documentation<br>
<br>
If the file does not exist it will be generated by eqgame.exe with default
values. If an entry in the file is missing it will be added by eqgame.exe with
default values.<br>
<br>
The [TextColors] section contains entries for various text colors in the client.
All colors are to be set with Red, Green, and Blue values, in decimal. Valid
settings for each color range between 0 and 255. &quot;Black&quot; (0 red, 0
green, and 0 blue) will be white in overlay mode, and black in normal mode.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of user colors to use as a guide when editing the file :<br>
<br>
1 - Say<br>
2 - Tell<br>
3 - Group<br>
4 - Guild<br>
5 - OOC<br>
6 - Auction<br>
7 - Shout<br>
8 - Emote<br>
9 - Spells (meming, scribing, casting, etc.)<br>
10 - You hit other<br>
11 - Other hits you<br>
12 - You miss other<br>
13 - Other misses you<br>
14 - Some broadcasts (duels)<br>
15 - Skills (ups, non-combat use, etc.)<br>
16 - Disciplines or special abilities<br>
17 - Unused at this time<br>
18 - Default text and stuff you type<br>
19 - Unused at this time<br>
20 - Merchant Offer Price<br>
21 - Merchant Buy/Sell<br>
22 - Your death message<br>
23 - Others death message<br>
24 - Other damage other<br>
25 - Other miss other<br>
26 - /who command<br>
27 - yell for help<br>
28 - Hit for non-melee<br>
29 - Spell worn off<br>
30 - Money splits<br>
31 - Loot message<br>
32 - Unused at this time<br>
<br>
The [Defaults] section contains some default setting for the client. Here is a
list of valid settings :<br>
<br>
RunMode - TRUE for run, FALSE for walk.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
ScreenMode - NORMAL for the dafault window view, FULL for the full view with
overlays</font></p>

message boards.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here's a quick run down of what I
have in the works (either done and on test or on my list to do soon) :</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Several / commands for common
things like /sit, /cast #, /doability #, /book #, /language #, and more</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Making it so you have a separate
friend/ignore list per server.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Making the log file be named based
on the character name.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Letting you control more text
colors.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Changing the &quot; begins
casting.&quot; message to read &quot; begins casting on &quot;.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Adding a &quot; has worn off
&quot; message for buffs you cast on people. (e.g. &quot;Symbol of Marzin has
warn off Rowyl.&quot;</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Making it so ctrl-1 thru ctrl-8
will cast the appropriate spell.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If I can, adding more pages of hot
buttons.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Changing it so moving open
contains can only be done by clicking the upper portion of the open container
area. At the same time I plan to look into making it so you don't &quot;click
thru&quot; things accidentally. Like when you have your inventory up and can
click between two slots and accidentally remove one of your buffs.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some things I can't or won't
change :</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The number of memmed spells shall
be 8, and 8 is the number of memmed spells. 9 or more is right out !</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I will not be making it so spells
can be interrupted &quot;instantly&quot; any time soon.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I will never change it so you can
see your exact mana amount or your exact experience amount. (However, we are
planning to redo the art for the bars so be much clearer and not have those
annoying bits over then first and last bubbles/bars.)</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some things that need further
discussion:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When you trade stuff and you don't
have room in your inventory, it currently (annoyingly in my opinion) drops the
stuff on the ground (for any scavengers (including those greedy NPCs) to grab).
One possible solution I was thinking of was to have it put you into
&quot;loot&quot; mode with the items traded on the left as if you are looting a
corpse once you both agree to the trade. This solves the problem, and allows you
to put the items from a trade where you want instead of the auto placement that
currently occurs. One minor down side is that it's an extra step for small
trades. However, I can make it not do this if the trade only involves money. So
let me know what you think.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The feature to be able to select
group members pets has an issue. If the pet is acquired via charm then it's
likely to not be selectable. If I can get around this I will, but I am assuming
you still wanted the feature even if it doesn't work for charmed pets, am I
right?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Okay, that's what's up in the near
term, I am sorry if a feature you wanted isn't mentioned above, it doesn't mean
that I'm ignoring you or that the feature won't get done. As I get the above
stuff done I will add more new ones. I am still going thru these messages and
noting features that I think need addressing.</font>

all,<br>
<br>
First, sorry about the void of information regarding the online store -- we've
not only been working on a total revamp of the store internally, but also have
been working with distributors.<br>
<br>
It's looking good at this point, and internally we've set a target date of
September 1 for the re-launch. The date isn't set in stone and we'll keep you up
to date as we get closer and closer. But at least there is light at the end of
the tunnel.<br>
<br>
We appreciate your patience in this matter,<br>

as a minor touch to the pet classes, could you implement a command that lets you
change the name of the pet? Might be kinda fun to do. :-)<br>
</font></span><br>
We couldn't allow people to choose the name of their own pet, as it would
increase the number of naming issues by an order of magnitude. Also, changing
the name of a pet after summoning isn't an option, due to the way that the zone
keeps track of NPCs. The only possible change that we could even look into would
be for people to choose an NPC name from a list of acceptable names, causing
future pets to be named in that fashion, however something like this isn't
likely to be prioritized anytime soon.</font></p>

message boards.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">My name is Roy, and I am a Senior
Programmer on the EQ Live team. My main focus for now is the client program
including the User Interface.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some of the first things I've done
are now live and I've seen the many reactions to them. I've been reading the
boards and even implemented some of the suggestions already (they will go onto
test tonight or tomorrow).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Be aware that while I am reading
the boards, I can not respond to everything. I will read what I can, and respond
when I can. If I were to spend the time needed to reply to everything, then I
would not have any time to code the changes and fixes needed. My boss would not
be too happy with me, if that were the case...</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hopefully, we can work together to
make the UI as good as it can be.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Spells being hot
keyed. I'm wondering if that might be possible. For example, a shaman might
right click some of his/her buffs into his/her hotkey lower left 6 pad. That way
he/she can cast these from the book, essentially, expanding the real estate of
those ever-important 8 spell slots. Casting from the spell book, even at 3x the
casting time, has been dismissed as impossible to implement, though perhaps I
wondered if a workaround might be to hotkey the icon into the presets so that
excessive spell-swapping is reduced. Some classes are more effected by the 8
spell limitation than others, and as the spells accumulate toward level 60, this
just worsens.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Having more then 8 spells from
your spell book available to cast at any one time is not part of EQ and unlikely
to change.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I'd just like to
suggest that, along with some of the other default options that are being tested
out right now, that you also insert the option to turn /log on or off by
default.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Log control has been added to the
eqclient.ini file already, should be on test soon.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just as a reminder, I am primarily
working on the UI, I won't be addressing issues such as class balance and
problems with quests or items&nbsp; Here's an update though:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Using activatable items from the
hot button panel is in and should be on test. I'm looking into why the hotkeys
don't operate from a key press while in the spell book.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Looking into the Ctrl-1 thru
Ctrl-8 for memmed spells.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The main issue with selecting
party members pets with the F keys is that the client doesn't currently track
the info. I will look into it and see if this can be done. As usual, no
promises.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Looking into the shift click while
buying to buy stacks of 20. One thing to keep in mind, if you don't have enough
money for all 20 it will just cancel the sale. This will only work on stackable
items.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">When emoting, the
text of the emote YOU typed used to be blue. But when others saw it, it was
white. Similarly, when you saw other's emotes, they were white. Now all emotes
are the same color.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I had to make &quot;classes&quot;
of text, and in order to keep it from being a separate color control entry in
the ini file for every text message printed (meaning hundreds of entries) I had
to group stuff together. I thought it made sense to put all emotes into a class
together. This reason applies to a lot of the messages.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">With my color
User_11 RGB as specified in Gordon's file, full red only, the text is still
WHITE on messages where others are hitting me. This is probably just a bug.&nbsp;
Wasn't the duel color (User_14) yellow?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Some of the messages are sent from
the server with a color tag, I have already fixed most of these and it should be
on test.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Was all spell
activity really dark blue? I must be losing my marbles, that seems wrong.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">See my response above.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">When you do
a /who friend all, your friends list comes back white, rather than the color of
all other friends queries (again, likely just a bug).<br>
</font><br>
The &quot;local&quot; /who command is handled by the client, the &quot;/who
all&quot; commands are all handled by the world server. Those will be colored
properly soon.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">How about letting
us right-clink on potions and items with effects that are in an open backpack
(you can only use a charged item that is in a general invent slot)?&nbsp; Or
letting us hotkey slots that are in backpacks</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Either of these
would help a ton, if you have 8 bags/large items in your general slots it
becomes very annoying to swap around your Jboots for a quick recharge.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just a note, hotkeying a backback
slot is just not possible.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Couple things I wanted to address:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cancelling a spell you already
cast and having to wait until the casting time is done is part of the game. If
you click the wrong spell you have to wait...</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I doubt I will be able to increase
the number of hot-buttons per page above 6 pages of 6 buttons. It would change
the player data format stored on the server, and that could cause serious
problems with character data. I might be able to make it 4 pages of 9 (still
having a total of 36 buttons, just more available at a time). I am still
investigating this one.. I'll let you know what comes up.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Several of the other things asked
for here are either in or going in this week. Like:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">/cast 1-8 for casting memmed
spells</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">/book # to open your book on page
#</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">/sit</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">/doability # (so if you have
tracking set on ability button 1, then /doability 1 would invoke tracking)</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">More control of certain text
message colors, the spell and target being mentioned in the &quot;casting&quot;
message</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Custom emotes that include the
target name (/em gives @ the look of death and @ is frozen in his tracks would
replace the '@' with the current target)</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;and more... some of these
are on test already, and some will be there later this week.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">What kind of
answer is &quot;Cancelling a spell you already cast and having to wait until the
casting time is done is part of the game.&quot; I have seen many things that
were &quot;part of the game&quot; that were altered to suit to the players needs
and requests. To me that like telling a warrior once you start attacking a mob
you can't stop until X amount of time has gone by before you can take another
action.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">It more than an
inconvenience, you cannot pick another target, you cannot switch thru your
hotkeys, you have to run around sometimes to keep the spell from going of and
sometimes it will still go off. I have never known an RPG that did not allow for
you cancelling or stopping a spell or ability that is not an instantaneous
affect.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Then you turn
around and say you are making these other changes for casting spells and
hotkeys, makes it sound like a double standard to me.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just to reply to the people that
didn't like my reply about stopping spells.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's part of the game. If you
click the wrong spell, it's a penalty that you have to wait thru. I'm sorry that
it's not the way you would like it, but there have to be drawbacks to making
mistakes. And I realize that sometimes it's not a mistake so much as the
situation changing after you cast.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I play a caster, and I would like
to make this change, also, but it's just something I have control over. The
designers of the game want it this way.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I know you stated:&nbsp;
&quot;The main issue with selecting party members pets with the F keys is that
the client doesn't currently track the info. I will look into it and see if this
can be done. As usual, no promises.&quot;</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Abashi has stated
this as well, but many know this to simply not be true. I have seen Show in
action (don't use it myself because in my opinion takes half the fun out of the
game), and this does track a pet to it's owner. Since the program just sniffs
packets it can't do any of this on it's own. Meaning that pets are indeed
tracked with their owners. If anyone tells you otherwise, check it out for
yourself.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am familiar with ShowEQ, and how
it does it's pet stuff. The pet does have the ID of it's owner in it's packet,
but player packets don't have the ID of their pet. What needs to be done is that
the client needs to search the current mob database for any pets that belong to
people in the current party. For your own pet it does this when you create it.
The client also needs to keep updating this info as your party changes and as
your party members create and destroy pets (either via pet spells or charm).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, ShowEQ is just going thru
it's entire database and when if find s a pet it sticks it under the pets owner,
but as I've explained above it's not the same as tracking the pets for the
functionality asked for in this thread. That said, I still plan to look into
this feature because I think it would be useful.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">In the higher
resolution modes 1024x768 for example when I'm in full screen with the display
in transparent overlays, there's a huge amount of wasted space in the text box.&nbsp;
Is it possible to either allow the characters to go the full width of the box
and add extra lines of text display?&nbsp; Or at least shrink the box and remove
the extra spaces between the lines to remove the amount of the screen it blocks
out?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Regarding the text box in higher
resolutions.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One of the other programmers here
is working on that right now. It's not as simple as one might think at first
glance because users can and do switch modes back and forth (sometimes they are
forced to by the game itself like for inventory mode), and thus the text needs
to be &quot;re-wrapped&quot; for the narrower box when in that mode, and then
expanded back out when you return to the higher res fullview. It's almost
working though and should be on test later this week.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Three suggestions
that have been drifting around a bit for the spell books:</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">A first and last
page button would be great!</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">User customizable
tabs/bookmarks would be an awesome improvement</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Being able to
duplicate spell icons (related to above suggestion) would be amazing: Why? So we
can plan out different 'load outs' or whatever for our spells for different
situations (i.e.: group section, ungrouped section, travelling section...)&nbsp;
Certain spells will invariably be in all 'configurations' (not sure if I'm being
clear here...)</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Thanks for the
colour customization! That was great....except I managed to make mine worse hee
hee...but eventually I'll have my own perfect scheme.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am working on a /book command
that will bring up your book, I plan to allow you to specify a page number with
that and have it pop open on that page. So /book 5 would open the book with page
5 visible. This should allow you to get to any page in your book easily.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Duplicate spells icons in the book
is not an easy thing, I'll peek at it, but doubt it will get done.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Would it be
possible for you to make it so we can have the GUI overlays in 800x600 and
1024x768 Full screen ? Maybe through an optional download ? I imagine these
files are BMP files and the size of a 1024x768 BMP would be pretty large, but it
would help a lot.. Some people like to play with the GUI on and in high
resolutions.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Part of the GUI overhaul for
Velious will likely involve something along these lines, but because of the new
art and data changes for that it won't be until Velious.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">It would be cool
if guild masters and maybe officers could set a text message that is stored
server side and played back to guild members whenever they log on to EQ. Here's
an example:-</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Welcome to
EverQuest!<br>
Message of the Day: [The usual EverQuest message of the day in yellow text]<br>
Guild Message of the Day: [Tindi'Losi] Reminder - Fear raid on Monday, insertion
starting 0900 EST at Feerrott portal! Also, everyone please welcome your new
guildmate Xyzzy, a level 34 druid who joined us yesterday.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">This would be a
very effective way for guilds to communicate, post reminders, make important
announcements etc. Right now, whenever there's an important announcement people
struggle with /guildsay and web boards, and 48 hours later half the guild still
hasn't heard it.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">It would also be
cool to have a /guildmotd command that would play back the message on request at
any time.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">A guild
&quot;message of the day&quot; would be a great addition to the guild
functionality of EverQuest</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am going to look into this one,
I think it's a great idea. I will say this though, it seems like it might be
easy at first glance, but it's not a trivial thing to add new data to be stored
on the server and delivered to select users.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Anyway, I'll see what I can do.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">A little thing
that would make things a lot smoother for me anyway, are more keyboard
shortcuts/hotkeys for those of us who use the keyboard and the mouse.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">For instance, in
inventory when I open up a backpack, and am done with it or realize it's not the
right one and want to close it, it'd be nice to just press <ENTER>
and have it close rather than have to click it. Same thing for trades and such.
Using <ENTER>
to confirm the trade and <ESC>
to cancel would be nice.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Also, more pages
for hotkeys would be nice... Maybe 10 (0-9) pages instead of just 6 (1-6).</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Lastly, and this
may go into gameplay a bit, but a second rack for memorized spells would be
nice. After a few levels, there are often MANY different spells at your disposal
and only 8 slots to memorize them to. The number of spells is a selling point
for the game, so why not make it to where you can use more of them. Maybe make
it so that you get more mem slots every few levels... Make them work kind of
like the aforementioned pages of hotkeys... Maybe <SHIFT>
+ 0 can toggle between the spell lists, or <BACKSPACE>
if it's not used for anything. *SHRUG* Besides, it will still take a good while
to mem all those spells initially, so it shouldn't be too unbalancing.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I like the idea of using <ENTER>
and <ESC>
for more things, but it can also cause problems. For example, since you can chat
while trading I can't make <ENTER>
confirm the trade since you might just be hitting <ENTER>
to end your line of chat. Same for <ESC>
you might just be cancelling a chat line. However, I plan to try and add more
keyboard shortcuts for thing where I can.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I am already looking into the
&quot;more hot button pages&quot; idea.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Having only 8 memmed spells is
part of EQ and changing that is highly unlikely to happen. I won't say never,
because one should never say never, but think of it like that.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">'You must be
standing in order to cast a spell'. Why don't we automatically stand up whenever
we hit a spell icon? It doesn't seem to make any sense that we have to manually
stand and then cast a spell. If I click on a spell button, then I wanted to cast
a spell so standing should happen automatically.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">From a precedent
setting perspective, if we are attacked by a mob while sitting we automatically
stand.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'll ask about this at the next
tuning meeting. While I don't see a problem with it, there may be reasons I am
not aware of that would stop us from doing this.</font>

hunting, or if it's been in a few specific areas, but you might consider trying
another areas out. There are some spells, for instance, that don't drop in all
areas. If you've been hanging out in a few that have higher spell drops for the
other classes, perhaps you've missed any areas that might have higher
percentages of mage spells.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Summon food and items are intentionally
less-reliable than &quot;real&quot; items of the same nature. It's one of the
balancing factors for having them there to begin with. Now it was never the
intention for people to lose them when accidentally going LD, however LDs remain
a part of life on the internet, and there's no way to determine the difference
between an accidental and intentional LD. There was one time when we allowed
people to keep summoned items for an LD, but had to change it when we noticed
our LD logs increase exponentially for the purpose of keeping the summoned
items.</font>
