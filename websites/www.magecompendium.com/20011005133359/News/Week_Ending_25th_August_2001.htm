<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hi all.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As some of you have noticed, we've
had an error in the point totals since the last patch. We were totaling points
for killing characters under 20th level. This happened for about a week (between
the last two patches, more or less).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The points have been adding up
properly for a few days, so the daily scores are right. But we're going to have
to recalculate all the total points to get rid of the goofy points from last
week. So if you see some changes to the point totals tomorrow, that's why.</font>

message boards.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I realize I sent
these questions earlier, but I haven't seen a response While the issue of the
&quot;Examine&quot; option has been discussed, I haven't seen a leaning to
keeping it and was wondering if I am one of the few that feel this option should
be removed.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The questions are:</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">1. Will we be
allowed to have identical names? (Are there not many Johns in the world?)</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nope. Sure, it's possible to have
the same name as someone else in real life. But there are two reasons why it
can't happen in Norrath. Character models are not people. I have several friends
named Brian, and I can tell one from another at a hundred paces pretty easily.
Unfortunately in Norrath that's not as easy. Names help to differential
characters.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But more importantly, having the
same name as someone else would be a real mess. It helps a lot if every
character has a unique name so the server can tell one of you from another.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">2. What are the
penalties for not Rping? What are the guidelines for being in character? (I am
tired of being berated by people who say - what level are you and then scoff
when I say I am 18th season or I am in my 18th cycle of training. Or have names
like Illeatyourliver or Priesto).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, that's the real meat of the
whole debate, for me at least.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you can describe to me how to
distinguish roleplaying from not roleplaying definitively in every instance,
then I'll come up with a set of punishments.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">3. Is it even
being considered to do away with the examine option? If someone wants to see
what I have on - they can look at my picture or ask me. Perhaps, make it so if
someone wants to examine they need your permission. I equate someone examining
me as the same as going through my clothes, lifting my cloak out of the way to
see my tunic, etc. . . and I feel that is rude (As do everyone who asks
permission to examine and doesn't just examine at will) and in no way necessary
to a total RP server.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another endless argument. The
emotional response to being inspected can't be overcome. But inspection is in
the game because it allows characters to 'see' what they should already be able
to see that isn't displayed by the game engine. Yes, you CAN see a tunic under a
cloak, unless the wearer of that cloak is spending all of his time holding it
tightly closed with both hands. And, well, in Norrath you can't even see that
cloak. Inspection allows people to actually see what you are wearing. If you
find that rude, then it is probably best that you turn off your inspection
messages.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let's not get into this debate
again, since it's one of those that just never ends…</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">4. While I agree
that for religion it would be most unlikely that an Iksar would worship a
Halfling god, I do not think it is too far fetched to believe the same Iksar
would not believe in any god. (Right now, if you are an Iksar - you believe in
Cazic-Thule) Can you make it so every race has at least have the option of being
agnostic? (Clerics, Paladins, Shadow Knights and Necromancers aside of course)</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The world of Norrath is largely
built with some assumptions in mind. Player character Iksar, for example, all
worship Cazic-Thule. Those that do not are outcasts. While there are certainly
some valid and interesting ideas about allowing PCs to play outcasts, setting
that up isn't as easy as just flipping a switch. We'd have to redesign a whole
bunch of stuff. After all, such Iksar would be KOS in Cabilis.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The same pretty much goes for all
of the other requests for changes (Gnome Shadowknights, Dwarven Bards, X race
worshipping Y god…). It's not that there is no way that such a thing could
happen. It's just that Norrath exists with things as they are and such changes
wouldn't necessarily be improvements, they'd just be changes.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Again these are a
repeat of the questions I asked earlier, but haven't seen any answer in the
previous postings. (Plus I hope to put the RP Server News discussion back near
the top.)</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Thanks and keep up
the good work.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sorry I missed it the first time.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And for the many that have asked,
we don't have an e.t.a. for this server yet. I'll announce it the moment I have
one.</font>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My characters have
been transferred, and thank you very much for the service.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">One thing I didn't
know - ALL my hotkeys are gone. I know they're stored on users PCs, not servers,
so is there a way for me to map the appropriate file that contains all my
hotkeys to the character on the new server.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your hot keys and other
information for each character is stored in an *.opt file.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For example: absor_02.opt</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The _02 is the number of the
server the character is on.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now that you've had your character
moved to a new server you should see two *.opt files with that character's name
on them in your EverQuest directory.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, make a copy of both files
to someplace in another directory, so you can replace them if my advice turns
out to be goofy…</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then just figure out which file is
the older one. That file should be the one from your old server, with your old
information on it. Delete the newer *.opt file and rename the old one to match
the new one.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For example.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">absor_02.opt Dated 3-3-2000<br>
absor_34.opt Dated 8-19-2001</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The _34 must be the new file for
the character on the new server (make sure to log into the character once, or
this file might not exist).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I would delete the absor_34.opt
file and rename the absor_02.opt file as absor_34.opt</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I haven't tried this myself,
but it should work. And if it goes all wrong, just copy and paste the reserve
files back into the directory.</font>

<br>
- Fixed the problem that was causing zones to crash in some instances.</font></p>

- Corrected a bug that would cause some people to hang up while waiting for a sound event between the splash and character-select screens.<br>
<br>
Item Change<br>
<br>
- The Green Flower should be working again.<br>
<br>
Spell Change<br>
<br>
- Fixed a stacking bug that allowed multiple Levitation buffs to stack.<br>
<br>
Sullon Zek Changes<br>
<br>
-  The Resist code changes we made with the last patch should be working properly now.  Here is the text about that change:<br>
<br>
"Changed the way resists are calculated when a Player Character casts a spell on another Player Character on Sullon Zek.  Resist modifiers based on level will now be more smoothly distributed and will allow lower level characters a slightly better chance to land spells on higher level characters.  At the same time giving lower level characters a slightly better chance to resist spells cast on them by higher level characters."<br>
<br>
- Cancel Magic spells should now work across teams.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Characters should no longer disappear when Mesmerized or stunned.</font></p>
