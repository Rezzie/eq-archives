  Now ta speak with the stone ye need somethin ta focus on. Use this piece o

  like the stone. Rock looks like it don't move but it does, just real slow. So
  place yer focus on the stones ye wish ta speak with and get yerself real slow,
  both yer body an yer noggin. Then if yer quiet enough ye might hear 'em. An

<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Phenocryst speaks with a soundless voice, as if
  you are hearing your own thoughts. 'We sense you are attempting communication
  with us but do not understand what it is you are trying to convey. We are
  eager to know more. Perhaps there is one who knows the language of the stone
  and will speak with us'</font>

<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Then you give him the Velium Focus.</font>

</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Phenocryst speaks to you from within your mind,
  'You know the stone! This is wonderful! The fulfillment of the prophecy is
  now one step closer. The most ancient of the stone tells us that one not of
  stone will come forth and act as our harbinger of ascension. We believe you
  to be our harbinger. Please help us!'</font>

<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Phenocryst speaks from within your mind as well
  as conveys a sense of joy empathically. 'It is said that the harbinger will
  find all of our people and unite them. When we join we will know all of our
  experiences and perhaps then be aware of how to proceed with the next step in
  our ascension. We implore you to find others like us and make them aware of
  us. You know the language of the stone and can tell them. We await your return
  with proof that you have spoken to them.&quot;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Now you have to go to Crystal Caverns.&nbsp; If
  you invis up and head down into the caverns, you'll pass through an orc area,
  then a dwarf area, then a tentacle terror and spiders area, and finally
  there's a long stretch of tunnel leading up to a zone out point.&nbsp; That
  long stretch of tunnel is filled with geonids and they con the same as the
  ones in Wakening Land.&nbsp; Give one of them the focus (any one, doesn't
  matter, you don't have to hail them or anything) and you'll get it back with
  the following message:</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">A geonid seems as if it doesn't recognize you as
  anything of importance. You attempt to speak with the geonid through your
  velium focus but all you are able to hear is the same though over and over..,
  Eat. You have gained no knowledge from these creatures but you notice your
  focus has been altered slightly.</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">The description on the focus doesn't change, but
  it is altered.&nbsp; Take it back to Phenocryst in Wakening Land and give it
  to him.&nbsp; The following will happen:</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Phenocryst sends it's thoughts to you, a feeling
  of disappointment washes over you, 'It seems the others are not aware of
  themselves yet. We are alone... So many questions yet we can find no answers. We
  have been given a very special gift but without direction we are lost. We must
  find who has made us aware of ourselves and why it has done so.'</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">You say to Phenocryst, &quot;Find what?&quot;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Phenocryst says in the form of thoughts, 'We
  must call to it. We must make ourselves heard past these rocks though. A
  menhir must be constructed to amplify our voice. The stones we will need are
  not found in this area though. We hear whispers of stones far away that have
  the ability to channel and amplify our thoughts. We ask you to gather these
  stones for us harbinger.&quot;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">You say to Phenocryst, &quot;I will gather these
  stones for you.&quot;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Phenocryst's thoughts flood your mind, 'Thank
  you Harbinger. We need 3 crystals. One of Beryl, one of Stibnite, and one of
  the purest Iron. These minerals will only be found deep within the earth where
  the geology is relatively stable. This Focus will aid you in finding the right
  crystals. Return it to me with the 3 crystals and we will construct our Menhir.
  Please hurry Harbinger, our prophecy awaits.</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Phenocryst gives you an item for telling him
  you'll gather the stones.&nbsp; It's a magic, lore, no drop Elbaite Focus that
  has 5 charges of Identify.&nbsp; It looks like a fire emerald.</font>
  <p align="center"><img border="0" src="Images/Elbaite_Focus.jpg" width="315" height="129"></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The stibnite crystal is found in The Great
  Divide.&nbsp; If you enter the wurm caves in the center of that zone from the
  south, go up to the first right, go in and take the next right, you'll be in a
  room with two spawn points for wurms and there's a patch of blue crystal at
  the back of the room.&nbsp; The stibnite is behind the crystals and looks like
  a bag on the floor.&nbsp; It spawns every 1-2 hours or so I think. When you identify it, it identifies
  as &quot;Stibnite for the Menhir&quot;. To identify an item using the
  Elbaite Focus, target yourself, pick up the item and right click it on the
  Elbaite Focus in your inventory.&nbsp; It won't change the description of the
  item, it'll just tell you what it is in your chat window.</font></p>

  <font face="Verdana" size="2">The Beryl crystal is in Split Paw.&nbsp;This
  crystal can be found in the room with two earthen pillars near the water
  leading to Ishva's spawn, it is just behind the second pillar at +690, -17.&nbsp; The spawn time here is
  probably the same. It
  identifies as &quot;Beryl for the Menhir&quot;.</font>

<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Take these three crystals and the Elbaite Focus
  back to Wakening Lands to Phenocryst and you're ready for the next step.&nbsp;
  Get 1-2 parties of 50+ players and bring them with you.&nbsp; Due to the dragon
  that spawns in Wakening Land near the dragon portal, you might want to
  approach from Skyshrine.&nbsp; If you're going along the wall from Skyshrine towards the caves, you want to gather your troops at the second cave entrance
  along the wall.&nbsp;Phenocryst is closest to that entrance.&nbsp; Get to
  know the path between you and him at this point so you're familiar with how to
  get out in a hurry.&nbsp; At this point, all the geonids should con amiable to
  you.&nbsp; Finishing the Velium Focus section achieves this faction
  adjustment.&nbsp; Make sure you have a ranger in your party of friends.&nbsp;
  You're going to have to track down some triggered MOBs and fight them.</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">You submit the items to Phenocryst.</font>

  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Phenocryst makes no sound but it's voice fills
  your mind. 'We have always held our memories within the earth and stone but
  only recently have we become aware of them.&nbsp; We do not know what happened
  or who gave us this wonderful gift but we can now access those memories and
  are aware of it's storage.&nbsp; With that knowledge has come questions and
  desires.&nbsp; When the prophecy comes to be then we will have our answers and
  fulfill our desires.'</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Phenocryst 's familiar thoughts flood into your
  mind again, 'You truly are the Harbinger, take this Focus as a mark of your
  friendship with us. Now we can construct the Menhir, we need ..,..,the stones
  speak.., There is a problem. Ones of flesh are coming, the large ones, 3 of
  them. They must not disturb us while we construct the Menhir! Please stop them
  Harbinger! bring us proof of their destruction along with your Focus and then
  we will begin the calling. Our ascension is at hand!'</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">You lose the focus and the three crystals and in
  return gain another focus item with the description &quot;Azurite Focus&quot;.&nbsp;
  It's a magic, lore, no drop item weighing 0.5.</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Now head outside and start tracking.&nbsp; After
  a few minutes, two &quot;accolyte of Zek&quot; giants will show up on track. A
  minute later or so, a Bloodpriest Loukond will show up on tracker as well.&nbsp;
  You'll have to run out and pull the accolytes to you once you track them.&nbsp;
  If they are snared, they still run quite fast.&nbsp; These giants con blue at
  52 and are quite magic resistant.&nbsp; Make sure you pull these, they're
  almost more important than the Bloodpriest.&nbsp; They get attacked by the
  various mercenaries in the zone sometimes and get killed before you can do the
  job.&nbsp; If you have to pull mercenaries with the accolytes, do.&nbsp; After
  killing both accolytes, loot them.&nbsp; Each one has a medallion that has the
  description, &quot;Holy Symbol of Zek&quot;, which is magic, no drop, and
  weighs 2.0.&nbsp; After the acolytes are done, go out and get the Bloodpriest.&nbsp;
  Bloodpriest Loukond should eventually walk up to the cave entrance and stand
  outside it if nobody pulls it.&nbsp; After a minute of standing outside the
  cave, he depops, which is why you have to do the accolytes first (they pop
  first) then the bloodpriest (he'll get to the cave probably if you can't find
  him, the accolytes might not).&nbsp; The bloodpriest cons blue at 52 and is
  just as magic resistant.&nbsp; He drops a third and final medallion with the
  same description.&nbsp; You must get all three medallions in order to for this
  part to prove fruitful.&nbsp; When you kill the giants, you take the following
  faction hits: Kromzek (Worse), Kromrif (Worse), KingTormax (Worse), and
  ClawsofVeeshan (Better).&nbsp; The giants never enter the caves to attack the
  geonids or anything.&nbsp; Everything will happen outside the caves and the
  giants won't aggro the dragon if it's up either.&nbsp; The Bloodpriest Loukond
  is also not to be confused with Priest Bjek, another giant who wanders in the
  area sometimes who is red at 52 and not related to this quest.</font>

<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font>
</div>
<div>
  <font face="Verdana" size="2">Now. Take your Azurite Focus and the three medallions
