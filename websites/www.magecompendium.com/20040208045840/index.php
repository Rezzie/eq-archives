Make sure you check it out.<br><br>- Charm spell change: If an NPC is in the middle of casting a spell when charm is broken, it will interrupt the spell.<br><br>- Some general bug fixes.<br><br>Make sure you log onto the Test server to see what other changes we are cooking up.

<td width="100%"><font size="2">We have made a few changes to remove some exploits in our continuing effort to do remove any loopholes in EverQuest.  In this update we have removed the charm exploit in Plane of Tactics by changing the way that charm works.  This change should not affect those who use charm in the manner for which it was intended.  We have also changed the profit margin of many tradeskill items when sold to NPC vendors.  It is our hope that these changes and your continued community efforts will help to put a stop to those who do not wish to play fairly.  <br><br>- Changed Charm spells so that NPCs spell use will now be interrupted once the charm has expired.<br><br>- We have modified the sell back value on many tradeskill items to prevent excessive profit.<br><br>- Please note that many items will now show as being usable by berserkers.  This does not necessarily mean the items will be equippable by berserkers when Gates of Discord launches.<br><br>** Gates of Discord **<br><br>www.gatesofdiscord.com<br><br>The latest expansion to EverQuest - Gates of Discord - is available for pre-order and incremental download&#33;<br><br>Be the first in your guild to pre-order Gates and begin the incremental download now&#33;  This new expansion boasts:<br><br>-100 new Alternate Advancement abilities. <br>-Leadership experience to unlock many group- and raid-enhancing tools.<br>-20 new zones -- 10 new instanced zones and 10 new traditional zones, including a huge ship city zone to gather your party and launch expeditions.

It is a lot easier to download these files in smaller chunks than to download them all on the day of release.<br><br>You can get the files incrementally from the EverQuest updater. The obvious way to begin downloading the files is to click "yes" when the dialogue box pops up asking you if you&#39;d like to incrementally download Gates. If you&#39;ve already told that dialogue never to appear again, you can get the files in a few easy steps:<br><br>- Run the EverQuest Updater<br>- Click the Advanced button<br>- Click the checkbox next to Gates of Discord<br>- Click Save<br>- Click Download.<br><br>This will catch you up on the downloads you have missed and will update you as we add files to the updater. This will make your download much smaller the day Gates launches, or the day you purchase the digital version of the expansion.<br><br>The anticipated release date -- February 10th, 2004 -- is subject to change.  If the anticipated release date changes, we will announce a recised release date via a patch message.</font><br><br></td>

They still have a re-use timer, and they can&#39;t be used more often than the timer allows.  <br><br>Disciplines have now been divided into a few different timers.<br><br>We have also added a few of the new melee skills to the game.  These are the skills that do not use the new "opening" system, but can be used without an opening present.  The "reactionary" skills and the opening system will remain on Test for further tuning.<br><br>Warriors have been given a mitigation boost.

To play you will need to buy a King&#39;s Court Token.  You then take this token and turn it in to any of the dealers.  Based on what your hand turns out to be, you will be awarded a prize.  The highest hands will return a gold ticket as the prize.  This Ticket can be turned in to win prizes such as a Guise of the Deceiver, Fungus Covered Great Staff, or Holgresh Elder Beads. Good luck to all that play&#33;<br><br>** Items **<br><br>- Purchased augments, that have not been bound to an item yet, can be sold back to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro.<br><br>- Caerlyna in the Bazaar will trade your containers for tokens and will trade tokens for containers.  This will allow player characters to sell those tokens in the Bazaar.  Folks that buy the tokens can then take them to the Caerlyna and trade them in for the appropriate container.  You can exchange most weight reducing tradeable containers for a token.<br><br>- We&#39;ve changed the +12 Wis on the Copper Medal of Rapture to +12 Int.  Really, we have&#33;<br><br>- We have lowered the minimum duration to 5 ticks on Affliction Efficiency I-IV and Affliction Haste I-IV foci.<br><br>- Timeless Coral Greatsword will no longer claim to be out of charges when it procs.  If you own one of these swords, you will need to petition a GM and ask them to replace your current Coral Greatsword with a new one.<br><br>- Phylactery is no longer useable by all classes, only MAG NEC ENC WIZ CLR SHA DRU.<br><br>- The Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic now only procs for characters level 35 and above.<br><br>- The following items that had the Invigor effect now have Serpent Sight or Ultravision: Orb of the Crimson Bull, Abram&#39;s Axe of the Stoic, Tolan&#39;s Darkwood Boots, Mrylokar&#39;s Greaves, Singing Steel Vambraces, Crown of Rile, 5 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 5 Dose Potion of Fleeting Languor, 10 Dose Potion of Wolves Blood, 10 Dose Potion of Fleeting Languor, Potion of Wolves Blood, Potion of Fleeting Languor, Spiroc Wingblade, Spirit Caller&#39;s Boots, Spirit Weaver&#39;s Boots, Frozen Efreeti Boots, Ring of the Crimson Bull, Rune Crafter&#39;s Boots, Wolf Caller&#39;s Boots and Camii&#39;s Bracer of Vigor.<br><br>- The effects on Abram&#39;s Axe of the Stoic and Spiroc Wingblade are now Worn to activate, not procs.<br><br>** Spells/Songs **<br><br>- New spell effects&#33;  Just about every spell in the game has been given a new spell effect.  If you have your spell effects turned off, you may want to turn them back on.<br><br>- Fixed the bard AA Channeling Focus.  It was allowing 100% recovery from missed notes in most instances.  We have restored it to the 5%/10%/15% values as documented in the AA window.<br><br>- Fixed a problem with short-duration pets (Rage of Zomm, cleric hammers, wizard flaming swords and such) so that they will no longer dissipate before engaging the target NPC.<br><br>- Reclaim Energy will now return 75 percent of the mana used to summon the pet, 95 percent if the caster has Improved Reclaim Energy.<br><br>- Lull spells with duration less than 5 should no longer be lasting as if they had duration 5.  This will reduce the duration of some lull-type spells to their proper duration.<br><br>- Fixed a problem that caused Protection of the Nine to block Blessing of the Nine.<br><br>- We corrected an issue where the same druid damage over-time spell cast on an NPC by two different druids would not stack. <br><br>- Bulwark of Vie was reducing spell damage as well as melee damage.  It now only reduces melee damage.<br><br>- Eye of Zomm will no longer cause players summoned pets to suicide if commanded to kill the eye.<br><br>- Improved the melee damage on pets focused by Ritual Summoning.<br><br>- The magician epic pet can now Enrage when focused by Minion of Darkness.<br><br>- Increased the offensive capabilities of most pets when focused by Summoner&#39;s Boon.<br><br>- We have removed the Stamina effects from many spells.<br><br>- Fixed a bug that would cause issues with pet hit points, and could cause them to be unable to move if their hit points got too low.  This may also address other issues with pets using hit-point boosting items.<br><br>** Alternate Advancement **<br><br>- Extended Notes 3 and Sionachie&#39;s Cresendo have been refunded.  If you had these bard AAs and were close to 30 AA points stored, make certain that you spend enough points to have 30 or less unspent AA points before you zone.  All AA points over 30 are removed when you zone.  You may, of course, repurchase these AAs.<br><br>- Extended Notes and Sionachie&#39;s Cresendo no longer affects harmful area-of-effect spells.<br><br>- Jamfest has been fixed.  It will now affect the bard&#39;s group, not just the bard.<br><br>- The Archetype AA ability Spell Casting Deftness was not reducing the casting time for the wizard spell Harvest.  It does now.<br><br>** Tradeskills **<br><br>- Merchants will not pay more for a tradeskill product than the cost of the components needed to make it.  However, they will still sell those products for the same amount.<br><br>** Zones and Quests **<br><br>- Maelin will now respond as though you have the Quintessence, as long as you are flagged for time.  It is also now possible to receive any of the earlier progression flags, even if you have already earned access to the Plane of Time.<br><br>** User Interface **<br><br>- Tell windows now log the name of the person sending tells in the chat log.<br><br>- Tell windows now blink when a tell is received, even when the window is not minimized.<br><br>- Fixed a problem that caused users some ATI cards to be unable to see the /find path or the targeting ring.<br><br>- We have added a new combat ability windown which allows you to make up to eight hot keys for disciplines and other new melee abilities and displays any current melee effects.  The window can be opened by pressing Alt+C.  The keys are accessible using either the mouse or Ctrl+1-8.<br><br>** Miscellaneous **<br><br>- Added some explanation text to the targetindicator.ini file that help explain how to modify the targeting ring.<br><br>** UI Files ** <br><br>AttackIndicator.tga<br>EQUI.xml<br>EQUI_CharacterCreate.xml<br>EQUI_CombatAbilityWnd.xml<br>EQUI_CombatSkillsSelectWnd.xml<br>EQUI_GroupSearchWnd.xml<br>EQUI_PlayerWindow.xml<br>EQUI_SkillsWnd.xml</font><br><br></td>

<tr>
<td width="100%"><font size="2">Over the last few days there has been a growing community concern about possible cheating, exploiting and platinum duplication.  Rumors and speculation have begun to run rampant, and I&#39;ve received a lot of concerned email on the topic.<br><br>First of all, I want to thank you for your concern.  The fact that you worry about this stuff as much as we do makes me feel good about the community that I work for.  I want to especially thank those that have sent in detailed information about what they thought might be dupe or exploit situations.  That information has been very helpful.<br><br>With your help, we have been able to discover and eliminate some unusual ways of cheating.  Obviously I can&#39;t go into detail about exactly how this cheating was done.  I can tell you that several of our programmers and designers took lengthy breaks from working on their current tasks to define, investigate and smash those exploits.  Most of these methods for cheating have been removed.  The few that remain will be fixed shortly.  We will be watching, and anyone using them will be banned.<br><br>At the same time, our Customer Service folks have been diligently tracking down the cheaters.  We have banned accounts and deleted characters in the hundreds.  It&#39;s never a good thing to be forced to remove so many accounts, and we&#39;re not happy that such cheating was possible.  We are pleased, however, to let you know that we are confident that we have located the majority of those that exploited the game and have removed their characters or accounts.<br><br>Obviously we won&#39;t be able to prevent all of the possible ways to cheat.  The folks that insist on trying to cheat have proven to be persistent and clever (and here is where I wonder why they don&#39;t apply that energy and skill to something beneficial...).  We need your help to locate these issues.  The multitude of eyes and ears of our players is always the best source of information for us.  If you ever suspect that you have discovered something that seems like an exploit, please send that information to us through the Developer&#39;s Corner AND through /bug.  Please don&#39;t assume we have heard the information already.  We&#39;d rather have ten reports about something like this than none.<br><br>I&#39;d also like to address a rumor about the nature of some of the cheating that people have been talking about.  There has been speculation in the community that in order to pull off some of the rumored exploits someone had to be working on the "inside".<br><br>We take such possibilities very seriously.  And we have investigated this very thoroughly.  We keep track of all special EverQuest commands issued.  We have looked into the possibility that someone working here had a hand in helping others cheat, and we have discovered no evidence that indicates that to be the case.  Also, the nature of the cheat did not require such inside help.  I can&#39;t describe the cheat method in any detail, but there was an experience cheat that allowed extremely fast leveling.  This required some rather sophisticated cheating, but was being done without inside help.  Obviously we have removed that exploit and banned any accounts that used it.<br><br>Thank you for playing EverQuest.  And thank you for you help making the game fun.<br><br>Have a great holiday season.<br><br>- Alan</font><br><br></td>

Obviously you can&#39;t have two items in the same hand, so if you place such an augment (specifically the Diamond Prism of Companionship) on you Ornate Orb, you will not be able to focus your epic pet. <br><br>If you currently have the Diamond Prism of Companionship bonded to your Ornate Orb of Mastery, you may petition your GM and they will reimburse the item for you. <br><br>There&#39;s some history behind this problem, but the message above is the important thing. <br><br>When the Diamond Prism was introduced, it was not intended to focus the epic pet, and some Mages placed them on their Ornate Orb of Mastery. Recently we changed the Prism to focus Mage epic pets, and thus this problem occurred. <br><br>- Alan</font><br><br></td>
