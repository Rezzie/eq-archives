<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Talon Southpaw was the fastest pugilist ever to
walk within the Court of Pain. His speed rivaled that of the great Grandmaster
Tynn. He could often be found within the local taverns demonstrating the awesome
speed of his fist.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Talon Southpaw came to rebirth within this
caste. Although quick with fist and tail, the speed of his left arm was not to
come to blossom for a couple decades past his rebirth. It was to follow his
captivity by the accursed Samak.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Soon after fulfilling the Rung of Tynn, Talon
went on a wandering retreat into the dangerous outlands of Kunark. He was not
seen from for a total of 5 seasons. Upon his return to Cabilis he told of his
captivity within an ancient city of Iksar now claimed by the Sarnak. He told of
intense torture. He survived the ordeal. He escaped from the claws of the Sarnak
with numerous scars which proved of his painful ordeal. Most of the worst scars
were never to be seen. Talon worn a robe which he never removed. The scars
underneath were for no lizards eyes. his great perseverance gave him an inner
strength no other monk could lay claim to.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He now possessed incredible, almost blinding
speed with his left arm. He could tap a foes arm with his left and strike with
as if having a third arm! He was indeed a paragon of the Swifttails. All the
empire under respected or feared him. None would spar him outside of the
taverns, with grog comes stupidity.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Upon his death in Kurn, Grandmaster Tynn
removed his hands in a private ceremony. Only Tynn was allowed to gaze upon
Talon's body. The fists were then sealed in a canopic which would stay within
the Tower of Kurn. His body was dusted. This is his tale as told by Rinmark.</font></p>
