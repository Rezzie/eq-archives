<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Something
caught my eye though, and it's the lack of specific Quest/Item info, on which
you stated you'd like some input, so here's my two cents :</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
It's a NPC that's always available, 'cause most people think he's just dropping
a head....<br>
<br>
+3 INT earrings :</font></p>

To be looted from Ghanex Drah, a Gnoll Necromancer that spawns every 15 minutes
at the border of the Skeleton camp in South Karana. He was blue to me at level
22, and if you hit him the instant he spawns he won't have time to summon his
skeleton pet. Hit him with a pet the moment he spawns (I just get my pet
guarding&nbsp; on the spawn spot, and&nbsp; you will not have any trouble
wasting him, even though he casts a spell on you that leaves you unable to
control yourself for a few seconds. The roars of my pet hitting on him while I
was tossed around the place just added more fun to the experience for me.. :-)</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
The items I looted from him are varying from jewelstones, cloth amour (like
large sleeves, trousers and caps), Crystal Knifes (4 Dmg magical Dagger) to +3
INT Golden Ear Studs.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
Since most of the high levels leave him alone as they run past to the Aviak
Village or the Treant spawn place, it was my ticket to&nbsp; level 23, killing
Elephants and wandering Aviak Darters and Rooks between spawns, whit the<br>
Stone Bridge to N - Karana conveniently close by.<br>
<br>
Hope to help some fellow Mages with this, and checking your page on a daily
basis from now on.</font></p>
