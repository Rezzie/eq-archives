<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This
quest to most will begin in Freeport East, but it actually begins in Oggok.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You
can, if you wish to begin in Oggok, but it is totally unnecessary.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you
do decide to begin in Oggok, then go up to Clurg, the bartender in the only
tavern of Oggok.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He will
say he is looking for his book of drinks.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now for
most of you, you won't go down to Oggok just to hear that so you will begin in
Freeport East.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Go to
the docks, and into the Seafarer's Roost.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hail
the bartender, Gregor Nasin, then talk to him about exotic ingredients.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
ingredients he is looking for are :</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Kiola
Nuts</font> - Immediately in front of the docks in The Ocean of Tears on Sisters
Island is a group of
huts. Go to the one that is right in front of the docks and there should be a
Elven woman named Cleonae Kalen behind a bar, she will sell you the Kiola nut.
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Erud's
Tonic (No Drop)</font> - Go to the Blue Hawk's Inn in Erudin and buy an
Innoruk's Kiss of Death (Lore Item) from Geord BlueHawk. Take the Kiss of Death
to Sinnkin Highbrow at the top of the Library in Erudin, and she will give you
Erud's Tonic.
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Honey
Jum</font> - Give the three Honeycombs and 30gp to Kizzie Mintopp in Rivervale
and she will give you the Honey Jum.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">Koalindl
Fish (No Drop)</font> - There's lots of the Koalindl fish swimming around near
the Temple of Life in Qeynos, so take one out. Be warned that the Koalindl fish
are social, so you may be fighting more than one at a time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Note
:</b></font> You can also get a Koalindl fish by killing Frostbite, a wolf in
the Barbarian Fishing village in the South West corner of The Western&nbsp;
Plaines of Karana. Also note that none of the NPCs near the fish like you
killing them so if they see you they will attack. You will also take a pretty
heavy faction hit for the worse with the good people of Qeynos.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you
get all the components, give them to Gregor Nasin in Freeport, get the
Bartenders Compendium.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Travel
to Oggok and give the Bartenders Compendium to </font><font size="2" face="Verdana">Clurg,
and finally get the Stein of Moggok.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Note
:</font></b> You have to have an Indifferent faction or above with Clurg to
obtain the Stein of Moggok.
