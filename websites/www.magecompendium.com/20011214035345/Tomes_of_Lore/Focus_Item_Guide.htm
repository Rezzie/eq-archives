<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I've completed *each* of the 4 focus staff quests about 3
times.&nbsp; They were kind of fun, and I did them all for friends.&nbsp; I am a
Wizard, but all of the items, except for the final staff, are droppable.<br>
<br>
1) Gargoyle Eyes.&nbsp; Forget about going to MistMoore for gargs.&nbsp;
Get them on the Grey Island in the OOT (Ocean of Tears).&nbsp;Gargs are about level
19, I believe, but they aggro on anyone (with the right faction).&nbsp; This island is located right next to the Oracle Island
(Which is right next to the Sisters of Erollisi island).&nbsp; You may even be able to buy
Gargoyle Eyes on the vendor on the Sisters isle, since the hunters for them will sell them on the island
(It's by far the closest merchant). Two shots of 309 damage, and down the gargoyle goes.<br>
<br>
2) Mermaid Scales.&nbsp; Get them in the OOT also.&nbsp; They are dropped
off of Alluring Sirens, which are very weak.&nbsp; One shot of 309 damage kills them.&nbsp; There are 3 of these mobs at the Twin Tines, and 5 or so of them
at the Sirens Rocks.&nbsp; Kill about 10 of them to get one scale (Spawn rate is pretty good, and no one camps them).<br>
<br>
3) Stein, Torch, Shovel, Broom.&nbsp; All of these items can be gotten
from The Lost Temple of Cazic - Thule.&nbsp; They are drops off of the alligators
in the Green Pool and the Sewers.&nbsp; I have always auctioned for them, and can get what I need in a few minutes.&nbsp; I pay 20pp for these, but mostly
because I am a nice guy =)&nbsp; You can surely get them for less.<br>
<br>
4) Fire Scale.&nbsp; From the Fire Drakes in Lavastorm. Too bad they
will pretty much resist Fire spells of you Mages.&nbsp; One shot of 309 Ice takes
them down.&nbsp; Had to kill about 10 of them to get one scale.<br>
<br>
5) Giant Toes.&nbsp; You thought these would be the hard ones to get,
didn't ya ? You lamented over not being able to get Fire and Frost Giant toes for a long time, didn't ya?&nbsp; Well, in the OOT, there is a named giant
called Gornit (Looks like a Hill Giant) that spawns in the water (About hip deep for him) on the Seafury Cyclops island.&nbsp; This island is in the
same general area as the Grey Isle (You can see it from there).&nbsp;Gornit drops ALL of the giant toes.&nbsp; His level range is the same as regular
HGs.&nbsp; He was camped when I went there, and the 2 Necros were more than happy to just give me the toes that they had collected
(Thanks guys!). Just watch out for wandering Seafury Cyclops (about level 38 to 42 and run as fast as SoW).<br>
<br>
Good luck with those staves, and remember that Wizards can be good friends!</font>
