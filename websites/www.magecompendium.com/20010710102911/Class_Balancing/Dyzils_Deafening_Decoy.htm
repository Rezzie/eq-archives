<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
claim is that it doesn't actually decoy very well. The ability for this pet to
taunt could be increased. There seems to be no reason that it can’t be a super
taunter. With its low hit points, letting it taunt the heck out of things
wouldn’t seem to overpower it. Though, if it’s going to be attacked so much
perhaps more hit points would not be out of line. Also, perhaps making it more
of an escape spell would be a good idea. Give it a very short casting time (2
seconds), so that magicians could summon it in bad situations real quick and
then run like heck. (Summary of requests for this spell: A lot more taunt, more
hit points, 2 second cast time).</font></p>
