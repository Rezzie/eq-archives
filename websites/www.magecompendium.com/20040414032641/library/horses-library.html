<P class=header2>Why do I want a Horse or Drogmor?</p>
<P>Three reasons.</P>

<P>One: Aggro free meditation. As long as you are not moving, you are meditating. However, mobs perceive you as standing and NOT sitting, and won't go out of their way to attack a caster thats standing. This benefit is HUGE, and worth the cost of a mount alone.</P>

<P>Two: "Permanent" meditation. As long as you are not moving and do not have attack on, you are meditating. You are also meditating WHILE you cast spells! This benefit is huge, especially for spells with very long cast time. This also decreases the amount of time needed to meditate in intense combat situation. This alone is also worth the cost of a mount.</P>

<P>Three: Travel. While the cheap horses aren't very fast (Run3 is faster than the Rope bridle for example), the more expensive ones are very fast. Chain bridles and Giant drums are <I><B>faster</B></I> than Spirit of Eagle, and are almost as fast as Spirit of Cheetah! Combined with a levitate effect and you can travel to places significantly faster than you otherwise could.</P>

<P class=header4>What do they look like?</P>

<P class=header4>Where can I buy a Horse?</p>
<P>Horses are sold in the stable, found in the Bazaar. </p>

<P class=header4>Where can I buy a Drogmor? </p>
<P>Drogmors are sold off a vendor in the Gulf of Gunthak. </p>

<P class=header4>How do I ride one? </p>
<P>Right click the Bridle or Drum in inventory. It will cast a 3 second spell. After three seconds you will be mounted. </p>

<P class=header4>How fast are they? </p>
<P>Mount speed are categorized by their price, and the type of drum/bridle. See below</p>

<P class=header4>Are their MOB droppable horses? </p>
<P>Yes. <BR>
Emperor Ssraeshza drops a White Ornate Chain Bridle. <BR>
Lord Inquisitor Seru drops a Black Ornate Chain Bridle <BR>
Several mobs in Ssraeshza Temple and Sanctus Seru have been known to drop Silk Bridles.<BR>
The Casino in Shadowhaven has been known to reward gamblers with White and Black Ornate Chain Bridles (Horse), as well as White and Black Glowing Drums (Drogmor)</p>

<P class=header4>Are their MOB droppable Drogmor drums? </p>
<P>None have been found yet. </p>

<P class=header4>Does color affect speed? </p>
<P>No. Color has absolutely no affect on speed. </p>

<P class=header4>How can I get mount for cheaper? </p>
<P>The best way is to increase your CHA stat. At approximately 130CHA, the horse and drogmor vendors will sell at their cheapest price. </p>

<P class=header4>Where can I ride a mount? </p>
<P>Mounts can only be ridden in outdoor zones. They cannot be used indoors. </p>

<P class=header4>Do any run speed effects change horse speed? </p>
<P>No. Mounts will always overwrite any run speed effects, such as Spirit of Wolf. However, levitate affects from spells such as Spirit of Eagle will take hold. </p>

<P class=header4>When I click my bridle or drum, it says I can't ride with the current models. Why? </p>
<P>Mounts can only be ridden if your character's Luclin models are turned on in options. Additionally, Horse and Elemental models must be turned on. </p>

<P class=header4>How do I get off my mount? </p>
<P>Either click the buff in your buff window, or type /dismount (/dism) </p>

<P class=header4>How can I hide this annoying horse head? </p>
<P>The most effective way is to shrink.</p>

<P class=header4>What is the difference between a Horse and a Drogmor? </p>
<P>The main difference is that a Drogmor's head does not block your view, while a Horse's head does. The animation is also different if you are riding a horse or a drogmor.</p>

<P class=header4>Is a mount considered a buff? </p>
<P>Not in the traditional sense. Mounts do take up a buff slot, but they cannot be dispelled like normal buffs. In affect, they are a permanent buff. </p>

<P class=header4>How do I meditate on a mount? </p>
<P>As long as you are not moving or attacking, you are meditating. </p>

<P class=header4>What about if i cast a spell? </p>
<P>Even while you are casting spells, you are meditating. </p>

<P class=header4>How do I interrupt my spell? </p>
<P>Move so that you cannot channel your spell. Additionally, you can dismount your horse and interrupt by ducking.</p>

<P class=header4>What other benefits are there to a mount?</P>

<UL><LI>No movement encumberance while on a mount. No matter what weight you are carrying, you can move as if unencumbered. This is VERY useful if you have to move heavy objects large distances</LI>
<LI>Innate Safefall of around 150. It works the same way in does for monks; you fall and if its between a certain distance you take no damage.</LI>
<LI>Food consumption is doubled. Hardly a benefit and more like a nuisance, but food consumption is doubled while on a mount. Luckily the AA Innate Metabolism helps combat this.</LI>
