This NPC has three different tasks which he will assign to you depending on your
faction. The firsts of these assignments will reward you with Engraved
Bone Pauldrons. If you tell him that you will accept his assignment he will
give you an order for a toolset. You must take this order to an NPC who is
standing outside of the room. If your faction is not high enough the NPC will
not give you the toolset.<br>
<br>
Upon attaining the toolset you will need to travel to the <b><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/icecladocean.html" target="Main"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF">Iceclad

at the gnome camp there. Hand him the toolset and he will hand you a note to
give back to the noble who sent you there. Return him the note and you will be
rewarded with the Engraved
Bone Pauldrons.</font></p>
