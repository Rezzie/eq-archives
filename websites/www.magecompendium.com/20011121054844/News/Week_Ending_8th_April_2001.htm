EverQuest Classic Edition<br>
<br>
There is a new package for EverQuest.  It's a small box with a small price.  Here's a bit from the press release for details:<br>
<br>
SAN DIEGO, CA - April 3, 2001 - Sony Online Entertainment announced today that its classic edition of EverQuest(tm) is now available for the SRP of $9.99, a price point that will attract new users to a continuously growing community. EverQuest, the most successful massively multiplayer online role-playing game ever, will be available in both a jewel case and mini box versions at retail stores nationwide. "Newbies" will enjoy all the amazing aspects of the original EverQuest from creating their own specialized characters to embarking on perilous and excitement filled journeys across three continents.<br>

<br>
New and Changed Features<br>
<br>
- Guild Message of the Day.  Guild Officers and Leaders will be able to type /guildmotd &lt;text> to set up a Guild Message of the Day (GMotD).  From then on any time a member of that guild logs in they will see the message with the name of the message sender added at the front, so you will know who sent the message.  Any guild member will also be able to read the GMotD by typing just /guildmotd and the message will be displayed again.  The GMotD will be erased if the server comes down, however.  You will have to reset the GMotD when the server comes back up.<br>
<br>
- /assist changed and improved.  It should be much more reliable now.  It also will target whatever the assisted person has targeted.  The assisted person does not need to have auto-attack on for /assist to work.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a problem with /corpse that kept it from working on corpses that were too far above or below you.<br>
<br>
Skill Change<br>
<br>
- Foraging changed so that if you are getting the hungry and thirsty messages, your next successful forage will always be drink or food.  We have also decreased the chance of foraging fishing grubs a bit and increased the chance that you will forage water.<br>
<br>
Spell Changes<br>
<br>
- Acumen now overwrites See Invisible.<br>
<br>
- Translocate now has the proper spell gem.<br>
<br>
Bug Fix<br>
<br>
- Fixed many crash problems for Windows 2000 users.  This fix will most likely also aid some folks that are not using Windows 2000 that are having problems.<br>
<br>
Item Changes<br>
<br>
- Velious racial plate helm quests have been added that will allow you to 'trade in' your existing helms for ones with textures.  We have decided to allow the players (or their characters) to chose whether they wish to have the new helmet textures or to continue to use helmets that show no graphics.<br>
<br>
- Five and ten charge versions of Potions of the Bone Field have been added.<br>
<br>
- Kilva's Skin of Flame potion has been changed.  It no longer has the same effect as the Kilva's Blistering Flesh potion.<br>
<br>
- Removed the tinting from Dark Forge and Resonant armors.  Tinting was never really intended to be on those pieces and, frankly, they look better without it.<br>
<br>
Miscellaneous Items<br>
<br>
- Reduced the 'bottleneck' for getting Howling Stone keys by increasing the availability of one of the quest items.<br>
<br>
- Erudite guards will now be much less friendly to Kobolds.<br>
<br>
- Vendors are once again selling the Coldain Tanner's Kit.<br>
<br>
'Combine' container changes<br>
<br>
We've made a change to 'combine' containers.  In order to prevent people from accidentally destroying items, all containers with a 'combine' button will not combine any items that do not form a complete recipe.  This will be a huge boon to craftspeople all across Norrath.  But this removes the only drawback to using trade containers as backpacks.  Their reduced weight and often greater carrying capacity made them more desirable as bags, with the compensating risk that you might just lose something if you made a mistake.<br>
<br>
We will be increasing the weight of portable 'combine' containers somewhat.  Where some of these containers weighed under 1 pound, they will now weigh as much as 4 pounds for the largest sewing kit.<br>
<br>
Along with this we are making a change to tailor made backpacks.  In case you didn't know, most tailor made packs have a built in weight reduction of 5%.  We are raising that to 10%.  We will also be displaying the weight reduction of all containers with the information shown on a right click.<br>

Second move log for E'ci and The Rathe<br>
<br>
Since there is still plenty of room on the new server, we will be opening a second move log for people to move from The Rathe and E'ci to Zebuxoruk.  This will give those who missed the move another chance to get to the new server.  We'll open the log at noon on Friday and close it at noon on Monday, so you will have the weekend to execute the /movelog command.<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm
sure we've all done it once or twice (or more). You start looking through your
bags to see where that item that you've been carrying around for a month is
hiding so that you can finally sell it. But instead of closing your tailoring
kit, you combine it. Suddenly you've lost some stuff that you really wanted to
keep.<br>
Well, since EverQuest opened we've been warning you that this was one of the
risks that you took when using lightweight trade containers for their carrying
capacity rather than just using them for making things.<br>
<br>
We've decided to make a rather dramatic change for the better when it comes to
trade containers.<br>
<br>
With this upcoming patch, trade containers will no longer combine items that are
not a valid and complete recipe.<br>
<br>
This means that if you accidentally hit combine, the container will not destroy
your items. This also means that if you make an error and put the wrong item in
the container while trying to cook something up, it won't destroy those items
either. This will be a huge boon to craftspeople all across Norrath.<br>
<br>
But this removes the only drawback to using trade containers as backpacks. Their
reduced weight and often larger carrying capacity made them more desirable as
bags, with the risk that you might just lose something if you made a mistake.<br>
<br>
So, with the logical change in the way combinable containers work (I mean,
really, how often does a sewing kit eat a halberd?), we are also going to make
them less desirable for just carrying stuff around in. We will be increasing
their weight rather significantly. Where many of these containers weighed under
1 pound, they will now weigh as much as 4 pounds for the largest sewing kit.<br>
<br>
Along with this we are making a change to tailor made backpacks. In case you
didn't know (and I sure didn't), most tailor made packs have a built in weight
reduction of 5%. We are raising that to 10%. We will also be displaying the
weight reduction of all containers with the information shown on a right click.
It seems that so few people knew about the weight reduction of tailor made
items, even at Verant, that it seems that this bit of information should be
shown to the players.<br>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, we did make some DX initialization
code changes that should enable us in the future to take advantage of newer 3D
cards and their feature sets.<br>
<br>
There are a few problems associated with this code that are affecting some
players. Addressing these issues and getting a new client up is a priority and
we appreciate everyone's patience in the matter.<br>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Please note, these features only
work with D3D, so don't try them if you are using Glide.<br>
<br>
32 Bit Color Rendering</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If your video card supports 32 Bit
color 3D rendering then you can turn this on. Currently, the way to turn this on
is via editing your eqclient.ini file. Look for the line that reads
VideoModeBitsPerPixel=16 and change the 16 to a 32. Not only does this use 32
bit color rendering, but it utilizes 24 or 32 bit Z-Buffering (depending on your
card) which improves the visual quality of many zones. Cards that I know will
work are ones based on the nVidia TNT or Geforce chipsets, ATI Rage 128 and
Radeon cards, and 3Dfx Voodoo 4 or 5 cards. There are others, you can check your
video card manual or box to see if it lists 32bit color rendering as a feature.
Cards that we know do not support 32bit color rendering are the Voodoo 1, 2, or
3, and nVidia Riva 128 based cards (like the STB Velocity 128 and others).<br>
<br>
DirectX Texture Compression</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This feature will work with any
system or card. When enabled it will compress the textures at load time greatly
reducing the memory needed to run without swapping to the hard disk. However, it
will increase your load time, primarily between server select and character
select. If you have a system with more then 128 MB of ram then you probably
don't need to turn this on and suffer the longer load times. However, if you are
running with 64 MB or less then this could help with your in game performance at
the cost of a little extra load time. You turn this one on by editing your
eqclient.ini and changing the line that reads UseD3DTextureCompression=FALSE to
be TRUE instead. Also, note your video card does NOT need to support DXTC for
this feature to work, however if it does you will gain a little more performance
from it.</font></p>

<br>
Before a recent patch, you used to be able to /corpse bodies up through the trap
to where you zone in to Howling Stones. Last night, we had my group had a wipe
out and tried to do our usual drag to zone and found out the hard way that we
could no longer /corpse bodies up to be res'd.<br>
<br>
Was a limit put on z-axys /corpse? Was this a bug in the past that was recently
fixed?]</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>

</font>It looks like this was a bug. There seems to be a problem with /corpse
and its ability to pull a corpse up (or down) the z-axis. We should have it
fixed in the patch this week.<br>
<br>
Thanks for pointing this out. But I want to urge you to send bug reports in
using the form on the Quality Assurance board rather than this one. Your message
had to pass through an extra step (I had to send it to Ester) when you sent it
here.<br>
