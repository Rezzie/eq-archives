<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All high level characters should
do this quest to obtain the key to Charsis.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">Durgaz</font>, a froglok in the
<font color="#FFFFFF"> Swamp of No Hope</font>, has a
deal for you.
He holds in his hand the key to Charsis. All it takes for him to turn the key
over to you are a <font color="#FFFFFF"> Jade Chokdai Prod</font> and a <font color="#FFFFFF"> Vampire
Fang</font>.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Prod can be found on <font color="#FFFFFF"> Chancellor
Di'nok</font>. The fang is found on
a vampire inside <font color="#FFFFFF">Kaesora</font>.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When you give both items to Durgaz he will hand you the key
to Charsis.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First kill Chancellor <font color="#FFFFFF"> Di'Nok</font> to
obtain the <font color="#FFFFFF">Jade Chokdai Prod</font>.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Second kill the vampire in Kaesora
to obtain the fang.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Last of all give both items to Durgaz to receive the
key to Charsis.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"> You say, 'hail Dugroz'</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dugroz says 'Fffrroaaak!!  Go away!  I don't want to [work for them] anymore!  Go find another slave!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"> You say, 'What work for them'</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dugroz looks relieved and eyes you, considering. Finally,  he begins to recant his tale.  'I was once the slave of an important Iksar necromancer.  I was his Dugroz, his head slave.  One night, I heard two other slaves talking about me. I could barely hear them but what I did hear frightened me.  My master was going to use me one last time.  He was going to sacrifice me to craft a spell component for one of his most powerful spells.  Hearing this, I used my privileges as his head slave and made my [escape].'</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"> You say, 'How did you escape ?'</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dugroz says 'As the head slave, I was allowed to move freely throughout my master's compound.  I came across one of the slavemasters asleep in his chair and carefully relieved him of his [keys].  Then, quietly, I made my escape.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You say, 'What keys ?'</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dugroz says 'After I escaped, I lost myself in the depths of the swamp.  I discarded all the keys but one.  I will gladly give it to you if you can do me a [small favor].&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana"> You say, 'What small favor ?'</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dugroz blinks his eyes and leans forward. He whispers so quietly you must strain to hear him,  'I have taken up the same magics as my master.  I require two components to complete a spell I have been researching for quite some time.  The first is a vampire's fang.  I have heard tales of a vampire who haunts the ruins of Kaesora.  I also need a jade weapon stained by the blood of a chokidai.  Look in the Lake of Ill Omen at the sarnak outpost. The leader used to herd chokidai, or so I am told.'</font></p>
