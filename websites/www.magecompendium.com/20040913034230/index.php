<td width="100%"><font size="2">Headlines&#33;<br>_____________________<br><br>New PVP System goes live *<br>Raid Leaders can set up and change groups from the Raid Window *<br>Special Skies are back&#33;<br>New Hot Zones<br>EQ will now be more friendly in Windowed mode<br><br><br>All New PVP System for PVP Servers *<br>_____________________<br><br>The Watch List:<br>- Safe Zones: We’re still looking into a better solution for the problem of safe zones.  Expect some kind of change in the future.<br>- Point System: There are still concerns of potential exploits with the point system at this time.  Therefore the selection of PvP items available on the merchants will be limited to consumable items for now.  We’ll  monitor the accumulation of points after this update.  If all goes well, we will add a selection of equipment to the merchants in the near future.  <br>- Sullon Tokens: As a secondary concern with the point system, we  are delaying the addition of the turn-in quest for Sullon Zek tokens.  If there’s a potential problem with the point system that eventually requires us to make adjustments to the way points are awarded, we don’t want players to end up with less than full credit for these tokens.  Once the point system has had any potential issues ironed out we will add a quest to turn in your tokens for PvP points.<br><br>PvP Changes<br>- Melee attacks have a 50% increased range. This does not affect thrown weapons or archery.<br>- All safe zones have been removed save Shadowrest and the Bazaar. <br>- The maximum damage any one spell can do is now capped at 40% of the target’s total hit points, down from 75%. <br>- Archery damage has been increased to 80% of its base damage in PvP, up from 66%. <br>- Being stunned while on a horse will now cause the horse to disappear.  This only applies to stuns caused by other players. <br>- Lowered player melee mitigation, effectively lowering Armor Class by 20%.  This will increase the damage potential of melee weapons in PvP.  Originally the targets full armor class was considered. <br>- Player spells now have a separate duration field for PvP.  Individual spells will continue to be tuned during beta. <br>- Player spells now have a PvP specific resist mod.  Spell lines with resist mods differing from their normal adjusts initially include: <br>	Movement Rate <br>	Root <br>	Enthrall <br>	Mana Drain<br>	Stuns<br>	Direct Damage<br>	Damage over Time<br>	Pet procs/innates<br>- Added higher level snare spells for rangers/druids with increased resists mods.  This should allow them to land snare spells with similar frequency to other snare spells.  These spells are available on the PvP merchants for 1 point each.<br>- Necro and Mage pets have had their PvP resists increased to closer match the existing Beastlord pet resists.<br>- Lowered the duration of most snare, Enthrall, and Root spells and abilities.<br>- Berserker snare is no longer unresistable.<br>- Added a set of pumice stones to the PvP merchants that will cast various forms of dispel magic with a 1.5 second cast, 12 second cast time.<br>- Arena deaths will now place you at your bind point, and not in shadowrest.<br>- PvP Resurrection effects now last 5 minutes + 1 minute/negative vitality point.  The Max duration is now 15 minutes instead of 25.<br>- Made further changes to prevent hill ghosting.  Please test this and give feedback.<br>- Ranged weapons are no longer restricted by the Z axis, allowing greater freedom of use on varied terrain. <br>- Snare will now properly slow mounts.  The mount will still be faster then normal running while snared, but will considerably decrease their movement rate. <br>- Spells now have a minimum chance of landing of 5%, up from 2%. <br>- Water will no longer cause you to be immune to people outside of water and vice versa. <br>- Zoning with low health will no longer set your hit points equal to the amount of +HP gear you are wearing. <br>- Players killed in PvP combat will now spawn in Shadowrest with full equipment.  A naked corpse will remain in the location they died for 3 hours.   Note that this effectively removes item loot from Rallos Zek.  With the addition of no drop augments it became rather trivial to effectively remove item loot from the server anyway, and we felt the benefits of the new death system outweigh the benefits of an item loot system.<br>- Players who are killed in PvP combat will respawn with special resurrection effects on them.  The duration of these effects is variable dependant on how frequently they die. <br>- Summon Corpse Potions are now usable by any class/race. <br>- A system to score PvP kills has been implemented.  For more information see below.<br>Scoring System<br>The new scoring system will award points to any player who kills another player. If the player is grouped the points will be split between the players in the group. The points awarded will be based on three things:<br>1. Level of the killer<br> 2. Scoring Modifier<br>           a. Level Difference<br>           b. Infamy Difference<br>           c. Vitality score<br> 3. Time since the victim was last killed by the same player.<br> 1.  Level of the killer<br>            Each kill has a base point cost determined by the level of the killer.  All subsequent modifiers apply to this base number.<br> 2. Scoring modifier<br>            The scoring modifier is based on three things.  Each of these factors results in a score that is then applied in whole to the point value of the kill.<br> a. Level Difference<br>            For each level the killer is above or below the victim, the scoring modifier increase by one point.  If you kill some one who is higher level than you, you’ll gain more points then you will for a lower level character.  You will also subtract points from your modifier for killing a player lower level than you.<br>            Higher level characters are more powerful, and should be worth more points.  A victim must be at least level 20 to awards points.<br> b. Infamy Difference<br>            Each time you kill another player, points are added to your infamy pool.  At certain thresholds a player will gain an infamy level.  When a player is killed, the infamy levels are compared and the killer gains a scoring modifier point for each infamy level his victim is above him.  He can also lose scoring modifier points for killing someone who is of lower infamy.  Infamy will gradually deteriorate while the player is online.<br>            Players who regularly PvP are generally of higher skill level then those that do not.  This encourages players to kill other players who are of more equivalent skill.<br>c. Vitality<br>            When a player is killed their vitality is set to –10.  For each 5 minutes they are alive, they will gain back two points of vitality.  This vitality total is added directly to the scoring modifier.<br>            A player who dies very frequently is worth less points then one who stays alive longer.<br> d. Group bonus<br>Groups of 4 or more will receive a bonus % of points for each kill.  4/10%, 5/15%, 6/20%.<br> Example:<br>            Frizznik kills Rytan.  Frizznik is level 60, while Rytan is level 62 for a level difference of 2.  Frizznik has an infamy level of 5, while Rytan has an infamy level of 2, which results in infamy difference of –3.  Rytan has not recently been killed, so his vitality is 0.  Level Difference + Infamy Difference + Vitality = Scoring Point Modifier or 2 + (-3) + 0.<br>            Each scoring modifier point adds or subtracts 5% to the base score.  Normally Frizznik would gain 100 points for killing Rytan, but because of the scoring point modifier he will gain 95 points instead.<br> 3. Time since the killer has killed the same victim<br>             Players that repeatedly kill the same player will see a steep decrease in the amount of points a player is worth.  They will gain half the points for the kill they normally would for each time they kill that player in a 24 hour period.  After the score has dropped below 1 point, they will begin to lose points for killing the same player.<br> Leader Board<br>            The leader board tracks the players with the most total PvP.  A number of other useful statistics will be available in the leader board.<br> Point Rewards<br>            Players will be able to redeem their points for equipment via a Lost Dungeons of Norrath style adventure merchant interface.  These rewards will span from level 20 on up to 65 and include some pieces that are of elemental quality and possibly beyond.<br>            A player’s point total is capped based on their level.  They cannot gain more points once they hit that cap, although they can gain more infamy.  There will be a number of consumable PvP items that will be focused on PvP combat, and will only function against other players.<br><br>Windowed Mode *<br>_____________________<br>The EverQuest process is now more friendly. Alt+tab&#39;ing to other windows should be much more responsive.You can also choose to adjust your maximum Frames Per Second(FPS) in the Options Window under display settings. The valid range for the slider is 10 to 100.  The default is 100 which means EverQuest will not throttle your FPS. Lowering your setting will cap your FPS at that value and free up the CPU for other tasks.  <br><br>Raid Window Additions<br>_____________________<br>- The raid window contains a new row of buttons which the raid leader can use to organize the raid members into groups.<br>- Lock/Unlock:  The raid must be locked before the raid leader may use any of the new buttons.<br>- RemLeader:  Removes the &#39;Group Leader&#39; flag from the selected player from the &#39;Players Not in a Group&#39; list.  (Only 12 players may be Group Leaders, so this may be necessary to allow creation of a new group with a new leader).<br>- NoGroup:  Removes the selected player from their current group and put them into the &#39;Players Not in a Group&#39; list.<br>- 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12:  Moves the selected player into the numbered group.<br><br><br>Hot Zones have changed&#33; *<br>_____________________<br><br>Hunt for greater XP rewards in the new Hot Spots.  Make your way to the following zones.<br><br>60-65 Plane of Torment <br>55-60 Chardok <br>50-55 Grieg&#39;s End <br>45-50 Nurga <br>40-45 City of Mist <br>35-40 Kaesora <br>30-35 Dalnir <br>25-30 Hollowshade Moor <br>20-25 Runnyeye <br><br>Kill a few goblins for me.  Oh, and that Grieg guy.<br><br>AA Changes<br>_____________________<br>- The cleric AA Touch of the Divine has had its healing power increased.  The original ability has been refunded, so players who wish to retain the ability will need to purchase it again. The portion of the AA that will remove detrimental effects, when it goes off, will not be going in with this update.<br>- The necromancer AA Swarm of Decay has been refunded.<br>- The shaman AA Call of the Ancients has had its description changed to reflect the fact that the summoned ward casts healing spells, not endurance regen spells.  The ability has been refunded because of this confusion.<br>- The rogue ability Seized Opportunity has had its chance to work significantly increased.<br>- The druid ability Viscid Roots was increasing the chance for roots to break, not decreasing it.  This has been corrected.<br>- The paladin ability Hastened Piety now affects the reuse time for both Hand of Piety and its upgrade, Pious Supplication.  Previously, it wasn’t affecting Pious Supplication.<br>- When an AA is an upgrade of another AA and both are triggered abilities, players can make a hotkey and use either one, but will only get the upgraded effect if they use the hotkey for the upgraded ability. <br>- The Mass Group Buff AA will now reset if you duck to cancel the spell.<br>- The double attack AA now works with secondary hand attacks.<br><br>Consent Changes *<br>_____________________<br><br>There are some new consent commands available for groups and raids. <br><br>- /consent group -- flags your current corpses so they can be dragged by all of your current group members<br>- /consent raid -- flags your current corpses so they can be dragged by anyone in your raid (including people who join the raid later)<br>- /consent guild -- flags your current corpses so they can be dragged by anyone in your guild<br>- /deny group -- removes the flag<br>- /deny raid -- removes the flag<br>- /deny guild -- removes the flag<br><br><br>Tacvi Changes<br>_____________________<br>- Tacvi will no longer give lockout timers.  Instead, when you beat an encounter there, you will gain a timer for that specific event.  Then, when you come back to the zone, if that timer hasn’t expired yet that particular event won’t be up, but other events in the zone will be if it has been long enough since the last time they were defeated.<br>- Loot in Tacvi has been given a thorough audit.  Many changes were made including changes to the statistics of the items, changing item names, changing where the items drop, and over a dozen new items were added to the zone. <br>- The Tacvi zone timer was increased from 6 hours to 12 hours.  <br><br>Misc.<br>_____________________<br>- Diamond Dust will now drop more frequently in permafrost and can now also be found in SolusekB *<br>- Names will now scale with character they’re associated with.  So a giant will have a much larger name than a Halfling will while retaining its much smaller brain.<br>- Names for larger characters will be visible from a greater distance than the names for smaller characters are.  They will also scale up slightly as you increase your distance from a character, making them more readable from a greater distance.<br>- Tinting should now work properly again on Robes, let the Fluorescent Pink tinting begin&#33;<br>- We have added Tooltips for your status bars.*<br>- We have made some changes to the fonts EQ uses so that they are more clear and visible.<br>- Pets will no longer attacks NPCs after their owner has COH&#39;d<br>- The Fiery Defenders particles should no longer blink<br>- If your Minor Illusion fails, you will be able to use another illusion on yourself without zoning.<br>- Instant cast combat abilities can once again be used when you have a discipline up.<br>- Augments now fit into multiple slot types.  <br>- Zoning pets will now save their taunt toggle settings.<br>- Spell damage done to yourself will no longer display to others.<br>- Pets will no longer poof when you are Call of Hero&#39;d.<br>- Weapon Augments will now proc properly.<br><br>*denotes a community requested change</font><br><br></td>

The original key quest has not been modified. However, the new entry quest uses the old key and offers an alternate quest to do instead of the original key quest. <br><br>- Items in the zone are now of elemental planes quality.<br><br>- Faction now matters: Dragons in Veeshan’s Peak will now speak to players if you have the correct faction and can understand them.<br><br>- New quests and lore: The dragons in Veeshan’s Peak will now give players the option to acquire items through questing for them.<br><br>- The zone is now an exp zone as well: Hunting in the areas before the dragons yields experience and loot.<br><br><br>New Adventure Zone for Stormhammer <br>-------------------<br><br>Stormhammer gains a new adventure zone.

Search the Desert of Ro for the whereabouts of Bartleby and his assistant Bomo and try to save them from the steel clutches of their enemies.<br><br><br>Augment Removal *<br>-------------------<br><br>- You can now purchase special "distillers" that will remove augmentations without destroying them. These distillers are sold by a merchant in Butcherblock. The item inspect window for an augmentation will tell you which distiller is required to remove it.<br><br>- The existing solvents can still be used to destroy an augmentation if you don&#39;t want to keep it. You no longer need a different solvent for each augmentation slot. The interface will allow you to select which augmentation you wish to delete.<br><br>- For those with custom UI&#39;s, you will need to update your EQ_Container.xml file in order to use the new augment window.<br><br>Pets * <br>-------------------<br><br>- Zoning pets are in. Persistent pet data includes: Items, Spell Effects, hit points, mana, name, height, and mana cost to summon them. All PC summoned pets should zone with you in all instances except for when you die.

Please wash them in only Cold water to prevent inadvertently reducing their size.<br><br><br>Tribute Changes * <br>-------------------<br><br>- Some items have had their favor value lowered.<br><br>- Players will now "Pre-pay" for tribute benefits. When benefits are activated, the player will immediately be charged for those benefits from their Favor pool. After that, the player will be charged every 10 minutes for the next 10 minutes of benefit. If benefits are deactivated before the timer is depleted, no refund is given for the time remaining.<br><br>- Players now have the ability to activate/deactivate the tribute benefits they&#39;ve selected (as a whole) whenever they like using a button on the Tribute Benefit Window. However, every time the player activates his benefits, he will be "Pre-pay" (see above). The ability to change selected benefits (downgrade) away from the Tribute Master has been removed.<br><br>- When visiting a Tribute Master, the player&#39;s benefits will deactivate. Players may re-organize their selected benefit load, but will not be able to "preview" the benefits (seeing the effect on their character when the benefit is selected).

<td width="100%"><font size="2">On June 11, 2004, questions from the Magician community were sent to SOE President John Smedley, and Everquest Community Relations Manager Alan Crosby (aka Brenlo).<br><br><br><P>John Smedley, Alan Crosby, and the entire EverQuest development team,<br><br><P>On behalf of the Magician community, I thank you for this opportunity for<br>reading this feedback and for answering our questions.<br><br><P>With the Omens of War expansion coming up so soon after the (poorly<br>implemented) Gates of Discord expansion, the entire EverQuest community has<br>place extreme criticism over Sony Online Entertainment. I needn&#39;t go into<br>the flaws with Gates of Discord; however, SOE, until recently, seemed poised<br>to repeat the mistakes of the last five major expansions:<br><br><P>-Creating class imbalance due to level increases, mob difficulty increases,<br>and poor creativity and implementation in class abilities and spells.<BR><br>-Alienating the common player, and catering to the high end player base (aka<br>uber-guilds).<BR><br>-Providing little or no benefit to low and mid level players, and providing<br>heavy emphasis on the high level player base.<BR><br>-Straying away from the fantasy roleplay aspects of the game, and instead<br>concentrate on "alien" themes.<BR><br>-Making the game less "fun" by removing, among other things, the "Quest" in<br>"EverQuest."<br><br><P>The Magician community addresses the representatives of the EverQuest<br>development team and seeks to find out more about the new expansion to<br>determine its value.<br><br><P>However, before we can understand Omens of War, we must understand the<br>Magician class further. We MUST know the CURRENT state of the Magician<br>class. Therefore, I present these specific questions.<br><br><P>-What is Sony Online Entertainment&#39;s definition of the Magician class? What<br>is our role?<BR><br>-What is our relative rank among "DPS" classes? Among other spell caster<br>classes?<BR><br>-Are we, or are we not, the premier pet class? If so, why are we less<br>capable of supporting our pets as other classes? Why are Dire Charm pets<br>perceived as outdamaging our pets?<BR><br>-Are we, or are we not, a soloing class? If we are, why is soloing from<br>level 61 beyond far less viable than it was from levels 1 to 60? Why do many<br>classes (especially classes able to Kite and Quad-Kite) have a superior solo<br>advantage?<BR><br>-At this point in the game, why are we the only caster that has no way to<br>survive a hostile environment except Gate?<BR><br>-Why are Magician pet heals so lacking?<br><br><P>The members of the Magician community also want to know answers to the<br>following class balance issues.<br><br>-Why are druids overall a better nuke class than Magicians? [Note: As of<br>June 9th, Test server was patched to bridge the gaps between Magician and<br>Druid post-level-63 nukes. However, Druids still retain their nuking<br>advantage from levels 1 to 62, and 63+ with Quick Damage]<BR><br>-Is our pet expected to cover the full range of abilities (Root, Snare, etc)<br>that other classes have?<BR><br>-Where are the pet-specific focus items? (Aeromancy, Aquamancy, Geomancy,<br>Pyromancy)<BR><br>-Why has it taken so long to resolve the issues with the 51+ fire pets?<BR><br>-When will Magicians receive a form of defense that is actually usable by a<br>level 50 mage with zero AA?<BR><br>-Why was the summoned population of Plane of Fire apparently nerfed, while<br>Planes of Earth and Air were left untouched?<BR><br>-Will pets ever return to high (invulnerable or near) resists to specific<br>element AoEs?<br><br><P>There are several things known about the new expansion. However, the<br>Magician community seeks more specific answers to the following questions.<br><br><P>The number one question on EVERY EverQuest player&#39;s mind is:<br><br><P>-What kind of Quality Assurances will be in place to ensure the "Cluster"<br>(as elequantly put at the Guild Summit) does not happen again in Omens of<br>War, and future expansions?<br><br><P>Furthermore, the following questions about Omens of War are asked by the<br>Magician Community:<br><br><P>-What is the expected level range for Omens of War zones?<BR><br>-Related to the above question, will the Gates expansion be required to gain<br>access to Omens zones?<BR><br>-Will the Epic 2.0 be accessible to Non-Time-equipped players?<BR><br>-Will the Epic 2.0 quests be mostly 1 groupable, or will raids be required<br>for most parts of the epic?<BR><br>-Will summoned creatures be put into the new (and retroduced into existing)<br>zones so we have a reason to use our anti-summoned spells?<BR><br>-Related to the question above, will there be a continuation of the poorly<br>implemented summoned-charm and summoned-mesmerization spell lines?<BR><br>-Will a large number of Omens zones be seeded with direcharm-able (normal,<br>animal, and undead) creatures? If so, how many will also be seeded with<br>level 60 summoned and charmable creatures?<BR><br>-Will there be any new spell lines for Magicians? In general?<BR><br>-Will existing IV focus items and focus items from the Elemental Planes and<br>beyond be usable from level 66 and up?<BR><br>-Will Magicians be receiving any kind of aggro reducing abilities or spells?<BR><br>-Will spells in Omens be common, similar to Kunark, Luclin, and Planes of<br>Power, or will they be rare and hard to obtain, leaving only the elite few<br>to collect them?<BR><br>-Related to the above question, will spell scrolls be NO DROP?<BR><br>-Will there be new content for low to mid level players?<BR><br>-Will the new Task System be implemented for ALL levels of characters?<BR><br>-Will magicians get the needed resist modifiers to our damage spells that<br>all other dps casters (dru/wiz/nec) get? (Even bards were given a -50 resist<br>modifier in their attack spells recently)<BR><br>-Are there plans for an upgraded Mod Rod in Omens?<br><br><P>Finally, the community wants to know about the state of Everquest&#39;s future.<br><br><P>-When will Everquest return to being a fantasy role-playing game, rather<br>than the space/alien themes of Shadows of Luclin, Gates of Discord, and<br>apparently Omens of War?<BR><br>-When will Roleplaying become a significant part of game play again?<BR><br>-When will we hear feedback about our class balance posts that are on the<br>official SOE boards?<BR><br>-Will there be new models for pets in Omens of War and the new graphics<br>engine? Will they be humanoid to allow riding on mounts while under an<br>elemental illusion?<BR><br>-Will there be a second Summit for those classes not represented as well, if<br>at all, at the first Summit?<BR><br>-What is being done to ensure the longevity and survivability of EverQuest<br>in the current MMORPG market?<br><br><P>Please respond to these questions in a prompt and timely manner. Sony Online<br>Entertainment and EverQuest are poised to recaptre and retain the title of<br>best MMORPG game and company.
