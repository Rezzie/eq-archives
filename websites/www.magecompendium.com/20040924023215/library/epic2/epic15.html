<H1>The Magician Epic Quest 1.5</H1>

<P>This is a work in progress, and is definitely <B>NOT</B> complete. Please help out and fill in gaps where needed. If you have a missing image, <a href=mailto:xalmat@magecompendium.com>Email it to me</a>. Just an FYI, this guide is printer friendly (Text will appear black when you print), but is a rather large amount of pages. Certain images and phrases will not print; this is intentional.</P>

<P>A couple disclaimers about this quest. You won't be able to skip around hail sequences; you must do them in order. Very little of the quest can be skipped around; Unless the mob or item is always up and does not involve a series of hails to trigger, you will not be able to get the item. Nothing can be MultiQuested, which was a common practice in most other quests. With that said, good luck!</P>

<P>This quest is intended to be completed by people with Elemental-quality gear. Group requirements are targeted for that range. If you have lower-level gear than Elemental, you will need more; likewise if you gear is far superior to Elemental, you can get by with less.

<a name=0></a><H2>Step 0: Quest Introduction</H2>
<P><B>Requirements: Two or Three groups</B></P>

<P>There are two parts to this new quest. The first part is for newcomers to the quest who have not completed the <b class=item>Orb of Mastery</B> epic quest. If you have completed the <B class=item>Orb of Mastery</B> quest, you will skip to the next step automatically, and will not have to do this part.

<P>Your first step is to meet with <B class=npc>Bantil Io`Tuv</B> in the <B class=zone>Plane of Knowledge</B> library. He is located at (121.12, 992.91, 97.75)

<B class=you>You say, 'Another way?'</B><BR><BR>
Bantil Io`Tuv says 'Well, there are 4 Elementals that have gone rogue. They escaped from their elemental planes, and I fear they may be planning some mischief. They have assumed new names, so look for a Wildfire Elemental, an Earthquake Elemental, a Tsunami Elemental, and a Monsoon Elemental. Hand them this vial when you find them, it will allow you to fight them, and also capture them once they are beaten. Return them to me so they can be handled correctly.</p>

<a name=1></a><H2>Step 1: Meet with Bantil Io`Tuv</h2>
<P><B>Requirements: Solo</B>

<P>When you complete the introduction quest, or you already possess the <B class=item>Orb of Mastery</B>, you can now truly begin the quest. The following text is if you have the <B class=item>Orb of Mastery</B>. If you do not have the Orb, the text will appear slightly different.</P>

<P>Meet with <B class=npc>Bantil Io`Tuv</B> in the <b class=zone>Plane of Knowledge</b> library. He is located at (121.12, 992.91, 97.75) 

<table><tr><td><img src=images/bantil_iotuv.jpg align=left class=hide><P class=quote><B class=you>You say, 'Hail, Bantil Io`Tuv' </B><BR><BR>

Bantil Io`Tuv says 'Greetings. I see you have followed the path of Magi'Kot, quite some time ago he was my teacher. I was sad to hear of his fate. He was a great man, he understood the elements in a manner that few have before him. I was glad to hear that his legacy lived past his demise, and I am happy to meet someone that has followed in his [footsteps].' <BR><BR>

<B class=you>You say, 'I followed his footsteps' </B><BR><BR>

Bantil Io`Tuv says 'Magi'Kot strove to push the limits of knowledge, however few know that he was more of a researcher than an innovator. His strongest attribute was the ability to gather knowledge and derive patterns and trends from the teachings of summoners before him. Since his untimely death, I have learned the [source of his research] on elemental mastery.' <BR><BR>

<B class=you>You say, 'What is the source of his research' </B><BR><BR>

Bantil Io`Tuv says 'There have been elemental masters for as long as there has been magic. There are many great magicians whose names have been lost to history. I recently learned that Magi'Kot gained access to some of these ancient teachings. This is how he learned the path to elemental mastery. His other disciples and myself thought this knowledge was gone forever, until we learned that the original tomes were stored here, in the [Great Library].' <BR><BR>

<B class=you>You say, 'Where in the Great Library?' </B><BR><BR>

Bantil Io`Tuv says 'There is little that has ever been written that has not, or will not, sit on the shelves here. Sadly, when I finally managed to make it here, the tomes were missing. No one seemed to know where they have gone or why. I have been searching for clues telling of where these tomes vanished to, and finally, the [pieces] are starting to come together.' <BR><BR>

<B class=you>You say, 'What pieces' </B><BR><BR>

Bantil Io`Tuv says 'I am hesitant to use the word conspiracy, however the more I find, the more that seems to be the best choice. I found this note while searching for the tomes. I suspect it may lead you to finding the first of the missing tomes, sadly I do not recognize the language.' </P>

<P>At this time, you will receive a <B class=item>Tattered Note</B>.</P>
<P><img src=images/tattered_note.jpg><BR>
<img src=images/tattered_note_text.jpg></P>

<P>This note is written in Akhevan, a language that players cannot learn as a skill. However, based on other information in the game, it can be loosely translated to:</P>

<P class=quote>The enemy will be <font style="color: red">&lt;the page is ripped and unreadable&gt;</font> blasphemy. The shadows guard me</P></table>

<HR>

<a name=2></a><h2>Step 2: Meet with Danvi</h2>
<P><B>Requirements: One Group</B></P>

<P>It would seem <B class=npc>Danvi</B> is someone of importance. Since the note is in Akhevan, it would seem reasonable Danvi is in <b class=zone>Akheva Ruins</B>. You will most likely need a full group to make it to <B class=npc>Danvi</B>, but it can be done (although very risky) solo if you have enough HP.</P>

<P class=hide><B class=npc>Danvi</B> is located at the location on this map...</P>

<P align=center class=hide><img src=images/akheva_map.jpg><BR>
<img src=images/danvi_corpse.jpg></P>

<P><span class=hide>...or rather her corpse is.</span> It would seem the enemy got to her first. In any case, target her corpse and use the command /open.* Then you are free to loot her book, the <B class=item>Journal of Magus Tvish</B>. <b class=mob>Danvi's Corpse</B> respawns once every 1 hour and 55 minutes. Take this book back to <B class=npc>Bantil</B> in <B class=zone>Plane of Knowledge.</B></P>

<P><B>*IMPORTANT NOTE*</B> <I>If you have aggro with <U>anything</U> in the zone, you will not be able to use the /open command. If you have aggroed anything, try to /camp out to clear it.</I></P>

<P align=center><img src=images/journal_tvish.jpg></P>

<P class=quote>Bantil Io`Tuv focuses for a minute, his hands glow with power. He then blows softly and the shadows melt from the Tome. As he opens it a small note falls to the floor. What is this? it appears to be some sort of correspondence. Hmm, interesting, it seems the next tome was given to a gnome, he set sail somewhere, but has not been heard from in quite some time. You will have to find him, he was supposed to wait for [Danvi] so he could take the tome. <BR><BR>

<B class=you>You say, 'Who is Danvi?' </B><BR><BR>

Bantil Io`Tuv says, 'Danvi is supposed to identify herself with the password "Violet Roses", when you find this gnome tell him the pass phrase and he should give you the book.' </P>

<HR>

<a name=3></a><h2>Step 3: Meet with the Lost Tome Keeper</h2>
<P><B>Requirements: Solo</B></P>

<P>Travel to the <B class=zone>Western Wastes</B> on Velious. At the far north end of the zone along the coast line is a crashed gnome ship. On it is <b class=npc>a Lost Tome Keeper</B>, location p4481 p1860 n303. Identify yourself with the password Violet Roses.</P>

<table><tr><td><img src=images/lost_tomekeeper.jpg align=left class=hide>

<P class=quote><B class=you>You say, 'I am Violet Roses' </B><BR><BR>

a Lost Tomekeeper says, 'Oh? Yes. The tunips blow clockwise, or something or other. Here you go. Stay diligent. The enemy may be anyone.' </P>

<P>You receive the <b class=item>Tome of Primal Fires</B>. Multiple mages can receive this book at the same time. Return it to <b class=npc>Bantil</B> in <b class=zone>Plane of Knowledge</B>.</P>

<P><img src=images/tome_of_primal_fires.jpg></P>

<P class=quote>Bantil lo`Tuv quickly thumbs through the book. You can see the excitement growing on his face. 'This is incredible. I can see why Magi'Kot was able to learn so much from these tomes. There are just three more that we need to find, and we will be able to [ascend beyond] Magi'Kot's greatest dreams.' <BR><BR>

<B class=you>You say, 'Ascend beyond?' </B><BR><BR>

Bantil lo`Tuv says, 'Oh my! Where has my mind been? I haven't even told you what these tomes are capable of. As you can see, I have mastered the orb as well. I have long suspected that this is not the pinnacle of elemental power, these [two books] prove it beyond any doubt. With the power present in the orb, the teachings I learned from Magi'Kot, and the knowledge from the tomes, I suspect we should be able to figure out how to reach the next level. Magi'Kot would be so proud!' <BR><BR>

<B class=you>You say, 'What two books?' </B><BR><BR>

Bantil lo`Tuv says, 'Oh! I am sorry, I get so excited sometimes. Yes, the next two books. I've found some information alluding to their whereabouts. The first was hidden in another great library, somewhere across the "Frightened Abyss". Whatever that means. The second is in the protection of someone studying the mental effects of horror.' </P></table>

<HR>

<a name=4></a><H2>Step 4: Find the Lost Tomes</h2>
<P><B>Requirements: One or Two groups</B></P>

<P>There are two hints for finding the two lost tomes. The first is the "Frightened Abyss". As it happens, Frightened Abyss is a synonym for the <B class=zone>Timorous Deep</B>. And the closest library across the <B class=zone>Timorous Deep</B> is the grand library of <b class=zone>Charasis</B>. And thats exactly where you have to go.</P>

<P>The tome you are looking for, the <b class=item>Book of Bindings and Incantations</B>, is located in the east hallway of <b class=zone>Charasis</B>. In order to enter the zone, you will need to complete the <b class=item>Key of Charasis</B> quest. Once inside, you will need to either find a way across the fake stairway to the east, or clear the zone and acquire the keys that lead you to the east side of the zone. Either way, you will find the tome sitting right on top of a table in the east hallway. You will need a group to acquire this, unless you are very daring and are able to pull this off solo. The <b class=item>Book of Bindings and Incantations</B> respawns once every two hours.</P>

<P align=center><img src=images/hsmap.jpg><BR>
<img src=images/bookstand.jpg class=hide><BR>
<img src=images/book_of_bindings.jpg></P>

<P>The next tome is a bit more difficult, as it requires you travel to the depths of <b class=zone>The Deep</B> to the <b class=mob>Thought Horror Overfiend</B>. You do not have to kill the THO, but you do have to travel thru his room. As such, you will need a solid group or two to reach your destination. The <b class=mob>Elder Thought Horrors</B> are rather difficult; it's advised you have a powerful tank, enchanter or bard for crowd control, and a Cleric healing to deal with them. You will need to defeat the <b class=mob>Elder Thought Horrors</B> surrounding <b class=mob>Grigor Rohja</B> before you can engage him safely.</P>

<P align=center><img src=images/thedeep.jpg></P>

<table><tr><td><img src=images/grigor_rojha.jpg align=left class=hide><P><b class=mob>Grigor Rojha</B> is a difficult mob for the underequipped. You will need one to two groups to defeat him. He hits for around 1,000, and has two spells associated with him: <a href=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3018&source=Live>Nova Inferno</a>, and <a href=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3051&source=Live>Fiery Assault</a>, both of which are interruptible by air pets (if the stun lands). He is also invisible, so you will need See Invisibility to find him. <b class=mob>Grigor</B> respawns once every 2 hours. Defeat him and you will receive the <b class=item>Codex of Ice and Ether.</B></P>

<P align=center><img src=images/codex_of_ice_and_ether.jpg></P>

<P>Return these books back to <b class=npc>Bantil.</B> Upon returning one book, he says the following:</P>

<P class=quote>Bantil lo 'Tuv says 'Ahh great, thank you. There are some interesting notes in these books. I suspect soon we should be able to find who is responsible for the disappearance in the first place.</P>

<P>Once he has the second book, he will say the following:</P>

<P class=quote>Bantil Io`Tuv says 'Oh my. Oh this is most disturbing news. It appears that one of Magi'Kot's apprentices was responsible for the theft of these books. This may not be the end of the story. Magi'Kot had four apprentices. Jahson Aksot, Akksstaff, Walnan and myself. There are notes in some of these letters that no one but one of his apprentices could have known. Speak to the others please, but be discreet, I sense something much larger at work here, return to me with anything you find.'</P>

<P>At this point you need to track down <B class=npc>Jahsohn Aksot</B> in the <b class=zone>West Commonlands</B>, <b class=npc>Akksstaff</B> in <B class=zone>Najena</B>, and <b class=npc>Walnan</B> in <b class=zone>Butcherblock Mountains</B>. If you completed the <b class=npc>Orb of Mastery</B> quest, you already know where to find them.</P></table>

<HR>

<a name=5></a><H2>Step 5: Seek Magi`Kot's Apprentices</h2>
<P><B>Requirements: One or Two groups</B></P>

<P>There are three possible suspects. You need to seek them out.

<table><tr><td><img src=images/jahsohn_aksot.jpg align=left class=hide><P><b class=npc>Jahsohn Aksot</B> is found <b class=zone>West Commonlands</B> near the <b class=zone>Kithikor Forest</B> zone line. He is usually spawned.</P>

Jahsohn Aksot says 'Greetings, Soandso .<BR><BR>

<B class=you>You say, 'Bantil sent me.'</B><BR><BR>

Jahsohn Aksot says 'You are working with Bantil? I hope you had some luck finding the books. Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you. Bantil is a friend, despite his gnomish heritage.'</P></table>

<table><tr><td><img src=images/akksstaff.jpg align=left class=hide><P>Next is <B class=npc>Akksstaff</B>, located at (p367, n67) in <b class=zone>Najena</B>. He is usually spawned. (*Disclaimer: Do NOT do the following step after <b class=npc>Walnan</B> and <b class=npc>Jahsohn Aksot</B>!)</P>

<P class=quote><B class=you>You say, 'Hail, Akksstaff'</B><BR><BR>

Akksstaff says 'What do you want?! Foolish High Elf, I am in no mood to treat with beggars. I have half a mind to turn Jobober here loose on you! Well, don't keep me waiting, state your business or be off with you!<BR><BR>

<B class=you>You say, 'Bantil sent me.'</B><BR><BR>

Akksstaff says 'Bantil was always a good friend. I'm afraid I cant be of any help to you. Good luck to both of you.'</P></table>

<table><tr><td><img src=images/walnan.jpg align=left class=hide><P><b class=npc>Walnan</B> is in <b class=zone>Butcherblock Mountains</B> and can wander anywhere between <b class=zone>Kaladim</B> and the docks to the west. She is <I>NOT</I> always spawned.</P>

<P class=quote><B class=you>You say, 'Hail, Walnan'</B><BR><BR>

<B class=you>You say, 'Bantil sent me.'</B><BR><BR>

Walnan says 'How is good old Bantil doing? I'm afraid I don't have any information for you, but if I hear anything I'll be sure to tell you. Oh, you may want to speak to Akksstaff again, he and Bantil never quite saw eye to eye, you may want to ask him about Bantil again.'</P></table>

<P>It would seem that someone is hiding something. Go say hi to your buddy <b class=npc>Akksstaff</B> again. You <B>WILL</B> have needed to talk to <b class=npc>Walnan</B> and <b class=npc>Jahsohn Aksot</B> first. You will want to bring at least one or two groups, as well.</P>

<P class=quote><B class=you>You say, 'Bantil sent me.'</B><BR><BR>

Akksstaff says 'My, you are persistant aren't you? Well you have found more trouble than you expected, now haven't you? Prepare to witness the true power of a master of the elements!'</P>

<table><tr><td><img src=images/akksstaff_minion.jpg align=left class=hide><img class=hide src=images/akksstaff_host.jpg align=left><P>At this point <b class=mob>Akksstaff's Minion</B> spawns and attacks you!  <b class=mob>Akksstaff's Minion</B> hits for 1147, so you will need a strong tank and some strong healing.

<B class=you>You say,'What about the demise?' </B><BR><BR>

Akksstaff grins. 'I am the last Council Member of the Order of the Elemental Shadows. For Centuries, we protected the true secrets behind elemental mastery, but our sect dies here with me. I chose to sit at Magi'kot's side and watch his progress, he showed more promise than anyone since Tvish. When I learned he was to receive the Orb of Mastery, I sabotaged his spell. The flaw was not his, but now people have succeeded where he failed. It doesn't matter, even with the power of the Orb and the knowledge in these tomes, Bantil will never unlock the full power of elemental mastery. You are only helping him to meet the same fate as Magi'Kot.' He then hands you the book and fades into the shadows.</P>

<P>He hands you a book called <b class=item>Sentience of Elements</B>, and despawns. He will respond in about a half hour or so.</P>

<P class=quote>Bantil Io`Tuv says 'Akksstaff was responsible for our teacher's death? That is truly sad news. I knew he was devious, but I never suspected this type of betrayal.' Bantil takes a deep breath as he regains his composure, and he starts to browse through the book. 'This is truly amazing. I don't think Magi'Kot ever had access to this... No, of course he didn't. He never would have believed the Orb of Mastery was the pinnacle of [power] if that was the case.'<BR><BR>

<B class=you>You say, 'what power'</B><BR><BR>

Bantil Io`Tuv says 'It seems that the Master of Elements is both the key and the lock before the next level of understanding. He is an amalgam of four equally powerful elemental beings. The essence from these four elementals will serve as the catalyst for ascension beyond the power of the Orb. Sadly, the texts tell nothing of the location of these four creatures, but I suspect that the gatekeepers to the elemental planes may be able to help us locate them. If you can, please head to Tranquility and ask the guardians of the Elemental planes about the Elemental Essences.'</P>

<P>When you enter Noble's Causeway, there are several trip locations. Once you find this location, the following yellow text will appear, and a find path will appear for you to follow:</P>

<P class=quote>You hear the wind whistling around your head, and see a strange windswept trail appear before you.</P>

<P>Follow the path, and the <B class=mob>Elemental Essence of Air</B> will spawn. Be warned that once you hit the find path, <I>anyone</I> can trigger the fight. The fight reportedly goes like this (Thanks Celecar of Mithaniel Marr for the details): He starts off by attacking you, unknown hit damage. At about 80% he despawns, and two adds spawn that hit for 1400s and casts <a href=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3075&source=Live>Wind of Xegony</a>. Defeat them and the <B class=mob>Essence</B> respawns. At 50% he despawns and three adds replace him, same as before. At 20% same thing but with 4 adds again. Finally once all the adds are dead you are able to defeat the <B>Essence</B> himself.</P>

<P>The reward is the <B class=item>Elemental Essence of Air</B>, as well as a treasure chest that spawns near him containing valuable attunable loot. You can repeat this fight within a few hours.</P>

<B class=you>You say, 'what about the elemental essences' </B>

Jurmak the Undertow says 'Oh? The Elemental Essence of water? That is what you mean, yes? Consider yourself fortunate, I know the location of the Essence. It has spent quite some time living as a minor god to the othmir.' </P></table>

<P>It seems like a stretch, but the mild mannered Othmir of <b class=zone>Cobalt Scar</B> have a water god! Speak to their spiritual leader, the <b class=npc>High Priest Margle</B>. Unlike the other Othmir in the zone, he is not on Othmir faction; however the other Othmir will try to attack you if you are KOS.</P>

<B class=you>You say, 'water god?' </B><BR><BR>

High Priest Margle says 'Tiknonmanin is our one true god. He protects us when we need, and we give him tithing of fish and whatever else we find in the waters. I am the only one allowed to call him, but there are many who ask me to call him so they can give him their reverence. From time to time, someone comes to challenge him in combat. He is very confident in his power, especially this close to the water, so he allows anyone who wishes to [challenge] him.' <BR><BR>

<B class=you>You say, 'challenge' </B><BR><BR>

High Priest Margle says 'Well it has been some time. I guess I could allow a challenge, but you'll need to do something for me first. We've been having a tough time catching enough fish of late, and our bait supplies are running low. Bring us the meat from four ice burrowers. I'll call Tiknonmanin for you when you return.'</P></table>

<P>Head to <b class=zone>Western Wastes</B> and kill <b class=mob>Ice Burrowers</B>. Skilled mages can solo <b class=mob>Ice Burrowers</B> either by straight up pet tanking or by kiting. Beware the other mobs in the zone, especially if you are KOS to the Claws of Veeshan! Loot four <b class=item>Ice Burrower Meats</B>, and return them to <b class=npc>High Priest Margle</B> to spawn <b class=mob>Tiknonmanin</B>.

Miak the Searedsoul says 'Ahh the eternal search for knowledge, both bane and blessing to mortals. So, you seek the Elemental Essence of Fire? I have heard very little of it in many years, although, come to think of it, I have heard rumors of a powerful elemental trapped in the personal forge of Tagrin. I suspect that might be a good place to begin your search at the very least, but you'll need to find someone there willing to speak with you. Good luck seeker.' </P></table>

<P>Your journey in search of <b class=mob>Tagrin</B> takes you to <b class=zone>Plane of Tactics</B>, where you come across a halfling named <b class=npc>Gnapp Guinders</b>. He's reported to be found near location p2000, p1200, in Tagrin's room. You will need at least one group, possibly two. When you hail him he responds.</P>

<B class=you>You say, 'How has he upgraded?'</B><BR><BR>

Gnaap Guinders says 'Oh! Curious are you? Well I'm not going to tell you unless you get me out of here!  And don't think you can just break my chains with some heavy weapons or some fancy hocus-pocus! Its going to take more than that to [break Tagrin's steel].'<BR><BR>

Gnaap Guinders says 'If I knew that do you think I'd be here still?  I thought you'd at least be half as smart as you look!  Well, I have a friend that may be able to help us.  Have you ever met Bor Wharhammer? Well if you have, good, go to him.  If you haven't, find him.  Bring him a hammer made by Tagrin so he can see what he's working with.  He's really good at breaking stuff.  Bring him this note as well, so he knows I sent you.'</P>

<P align=center><img src=images/gnapp_note.jpg></P></table>

<P>He hands you a note. Before you can take it to <b class=npc>Bor Warhammer</B>, you will need to kill the Diaku in <b class=zone>Plane of Tactics</B> for a <b class=item>Diaku Forged Maul</B>. A skilled and well-equipped Mage can solo these, but it's significantly safer to bring a group. <span class=hide>When you see one with a maul equipped, it will look like this:</span></P>

<p align=center><img src=images/diaku_warrior.jpg class=hide><BR>

<P>Take the <b class=item>Diaku War Maul</B> and the <B class=item>Note from Gnaap</B> to <b class=npc>Bor Warhammer</B> in <b class=zone>Plane of Tranquility</B>.</P>

<p class=quote>Bor Wharhammer says 'Eh? I see ol' Gnaap 'as gotten' 'imself in'o a pickle again. Well le's see. I figu'e tha'ye need a good solven'.

<P>You get back a <b class=item>Reinforced Flask</B>.</P>

<P align=center><img src=images/reinforced_flask.jpg></P>

<P>You now have to find three items: <b class=item>Metallic Liquid</B>, <b class=item>Hydrolyzed Ether</B>, and <b class=item>Heavy Water</B>. The <b class=item>Metallic Liquid</B> is easy to find: it drops off any crystalline monster in the northern desert of Plane of Valor.</P>

<P align=center><img src=images/metallic_liquid.jpg></P>

<P>The <b class=item>Hydrolyzed Ether</B> is found in the <b class=zone>Plane of Storms</B> off any of the frogs in the zone. You will probably need a group to take them out.</P>

<P align=center><img src=images/tempest_toad.jpg class=hide><BR>
<img src=images/hydrolyzed_ether.jpg></P>

<P>The <b class=item>Heavy Water</B> is found in <B class=zone>Ferubi</B>, off Corrputed Turepta in the center of the zone. You will not be able to solo this, so bring a group. You are able to invis most of the way there, but some mobs do see invis, so you will have to dispatch them. There are three turepta that spawn in the water about every 15 or 20 minutes. This drop is semi-rare, so you will be there for awhile.</P>

<P align=center><img src=images/ferubimap.png><BR>

<P>Combine the <B class=item>Heavy Water</B>, <B>Hydrolyzed Ether</B>, <B class=item>Metallic Liquid</B>, and the <B class=item>Reinforced Flask</B> in a Brew Barrel. The result is a <B>Corrosive Solution</B>. Return the <B class=item>Corrosive Solution</B> to <B class=npc>Gnapp Guinders</B> (DO NOT do this unless you are ready for the fight, or you will have to gather the components again!)</P>

<P class=quote>"Ahh! I knew bor would come through for me!" He then drops a little bit of the solution on his shackles and the chains start to steam. "FREEDOM! Now, I believe I owe you a favor as well. You were wondering about the power in Tagrin's forge. Well he trapped some huge elemental in there not long ago. I'm pretty sure with the last of this solution I have left, I could bust a hole in the side of the forge and let it out. Let me know when you are [ready] and we'll let the sparks fly."</P>

<P>When you say "Ready" the <B class=mob>Elemental Essence of Fire</B> will spawn. It's <I>HIGHLY</I> Recommended you defeat everything in the room first, before you engage the Essence.</P>

<P>The Elemental Essence of Fire hits for about 2000, and has two abilities: <a href=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1038&source=Live>Flamewall</a> and <a href=http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2812&source=Live>Pyrokinetic Hallucinations</a>, both are resistable with around 300~400 Fire Resists.

The elemental essences begin to glow and take shape. You are blinded for a moment with a flash of light, when your eyes clear he presents you with an ornate staff. 'You should be honored. You have done what few have even dreamed of. In creating this staff, it has become apparent to me that there is still [further] to go.'' <BR><BR>

Bantil Io`Tuv says 'Yes, this item represents the peak of elemental power for this realm, but in its creation I was given the gift of a vision. I saw a brief glimpse of the true power of the staff, and the next level of ascension, the next stone in your path resides in Discord. My companion, Iilivina has spent some time studying the nature of magic there. She may be able to help you find what you need, show her your new weapon, hopefully she may have some insight into how this ties into Discord. You are in the midst of a great journey, good travels.'</P>
