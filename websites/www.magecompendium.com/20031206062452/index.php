The Ornate Orb must be equipped in the primary hand to focus the pet, but the Orb of Mastery must also be equipped in the primary hand to summon the pet. Obviously you can&#39;t have two items in the same hand, so if you place such an augment (specifically the Diamond Prism of Companionship) on you Ornate Orb, you will not be able to focus your epic pet. <br><br>If you currently have the Diamond Prism of Companionship bonded to your Ornate Orb of Mastery, you may petition your GM and they will reimburse the item for you. <br><br>There&#39;s some history behind this problem, but the message above is the important thing. <br><br>When the Diamond Prism was introduced, it was not intended to focus the epic pet, and some Mages placed them on their Ornate Orb of Mastery. Recently we changed the Prism to focus Mage epic pets, and thus this problem occurred. <br><br>- Alan</font><br><br></td>

<td width="100%"><font size="2">** Quests, Adventures and Encounters **<br><br>- We have added one more new LDoN raid to Stormhammer. This raid was created with Elemental capable characters in mind.<br><br>- Changed the minimum required number of group members to request an adventure from 4 to 3.<br><br>- We have increased the consolation prize on level 65 hard adventures from 19 to 26 to match the increase in reward points for success (raised from 76 to 105 with the last update).<br><br>- Verrell Cogswin can help convert red dragon scales into green dragon scales.<br><br>- Fixed the Undead and Fire event in the Plane of Time.  There was a bug that could cause some of the minions to fail to spawn.<br><br>- Raotin Teawel will always give out the correct robe for completion of his quest.<br><br>- Thought Destroyer has returned to the Plane of Hate.<br><br>- Check with the Town Crier of your home town for news.  There is information about the recent activities of the Wayfarers that should prove interesting.<br><br>- We have made some improvements to the Plane of Air avatar rings.  We have added a random interval to the respawn time of the Plane of Air avatar rings, placed apparitions at the avatar spawns so that it is possible to tell when the event is available, and the Avatar of Smoke will now respawn properly.<br><br>- The Mujaki event in Plane of Nightmares was completely rewritten.  It should now be a lot more intelligent about where it sends players.<br><br>- Increased the number of items found at the end of a successful LDoN raid.<br><br>** Skills and Alternate Advancement **<br><br>- Channeling Focus was not giving bards the proper reduction to the chance of missing a note.  It is now fixed and gives messages to indicate when it is has helped.<br><br>- Corrected a problem that was causing Alternate Advancement buff duration increase abilities and duration focus effects to negatively affect lull spells. <br><br>- We have fixed a bug that could cause pick pocketed items to not show up on your cursor until you zone.  This could also sometimes cause the client to crash.<br><br>- Added /stoptracking command so that you no longer have to re-open the track window and hit cancel if you want to cancel your tracking quickly.<br><br>- Activated AAs from Planes of Power were not working if the user did not have Shadows of Luclin registered.  This has been fixed.<br><br>** Spells and Pets **<br><br>- The Aura of Pain Recourse can no longer be removed by Radiant Cure.<br><br>- When the character changes size (through illusion), other players will no longer see the mounted player separate from their horse.<br><br>- Magician Pets will no longer attack the caster who summoned them.<br><br>- Hitting your own pet while in a PVP area or while you have the PK flag on will no longer kill it.<br><br>- Cataclysm of Ro has had its movement rate bonus removed to fix a stacking issue with the Selo&#39;s line of movement rate songs.<br><br>- Cassindra&#39;s Chant of Clarity and Cassindra&#39;s Chorus of Clarity now lasts 3 ticks instead of being instant.<br> <br>- Cloak of Luclin, Cloak of the Akheva and Frostreaver&#39;s Blessing will no longer be overwritten by Call of the Rathe.<br> <br>- There are still some issues with Frostreaver&#39;s blessing being overwritten by some spells.  We are aware of the issue and hope to get it resolved soon.<br><br>- Protection of the Cabbage, Protection of the Glades and Protection of the Nine will block Temperance, Aegolism and Virtue.<br><br>- Ice Flame of E`ci now has the standard 2.5 second recast time.<br><br>-Reclaim energy should now function properly on the pet summoned by Child of Bertoxxulous.<br> <br>-Beastlord warders focused by Summoner&#39;s boon should now look as they should.<br><br>** Interface **<br><br>- We have added the consider color to the Target window.  The art used to display the consider color can be removed or edited via XML by custom skins.<br><br>- We have also added a 3D target indicator.  The ring color indicates the con color of the target.  This can be turned off in the Options window. A new settings file in the UI folder can be edited by players to customize the appearance of the indicator, including different animated textures for each con color and other interesting settings.<br><br>- Added /fontface command (usage /fontface <fontname>, e.g. /fontface Courier).  This will change, on the fly, the fonts used by the interface (and over character&#39;s heads).  Fonts can also be selected in the General Options page.<br><br>- Added /tell windows.  Each time you get a "tell" from a new character, a new chat window would open. That window will only display "tells" from the particular character, and any message sent from the chat window would automatically be sent as a "tell" to that character. You can turn this option on and off in the Options window.  If you have the maximum number of chat windows open when a new tell is received, the tell will go to the main chat window<br><br>- Temporary pets will no longer send their buffs to the pet window.  Generally they have none, and they would replace the buffs of any standard pet.<br><br>- The buff display portion of the pet window will now fade.<br><br>- The Auto-inventory area of the Inventory window now fades with the parent window.<br><br>- The Dump button in raid window now creates the proper, non-blank, file.<br><br>- We have also added time-stamp to Raid Dump output file.<br><br>- Pop-up dialogs no longer close when you press ESC.  This will prevent the rez dialog from being closed accidentally.<br><br>- Lay on Hands will no longer "gray out" the Inspect and Open hot keys in the Hotbutton window.  This was fixed earlier in the Actions window, but now it is fixed in the Hotbutton window as well.<br><br>- Alt-tabbing in and out of EQ should no longer cause mouse issues.<br><br>- Fixed a bug that sometimes left charmed pets health bar in the group window after the owner of that pet is killed.<br><br>- Find trader can now be cancelled in bazaar.<br><br>** Items **<br><br>- The Copper Medal of Rapture now gives a bonus to Int. instead of Wis.<br><br>** For the New Player **<br><br>- Left-clicking on an NPC prints out a message indicating what type of NPC they are and indicating that you should right-click on them.  This message can be turned off in the Options window.<br><br>- New characters will now start with a bag.<br><br>- Added a tip window that pops up when you invoke the Quantity window that explains the use of Shift and Control when selecting items.<br><br>- All characters will gain a Sense Heading skill of 200, if it was below 200.  All new characters will start with a Sense Heading of 200.<br><br>** Miscellaneous **<br><br>- Explore mode works properly again.<br><br>** UI Files **<br><br>* Changed *<br><br>EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml<br>EQUI_TargetWindow.xml<br>EQUI_Animations.xml<br><br>* New *<br><br>Targetindicator.ini<br>TargetBox.tga<br>TargetIndicator.tga</font><br><br></td>

<td width="100%"><font size="2">Here are some things we&#39;re working on for the November update: (Please note: my producer is making me tell you that in addition to this list, we&#39;ll still be bug fixing and maintaining the live game and that, while we hope to get each of these features in, nothing is certain. But this is what we&#39;re working on at the present time.) <br><br>New LDoN raids will go Live - We be moving the two new raids that were introduced on Stormhammer to the Live servers. These raids will prove an interesting challenge for the best of guilds. <br><br>Another new LDoN raid - We will also be bringing one more new LDoN raid to Stormhammer with our next update. This raid will be created with Elemental capable characters in mind. <br><br>Font changes - Since EverQuest was launched, there has only been one font available. With the next update we plan to introduce the option for players to choose the font for their interface. <br><br>Targeting - Sometimes it can be difficult to tell which NPC you have targeted. With the next update we hope to add a targeting indicator of some sort (something like the ring that surrounds your target in EQOA). The exact form hasn&#39;t been decided, but the goal is to make seeing what you currently have targeted much easier. <br><br>Consider - Along the same lines as the proposed improvement to targeting, we want to add a way to distinguish the /con color of your target. We plan an indicator that will be easily distinguished once you have a target (probably someplace in the Target window), that should remove the need to use the /con command. <br><br>Other interface changes - We are also working on some other changes that will help you to organize your information. We plan to add a new text color option for damage shield reports that will allow you to pick what color those messages use. We also want to split the "My Pet Attacks" filter into two separate filters, one for hits and one for misses. <br><br>/tell windows - It is very easy to lose /tells in the confusion of combat. We want to add an option that would work much like an instant messenger. Each time you get a "tell" from a new character, a new chat window would open. That window will only display "tells" from the particular character, and any message sent from the chat window would automatically be sent as a "tell" to that character. Obviously this would be an optional feature. <br><br>Help for new players - New characters will start with a bag. This will give them a little more storage space and the opportunity to learn how storage containers work earlier rather than later. We are also working on removing one of the more tedious "features" of the game, the need to practice Sense Heading. Most folks have that skill mapped to trigger along with one of their movement keys. Not an exciting skill to practice. So we plan to have all characters start with a 200 skill in Sense Heading. This will allow new players to navigate more easily, and will reduce a bit of tedium over the course of gameplay.</font><br><br></td>

<td width="100%"><font size="2">** Zones and NPCs **<br><br>- Two new raid zones have been added to the Lost Dungeons on the Legends server.  These are Guk-themed raids, one for Elemental Plane and one for Time Plane capable raiders.<br><br>- The revamped Plane of Mischief is now available on all Live servers.<br><br>- There were some situations where the warders in Vex Thal could be up, but the bosses needed to kill them would not be available.  That shouldn&#39;t happen anymore.<br><br>- Shrunk the giant wolves that appeared in the lands. <br><br>- The Coirnav encounter has been changed.  Be much more careful if you have been relying on stuns to deal with this encounter.<br><br>- Corrected an issue with the Filth Gorgers that was causing them to remain around with they were supposed to despawn.<br><br>- Soldiers of Madness in Grieg&#39;s End will no longer be so unbelievably numerous.<br><br>- Zoning into the Plane of Fire will no longer cause characters to occasionally take 20k points of damage.<br><br>- The Froglok Hunter and Forager will no longer be killed by the inhabitants of Trakanon&#39;s Teeth, so they should be easier to find.<br><br>- When Mithaniel Marr is killed, his planar projection now spawns in the middle of his room rather than at the point of death.  This fixes a problem that could cause the projection to appear out of reach.<br><br>- The Qeynos investigator is now taking "follow me" orders again.<br><br>** Adventures **<br><br>- Every character that successfully completes an adventure will now get at least one point as a reward.   This is also true for the "consolation" rewards.<br><br>- Completing Hard adventures will yield more points.<br><br>- Several trap spells on interactive objects have had their severity reduced.<br><br>- Added some new type 7 and type 8 augmentations to various adventure merchants.<br><br>- It will be clearer now which raids are "hard" and which are "normal".  Hard raids are intended for Time capable guilds.  They are very hard.<br><br>- All raid recruiters now properly check to be sure that you have completed two adventures in their respective themes before they will give out the raid.<br><br>- Fixed an issue in a Mistmoore&#39;s Catacomb raid that was preventing players from accessing an interactive object they had earned for killing Sfisithik.<br><br>- Removed the ability to see through Shroud of Stealth from some of the NPCs that appear in LDoN Raids.<br><br>- There was a misconception about the behavior of goblins in some Rujarkian Hills adventures.  Goblins that are fleeing because they are unwilling to die or are seeking help will make it clear that they are doing so.  We also corrected an issue that could cause these goblins to "ping pong" in some cases.<br><br>- All of the "flavor" NPCs in dungeons (usually those that are lying down, nearly dead) will display full health to make it impossible to tell what kind of NPC they are (friend or foe) simply by looking at their health level.<br><br>- Hostages will no longer be attacked by their captors.<br><br>- We thinned out the population in the Grand Library and a few other Miragul&#39;s Menagerie themed zones to bring the challenge in line.<br><br>- Rats in Mistmoore&#39;s Catacombs are now animals, shadows are now summoned.<br><br>** Items and Objects **<br><br>- Corrected a bug that allowed players to buy multiple lore augmentations if they were in a bag (which also caused issues when trying to loot corpses with those items).  If you had multiple lore items, the extra items will be removed.  A refund for the points spent on those items will be made when they are deleted.<br><br>- Broken Chunk of Coal, Cracked Ruby, and Charred Pebble are no longer valid augmentations.  If you had these augmentations bonded to an item, you will find them on your cursor.  You can take those items to Dible Hedledrap in South Ro and he will restore your adventure points.<br><br>- Perfect Garnet of Constitution, Pristine Garnet of Constitution, Perfect Sapphire of Insight, and Pristine Sapphire of Insight can be turned in to Dible Heldedrap in South Ro.  He will replace them with type 8 versions of the same items.<br><br>- Changed pre-LDoN items to have a single slot of type 7 instead of 1.  Some LDoN items which had a slot type 1 were also changed to type 7.<br><br>- Fixed a bug with the Adventurer&#39;s Stone that would sometimes cause it to not display its bonuses.<br><br>- Interactive objects will now only appear on LDoN raids when the main boss has been killed. This change was done to prevent an exploit, and is a temporary change.<br><br>- We have improved the types of rewards that can be found in interactive objects to improve the reward given for the risk taken by opening them.<br><br>- Fixed a bug that prevented augments with no deity restrictions from combining with deity-restricted items.<br><br>- Added a message that should make it clearer when a character is unable to loot an interactive object because they are on an NPC&#39;s hate list.<br><br>- Hand-to-hand weapons are now part of the one-handed restriction on augmentations.  So augmentations that say they can be used with one-handed items will also work with hand-to-hand items.<br><br>- Geomancer&#39;s Crown of Reformation now fits in the head slot and the effect is worn instead of right clicked.<br><br>- Gravestone of Dire Melodies and the Limestone Shard of Battle Cries will now properly modify instrument skills.<br><br>- All of Royal Attendant Armor will now show up as plate armor.<br><br>- Rogue pets focused with Summoner&#39;s Boon should no longer lose the ability to backstab.<br><br>- Shard of Shrunken Bone was changed from Shield of Pain III to Shield of Pain II.<br><br>- Changed many of the new Lost Dungeons "shields" to make them useable as shields (they can be used to bash now).<br><br>- Removed augmentation slots from the following items: Primal Velium Knight&#39;s Sword, Divine Hammer of Consternation, Breezeboot&#39;s Frigid Gnasher, Primal Velium Fist Wraps, Primal Velium Battlehammer, Primal Velium Spear, Primal Velium Claidhmore, Primal Velium Brawl Stick, Primal Velium War Lance, Primal Velium Reinforced Bow, Primal Velium Battle Axe, Primal Velium Warsword, Ancient Prismatic Bow, Ancient Prismatic Lance, Ancient Prismatic Spear, Ancient Prismatic Claymore, Ancient Prismatic Brawl Stick, Ancient Prismatic Battlehammer, Ancient Prismatic Warsword, Ancient Prismatic Axe, Ancient Prismatic Fist Wraps, Ancient Prismatic Staff, Ancient Prismatic Stiletto, and Ancient Prismatic Mace.<br><br>- Changed some weapons dropped from rare NPC&#39;s in LDoN zones to have slot type 4 instead of 1.<br><br>- Changed Pristine Limestone of Hatred to Vengeance IV.<br><br>- The hp/mana augmentations that dropped in adventures as slot 1 items will no longer drop.  They have been replaced with similar items that fit into slot 7.<br><br>- Made changes to various stats and effects on Plane of Time items.<br><br>- Changed the level required to use the right-click effect on Wild Lord Armor to 45, to match all other Kunark armor.<br><br>- Corrected a bug with mounts that would sometimes leave the horse buff up without the actual mount.  Also corrected a problem that could cause a player to be unable to summon a mount.<br><br>- Fixed the haste on Spiritbound Mystic&#39;s Torch <br><br>- Altered the damage and delay on the Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic to be more appropriate for where it drops<br><br>** For the New Player **<br><br>- Find Feature added.  This will create a mystical indication of the path to take to find certain people.  This feature works in the Bazaar and in newbie zones and cities.  In the Bazaar you just click on the merchant you seek in the Bazaar window and click the Find Trader button.  For all other uses, just hit CTRL+F to open the window, select someone on the list and click the Find button.  This will locate any Bazaar trader or any NPC with an alternate name, such as (Spell Vendor).  The exception is that it will not locate NPCs in the Wayfarer&#39;s Camps.<br><br>- The auto-attack key now defaults to Q (not A). <br><br>- New characters start with their weapons and armor equipped.<br><br>- New characters start with their spells scribed and memorized.<br><br>- When a caster reaches the level required for one of the first two rings of new spells, they will get a message informing them that new spells are available.  <br><br>- New characters will begin with a stack of bandages.  These bandages cannot be sold or traded.<br><br>- When a character trains in a hotbutton-able skill that he did not previously have skill in, a hotbutton for that skill is created on the cursor.<br><br>- New characters will have a page of hotbuttons set for them based on the skills given to them by their class and race.<br><br>** Interface **<br><br>- Merchants now separate items with different charges in their list. For example, 9 dose and 10 dose potions will show up as separate items on the merchant&#39;s list.  Items with the same amount of charges will be stacked.  NOTE: This will remove the ability to "recharge" items by selling them to a vendor and buying them back.<br><br>- The Bazaar now supports selling different charged items. For example, a 10 dose potion with 9 charges can be sold for 90 plat., while a 10 dose version of the same potion can be sold for 100 plat.  NOTE: All currently priced charged items will no longer have a price attached and will need to be reset by the trader.<br><br>- Pet buffs are now visible in the pet window. A small icon will display for each buff on the pet (up to 30 - you may need to resize the pet window).  You can hover your mouse over the icon to see the spell name.  Alt left-click or right-click and hold for spell info box (which only contains name and icon).<br> <br>- Improved the functionality of the ESC key.  Windows close in the opposite order that they were opened.<br><br>- Swarm pet damage is filtered under "pet damage" rather than "others hits".<br><br>- When World Containers (ovens, kilns, augmentation sealers and similar items) are closed, No Drop items in those containers will be placed in the character&#39;s inventory.  If it will not fit there, it will appear on their cursor.<br><br>- The "Only show items I can use" option in the Adventure Merchant window will be saved when you log out.<br><br>- Hotbuttons created using the Abilities and Combat skill lists are no longer connected to the buttons in the Actions window.  This means that you can create a button on the Abilities or Combat section of the actions window, drag that button to the hotbutton window, then change the button on the Abilities or Combat section, and the hotbutton you made will not change.  This allows you to create hotbuttons for ALL of your character&#39;s skills, not just the ones that can fit in the Actions window.<br><br>- You can now use the (`) key to "Target nearest NPC", in addition to F8. <br><br>- Shared bank slots will no longer accept rentable containers with no-rent items in them.<br><br>- A new system for the leaderboard has been implemented to track adventures by their difficulty.  You can sort by normal/hard/all difficulty.  Not only will this display the stats for the leaders, but you will also be able to see your own successes and failures at the bottom, based on the sorting you chose for the leaderboard.  So, for example, if you filter the leaderboard by Miragul&#39;s Wins and choose Hard, you will not only see the leaders for Hard adventures in that theme, you will see your own statistics for Hard Miragul&#39;s adventures.  NOTE:  Because this tracking is new, it will only be able to differentiate hard and normal adventures from the time of this update onward.  Past adventures will be treated as if they were normal difficulty. <br><br>- /autojoin is not saved per character, not for all characters.<br><br>- The Open and Inspect buttons are no longer "grayed-out" when Lay on Hands or Harm Touch are used.<br><br>- Merchant inventories will refresh properly after a character purchases the last of an item in inventory.<br><br>** Spells **<br><br>- Casting Grow on an unshrunk shaman pet will no longer shrink the pet.<br><br>- Remove Minor Curse cures 2 curse counters instead of 3-4.<br><br>- Lich and Pact of Hate now use different colored skeleton models.<br><br>- Monster Summoning will summon the correct models, not just earth elementals.<br><br>- Frostreaver&#39;s Blessing will no longer block the bard song Wind of Marr.  We realize there are still some stacking issues with these spells, and we hope to resolve them soon.<br><br>** Tradeskills **<br><br>- The Blessed Steel Arrowheads recipe will return the file.<br><br>- NPC Merchants will now pay less for Steel Hunter Arrows, Steel Arrowshafts, and Steel Fletch.<br><br>- The Muckskipper Chowder recipe no longer returns a pot on a failure or success, since the recipe does not require a pot at all.<br><br>- The recipe for the "Lemming Fur Backpack" now requires an Embroidering Needle instead of a Sewing Needle.<br><br>** Alternate Advancement **<br><br>- Jewelcraft Mastery works properly now.<br><br>- Frenzied Burnout will no longer last indefinitely on a charmed pet.<br><br>** UI Files **<br><br>* Changed *<br><br>EQUI.xml<br>EQUI_ActionsWindow.xml<br>EQUI_AdventureLeaderboardWnd.xml<br>EQUI_BazaarSearchWnd.xml<br>EQUI_LootWnd.xml<br>EQUI_OptionsWindow.xml<br>EQUI_PetInfoWindow.xml<br>EQUI_RaidWindow.xml<br><br>* New *<br><br>EQUI_FindLocationWnd.xml<br><br>* New Labels *<br><br>86-115 for the pet buff names.</font><br><br></td>

It seems that, the more you help them in their cause, the more they&#39;re willing to share...<br><br>If you have purchased Lost Dungeons, thank you and welcome&#33; <br><br>If you haven&#39;t -- What are you waiting for?   Order now and join the grand Adventure&#33;<br><br>*** Game Updates ***<br><br>** Items **<br><br>- Warrior and Magician epic changes  A new version of these two epic items is available to accommodate the new item augmentations.  Both of these epics are basically summoned items, and therefore they would lose any augmentations when used or unsummoned.  Players wishing to change these items into "permanent" versions in order to augment them should do the following:<br><br>Warrior Epic - Talk to Gartrog Smitehammer in East Freeport.  He will replace your Red Scabbard and Jagged Blade of War with augmentable versions of the Jagged Blade of War, the Blade of Strategy, and the Blade of Tactics.  You will not receive the Red Scabbard back, as it will no longer be useful to you.<br><br>Magician Epic - Talk to Ilisiv Gantrau in the Tox Forest.  She will take a summoned Orb of Mastery and replace it with a permanent augmentable orb.  The epic pet is still summoned in exactly the same way, with no changes to the spell or use.<br><br>** Zones and Quests **<br><br>- Plane of Mischief - We have updated the factions for a few NPCs for this zone on Stormhammer only.  All of the NPCs there are meant to be aggressive. Some of them were on the wrong faction, and were not aggressive.  They are now.<br><br>- The Deep - There were some NPCs in this zone that could see invisible but were bugged to be non-aggressive.  They will again be aggressive, so be more cautious when using invisibility in The Deep.<br><br>- Plane of Valor - The Aerin&#39;Dar projection was despawning after only a few minutes.  It will now remain as long as other projections.<br><br>- City of Mist - Black Reavers are immune to magic once again.<br><br>- Oxidized Steel Plate will now drop.  This should allow the completion of the Rallicans Bracer quest<br><br>- The Ghost of Kindle has returned.<br><br>- Manastone is no longer usable in The Hole.<br><br>- The trader limit increase mentioned in the last update should be working properly now.<br><br>** Spells **<br><br>- We have reduced the cost of the Summon Wooden, Stone and Iron Bracelet spells. <br><br>- We have added new Skeleton models for pets, illusions, and transformation spells.<br><br>- We have changed the underlying way that pet focus items work to allow for future upgrades and items.  All existing foci should work as they always have.  If you notice anything unusual when using a pet focus, please /bug report the issue.<br><br>** Interface **<br><br>- Context Tips - We have added a question mark symbol to windows that have help information available.  Just click on the question mark in the upper right of the window to see the tips.<br><br>** Miscellaneous **<br><br>- Fixed a bug that was causing NPCs to appear to have a larger melee range than they should have in some cases.<br><br>- Sullon Zek - There was a bug that allowed players to create characters on opposing alliances.  That is no longer possible.  If you see this message: <br><br>"You currently have characters created on opposing deity alliances. You can only have characters that are on the same alliance.  Please correct this by deleting the character that was recently created and has an opposing alliance with the first character you created." <br><br>You will not be able to log in until you delete any characters that are not on the same alliance.<br><br>** UI Files **<br><br>* Changed *<br><br>SIDL.xml<br>EQUI_Templates.xml<br>EQUI_Animations.xml<br>EQUI.xml<br>dragitem27.tga<br>window_pieces01.tga<br><br>* New *<br><br>EQUI_AdventureRequestWnd.xml<br>EQUI_AdventureMerchantWnd.xml<br>EQUI_AdventureLeaderboardWnd.xml<br>EQUI_AdventureStatsWnd.xml<br><br>** Known Issues **<br> <br>This is the list of cosmetic issues that we&#39;re aware aren&#39;t perfect, but determined as acceptable to launch with, as none should affect peoples&#39; ability to enjoy the game.  <br> <br>Rather than attempt last-minute changes that often break more than they fix, these will be addressed in an update after Lost Dungeons&#39; launch.<br> <br>- Paladins and Shadowknights:  The new INSPECT and OPEN ability buttons will *appear* disabled for the duration of your Harm Touch or Lay Hands timers when you use those abilities.  You may still use INSPECT and OPEN, however.  It just won&#39;t look like you can.<br> <br>- When receiving an adventure from one of the Wayfarers&#39; Camps, for now, the Adventure Window does not automatically close when you walk away from the Adventure Recruiter as it should.  <br> <br>- Pet Users:  If you tell your pet to attack an interactive object (chest, vase, coffin, etc) inside of a dungeon, your pet will tell you that it is attacking, but it will not actually attack.  This is a problem with the message, not the behavior.  The pet should be telling you that it cannot attack such a thing.<br><br>** Use Augmentations Wisely **<br><br>If you have an item with more than one slot available and you intend to apply an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot (i.e. Type 1), be sure to apply it last.<br><br>For example, you have an item with three slots available and you have filled Slot 1 with an Augmentation Item.  In your bag you have an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot on the item (i.e. Type 1) and one that fits into Slot 2.  If you use the Type 1 Augmentation Item first, it will fill the first open slot on your item, which would be Slot 2 in this case.  This means you will not be able to use the Slot 2-specific Augmentation Item you had available. <br><br>So, remember, the rule is that if you have an Augmentation Item that can be used it any slot, be sure to apply it last&#33;</font><br><br></td>

<td width="100%"><font size="2">Todays patch <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/09/01/wveg01.xml" target="_top">sounded promising</a> but the end result tastes like it has been blown into by an Italian oboe player.  (Tenenous, I know.  You try and think of patch references that Moorgard hasn&#39;t already murdered.)<br><br>The most important features we were promised for today have been delayed by "internal data restructuring", whatever that means, so we&#39;re left with a raftlet of minor changes.<br><br>Magicians can now summon <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spelllist.html?searchtext=burning+affliction" target="_top">Burning Affliction</a> focus items for our DoT casting friends.  And now we have a reason to whip out our uniquely functionless Velious DoTs&#33;  For a joke. <br><br>Our summoned ammunition containers now come completely rather than half full (Saving The World 60 Mana At A Time).  I just hope the ammo itself stacks on the cursor when summoned for easy dropping rather than coming in the bag as the patch message seems to imply.<br><br>Once again, we&#39;re just behind some barbarian no one cares about, this time to Solusek C (or perhaps Solusek The Third).  I have 50pp on there being a Crushbone B by the end of the year.  There are also some changes that will interest string-wearing, button-lacking ogre enchanters who fletch, but I lost interest when a skim reading revealed that my favourite exploits haven&#39;t been nerfed.<br><br>The biggest news of today is what we didn&#39;t get.  Absent is the scam-busting (not to mention immersion-killing and customer service budget-reducing) shared platinum slot, as is the fantastically promising pet melee filter.  Hopefully Verant is using this extra time to add a filter that shows pet spell damage and ensuring that pet melee damage is shown zone wide - having to stand under a mob to see how hard your pet is hitting it would be ridiculous.<br><br>Verant should also add a filter for pet command responses (I beg forgiveness master&#33;) or add a toggle that puts all of them in tells.  Currently pet messages are divided across tells (of two colours) and say.  Of course, the vital commands that keep a raid safe (/pet hold, /pet back off, /pet get lost) all produce annoying messages in say which are bizarrely filtered as "Other" along with all NPC text.<br><br><a href="http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=6566" target="_top">Discuss</a><br><br><b>August 6, 2003<br>------------------------------</b><br><br>Note:  Some internal data restructuring created a delay in the introduction of the new platinum slot in the shared bank and the new text filters.  We will bring those to the Live servers as soon as we can.<br><br><b>** New Adventure in Lavastorm&#33; **</b><br><br>In the depths of the Lavastorm Mountains there is only one ruler.  But even his burning breath and power have their limits.  Rumor has it that there is wealth and danger in locations even further below the boiling lands than Lord Nagafen can reach.  These tales have been spreading like ripples on a calm lake, and their point of origin appears to be an upstart barbarian named Morden.  Some say that he&#39;s already delved these fabled caverns and taken what there was of value.  Other say that he couldn&#39;t have carried it all off by himself.  But most say that he&#39;s a rogue, a teller of tales, and not to be trusted.  Will you discover the truth and brave the heat, or will you sit beside your cozy campfire and listen to stories?<br><br>This new adventure zone will only be around for a while, so you may want to visit soon.<br><br><b>** Spells **</b><br><br>- Summoned Burning Affliction focus items added - Mages have four new spells, Summon Wooden Bracelet, Summon Stone Bracelet, Summon Iron Bracelet, and Summon Steel Bracelet.  The bracelets summoned provide the Burning Affliction effect for DoT spells.<br><br>- Summoned container spells updated - The Quiver of Marr, Bandoleer of Luclin and the Pouch of Quellious now appear filled with the appropriate item (for example, the Quiver of Marr now appears with six stacks of arrows).  Also, these items should all be exactly the same, so the quiver function should work properly.<br><br>- Mass Enchant spells corrected - The mass enchant spells for Adamantite, Brellium, Mithril and Steel now create the 5 enchanted blocks that they should.<br><br>- Illusion: Guktan is available - This is an illusion spell for the new Froglok models.<br><br>- Illusion: Scaled Wolf is available - This is an illusion spell for the Scaled Wolf seen in Kunark.<br><br>- Tiny Companion - The spell scroll for this spell is no longer No Drop.<br><br>- Dooming Darkness no longer overwrites Cascading Darkness.<br><br><b>** Items **</b><br><br>- Moss Covered Hood - This item can now be equipped by all classes.<br><br>- Silk String - This item is now stackable.<br><br><b>** Trade Skills **</b><br><br>- New Fletching recipes added - We&#39;ve added several new Karana-only fletching recipes to help round out that skill.<br><br><b>** Quests and Zones **</b><br><br>- Halls of Betrayal - Corrected an error with some of the quest item drops in this zone.<br><br>- Plane of Time - The events in Plane of Time B now remember the progress your raid has made through the zone when you leave and will restore you to the same state when you return.<br><br>- Kagazz will respond when you ask him about fasteners.<br><br>- Experience in city zones updated - Some time around the release of Planes of Power we reduced the experience gain in some city zones.  Tthe experience gained from quests in those zone has been increased.<br><br>- Ogre newbie quests - Added a weapon quest for young ogres.<br><br>- Iksar Necromancer Spell Vendors - The Iksar necromancer spell vendors have moved and are a lot closer to the necromancer guild.  This should make it easier for new necromancers to find these vendors and will hopefully boost their sales.<br><br><b>** Miscellaneous **</b><br><br>- Spell book bug - Corrected a bug that was causing characters to be randomly forced to stand up when in their spell book.<br><br>- Client crash information - If your game crashes on the client side, a dialogue box will come up asking if you&#39;d like to send us the information about the crash.  This information may help us pinpoint problems and make it easier to fix them.  Only information relevant to the crash, your character name, server name and the zone you were in will be sent.<br><br><b>** Fan Faire **</b><br><br>Chicago Fan Faire is sneaking up on us&#33; The Chicago event will be held September 26-28th, and the last day to guarantee your spot at the event by pre-registering is September 8th.  To reserve your spot and pre-register, or to simply get more information, please go to www.everquest.com/fanfaire.  See you in Chicago&#33;</font><br><br></td>
