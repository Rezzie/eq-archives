Vie, Sionachie, Thubr Axebringer, Sir Jevik Isqual, Al`Kabor, Dreezil Pocketdip,
Dagda Icefury, Ognit Eznertob, Dabner Drednever, and Lyirae Oakwynd arrived at
the tiny Elven stronghold in the new lands. Tired from their journey, they
stepped off of the Maiden's Voyage and began to rest for a few moments. Galeth
Veredeth came to greet them as they were resting.<br>
<br>
Galeth Veredeth shouts &quot;Lieutenant Thorn! Please do me the honor of taking
our friends on a tour of the surrounding area&quot;<br>
<br>
The Lieutenant approached the group and began to lead them out of town. As they
were walking along, the Lieutenant made an effort to point out the creatures and
structures to Firiona and her companions. He informed them that the Iksar are an
ancient race. The ruins that lie all about the land show that the Iksar were a
great empire whose influence seemed to stretch the length of the continent. 1900
years ago, the Iksar attempted to attack and take control of Faydwer but the
navy was wiped out by a terrible storm and they were not successful. Something
terrible happened to cause the once great empire to crumble. None of the local
inhabitants of the area seem very friendly with the exception being the Drixies.<br>
<br>
As the party began to walk back, Danak Dhorentath, an Iksar shaman shouted
&quot;Visitors! Watch your backs, the Drolvarg are attacking!&quot; At that
moment, four Drolvarg appeared and ambushed the group. Danak and an Iksar
Initiate joined the group in fighting the Drolvarg. After the Drolvarg were
dead, Danak asked if everyone was alright.<br>
<br>
While Firiona was explaining to Danak that they were seeking out the Ring of
Scale, he seemed generally concerned for their safety. He told them that their
journey would be incredibly long and dangerous. Danak offered a quicker means
for them to get there. He offered the use of his special portal. Within a few
moments, with serpentine speed, Danak Dhorentath grabbed Firiona Vie by the arm.
Taking her by surprise he pulled her into the gate, which disappeared with a
hiss leaving nothing more than the smell of ozone hanging in the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;I must return and tell King Thex the terrible news. Bind the vile Iksar at
once! Dagda, Thubr, Jevik and I will escort the prisoner back to the
mainland!&quot; Galeth Veredeth shouted.<br>
<br>
They escorted the Initiate to the Maiden's Voyage and traveled to Faydwer.</font></span></p>
