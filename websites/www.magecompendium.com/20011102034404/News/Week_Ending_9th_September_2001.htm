<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Corpses with no
experience on them, I think at least, would be ones that were sacrificed for
essence emeralds and duels. IIRC dueled corpses don't have experience giving
ability on them, because you don't lose any you can't gain any back when you get
resurrected. Please correct if I'm wrong.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You're not wrong. I had forgotten
about duels, the perfect example of a corpse that doesn't have any experience.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Sorry, but that
just confused me more. Does this mean that a level 29 or lower character's naked
corpse would poof in 3 minutes, instead of the 3 hours granted to 30+? I hope
I'm misunderstanding this, as that would be gravely unfair.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Empty corpses last 3 minutes
unless the owner of the corpse is level 30 or more, which last 3 hours.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You are understanding that
correctly. There's not really anything unfair about that. The only reason to
have a naked corpse around is for experience granting resurrection, something
that is relatively rare for folks under level 30. And those under level 30 that
think they might get a resurrection should leave items on their corpses.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bodies take up computer resources.
Our servers have to track them, and your computer has to draw them. We need to
remove the corpses that aren't necessary to reduce the overhead. The current
system works well.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I very much
disagree with the use of the term: 'whichever comes first' in your explaination
of corpse decay time.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">It is not only a
lie, but in being so, is very misleading - and has cause me and other people i
know to lose level 40+ corpses...</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The term
'whichever comes first' very much, directly stating - 'either this one or that
one, whichever of the options first occur'. But that's not true!</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">You don't get
either 24hrs online - or - 1 week offline time. You definatly do not get
whichever of the 2 comes first - they are both one and the same as you apply
them.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">IE: if I spend
12hrs online - and 5 days offline my corpse will decay. Yet according to what
you say, I have until I reach 24hrs online - or 7 days offline. Neither have
occured, therefore neither came first - why does my corpse still decay?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, I notice that
since the last time I complained about this, you added the 'note'. It does
mention that 1hr online counts as 7hrs offline. Although it doesn't state the
other half of the truth - which is that 7hrs offline - also counts as 1hr of
your online counter. As it is only one counter - you can't properly use the
terms or or 'Whichever comes first' when discussing only one thing. (ergo one
decay counter).</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Simply removing
the 'whichever comes first' from that corpse decay description would do SO much
towards making this 'accurate' let alone readable. It would also be nice if you
fully explained the whole relation between 1hr online = 7hrs offline and vis a
versa.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The way it is now
written, not only is inaccurate, and misleading - but as I've previously
mentioned. This very mis-print of yours has caused me and countless others to
lose corpses and many good items. (one item i lost is irreplacable as it came as
result of being in like 5 or 6 seperate GM quests - and this now tainted view
will probably stop me from ever again spending the time to do GM quests - as fun
as they are)</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Thanks for
listening to my little rant...</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, it's not a 'lie'. It is,
however, certainly misleading.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is, indeed, only one timer
on a corpse. If you have a 6th level or higher, experience giving, non-naked
corpse in game and you spend 12 hours playing and then 3.5 days not playing,
your corpse will indeed be gone.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'll rewrite that bit and try to
make it less confusing.</font>

  corpses that are not empty one-hour in game is the same as seven hours out of

  not. If you have a level 12 corpse with items on it in the game and spend 12
  hours playing and 3.5 days out of game, that corpse will be gone. Also, be
  advised that leaving your computer at the character select screen or play on
  another character on that same account counts as time in game as it relates to
  the corpse decay timer.</font></p>

reminder. We still don't know how the map is maintained.<br>
<br>
- Welfin<br>
</font><br>
That's true…<br>
<br>
I've been thinking about that since we put the maps up. I'm not so sure that
announcing how control is determined is such a good idea, for two reasons.<br>
<br>
First, it's not really an exact science. We're limited by a few things, not the
least of which is that the more things we keep track of to use for creating
stats and maps and such, the bigger load we put on the server.<br>
<br>
But more importantly, if we announce how it's done that might make it very easy
for some one (or some group) to tweak the system and give us false numbers
through some sort of trick that would invalidate the results.<br>
<br>
I am curious, though, as to what method you folks think would work best. Though
we're not really ready to invest time on changing the current system right now,
we might be able to do so in the future, and any interesting new ideas would be
welcome.<br>
<br>
Just keep in mind the restriction that some of the wilder ideas are going to be
impossible…<br>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">There seems to be
some confusion regarding how long naked corpses last before they poof. From the
Feb. 21, 2001 patch message: &quot;Naked PC corpses that have experience and are
above level 30 will now last 3 hours instead of 3 minutes.&quot;</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I take this to
mean that if you die naked, in order for your corpse not to poof in 3 minutes,
you must have earned some experience since the time of your last death. To
prevent this, I often bum a copper or rusty weapon from someone while performing
a coprse retrieval. However, many people state that putting something in your
inventory is not necessary to prevent naked corpse poofing, since your character
has experience (unless it is level one).</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">A little clarity,
please?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It means that if you can gain
experience from a resurrection done on that corpse, then the corpse will remain.
I can't think of any examples of corpses that won't give experience back from an
experience giving resurrection (perhaps sacrifice victims...), but if there were
any, then they would only be around for 3 minutes if there was nothing on the
corpse.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Continuing its international
expansion in the pursuit of the first true global gaming community, Sony Online
Entertainment (SOE) and Ubi Soft announced today that EverQuest®, the world's
largest massively multiplayer online game, will be hosted on new servers in the
European market. Beginning this winter, Europe's most popular online game will
be even more accessible and international gamers will be able to enjoy a
localized EverQuest experience.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;We are committed to bringing
online gaming to everyone, everywhere,&quot; said Kelly Flock, President, Sony
Online Entertainment. &quot;The roll out of our first European servers mark the
beginning of our global initiatives and we are committed to continuing these
efforts to meet the demands of our growing global community.&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">EverQuest already boasts more than
400,000 members across the world and is poised to grow as servers are deployed
into new nations. With over 6 million online gamers in Europe alone, localized
servers will offer lower latency for a heightened interactive experience for
this growing market. The first overseas hub will launch in the U.K. this winter
and additional servers will rollout as each market ripens.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Congruent with its international
plans, the company recently announced that its premier online gaming site, The
Station (<a href="http://www.station.com" target="_blank"><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000"><b>www.station.com</b></span></font></a>),
with more than ten million members worldwide, will roll out localized content
and advanced translation software for premium games while offering new payment
options to overseas customers. Through advanced translation software, players
will enjoy in-game and web chat even if they do not share a common language.
Phase one of the localization process includes human translating agents for
French, German, Japanese and Korean beginning with the upcoming expansion pack
EverQuest®: The Shadows of Luclin™. EverQuest® Game Cards™ are being made
available around the world at retail giving the wider, cash holding audience
access to The Station's premium content including EverQuest and the up coming
PlanetSide™ and Star Wars® Galaxies™</font></p>
