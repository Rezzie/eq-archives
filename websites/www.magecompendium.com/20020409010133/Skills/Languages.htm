Earthgate, Nameless Server</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">So you want to be a polyglot? Well, we can help
you. This guide will explain the easiest and quickest way to learn and train
languages in EverQuest.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Some Basic Facts About Languages</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The maximum skill you can have in a language is
100, or Excellent.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Everyone speaks Common Tongue when they start.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Most races speak at least one additional
language to start. Elves all speak Elvish, Dwarves speak Dwarvish, Dark Elves
speak Teir'dal (Dark Elvish), etc.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You don't need to train a point (at your
guildmaster) in a language to learn it. All you have to do is find someone who
speaks it. (In fact, *ever* using training points in a language is a complete
and utter waste, unless you are utterly incapable of finding someone to teach
you.)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Someone can only teach you a language up to 1
point higher than they themselves speak the language (to a maximum of 100, of
course). This means that if Rokinon the Dwarf knows the Lizardman language at
skill level 73, he can only teach it to you until you hit level 74. (So why not
just immediately teach him up to 75, then have him teach you to 76, etc. Well,
you'll see. Read on!)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When you get better at a language, it doesn't
tell you what level you're at, just that you've improved.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">How to Learn Languages</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The easiest way to learn a language is to find
another player who speaks it, and is willing to teach it to you. Here is the
quickest way to teach another player a language.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, reprogram one of your social hotkeys to
contain the following five commands:</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">/g This is a test language
  message 1.<br>
  /g This is a test language message 2.<br>
  /g This is a test language message 3.<br>
  /g This is a test language message 4.<br>
  /g This is a test language message 5.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You'll use this button every time you want to
teach someone a language. (It doesn't really matter what the text actually is,
as long as it starts with the /g command, so that you'll be saying it to your
group.)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Next, drag the social button into a hotkey
slot. Then, in windowed mode, right-click on your text box to get to the
language box. At the top is shown the current language you are speaking in.
Left-click on it to cycle through all the languages you know. For example, if
you want to teach someone Dwarvish, left-click until the language changes to
Dwarvish. Then, right-click again to get back to the main text box.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">(You can also use the /lang command to switch
languages. /lang by itself will show you what language you are currently
speaking, and what number language it is; if you use /lang N, where N is the
number of a language, it will switch to that language. However there is no good
way to get a list of all the languages and their numbers, because which number
corresponds to which language is dependent on what languages you know. But if
you do know the numbers, the /lang command is faster than right-clicking on the
chat box.)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now you are ready to teach. The person you want
to teach the language to has to be in your group, so group up with them. (I
don't actually know if you have to be in the same zone, but I do believe so.)
Then, go somewhere safe like a city or near some NPC guards. Then click on your
hotkey (or use the keyboard, whatever you prefer) rapidly and repeatedly. Text
will scroll by in the text box far faster than you can read, and your groupmate
will see all of the messages you are sending. However, instead of seeing:</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Teramenor says, 'This is a
  test language message 1.'</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Your groupmate will see:</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Teramenor says in a language
  you do not understand, 'Tkal nr a ntet ndjguare mrwkjwe 1.'</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">This is because he doesn't speak the language, so
it appears garbled.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As you continue pounding on the hotkey, every
so often (depending on his Intelligence) your groupmate will see a message
scroll by:</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFF00">Your language skills have
  improved!</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Unlike other skills, where you might see something
like <font color="#0000ff">'</font><font color="#FFFFFF">You have gotten better
at 2H Bashing (14)!'</font>, the language improvement message not only doesn't
tell you what level your language skill is at, it doesn't even tell you what
language you're learning.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because your groupmate's text box is constantly
being filled with your chatter, it may be difficult for him to see the <font color="#FFFFFF">'Your
language skills have improved!'</font> message, as it will rapidly scroll by. He
may want to turn off group messages (in the Options &gt; Chat Filter menu), and
even if he does, he will still learn the language.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Once he notices that no more <font color="#FFFFFF">'Your
language skills have improved!'</font> messages have appeared in a while, that
means that you have probably taught him the language as best as you can. But if
he goes to his skills list, the language will NOT appear there yet, and he will
still not be able to understand the language any better! Before this can happen,
he has to cross a zone border. Once he does, the language skills are updated,
and he can see how good he is. If he hasn't yet reached Excellent (or whatever
skill level you are able to teach him to), then repeat the process until he does
reach Excellent.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Once someone knows a language at Bad (around
30) or better, even though it will still come through a little garbled, that
person will begin to see messages that say things like:</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Teramenor says, in Dwarvish,
  'Thib is a tgst lhnuuage mesaage 1.'</font></p>
</blockquote>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">Notice how a couple of the words are still a
little garbled, but generally it comes through pretty clear. (Numbers are never
garbled.)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">How to Learn a Language From
Scratch</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">So what do you do if you want to learn some
obscure language like Elder Dragon, and you only speak it at skill level 1?
Finding someone who is fluent in Elder Dragon can be difficult (they are
exceedingly rare), but it is possible to make YOURSELF fluent in a language,
even if you only start at skill level 1!</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Like we said before, you can teach someone a
language up to 1 skill level higher than you yourself speak it. So this means
that if you speak a language at level 1, you can teach someone who doesn't know
the language up to level 2. Once they zone, they will now speak it at level 2,
and can teach you up to level 3. Once you zone, you now speak it at level 3, and
can teach them up to level 4, and so on and so forth, until you hit 100. This
can take quite a long time, but in the absence of a fluent speaker, it's really
the only way. This can be especially effective for learning several obscure
languages; for example, my friend Caerollil Wildwood and I once taught ourselves
Orcish, Faerie, Combine Tongue, Old Erudian, Gnoll, and Lizardman all at once,
from merely Awful beginnings. Here's how.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We stood at the border of the Desert of
Northern Ro and East Freeport. With one hand on my language hotkey, and the
other on my mouse, I did the following:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Right-clicked on the text box (in windowed
mode).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Left-clicked on the language name, to cycle
to the next language.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. Right-clicked on the language box to get
back to the text box.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. Pounded on the language hotkey for 3
seconds. (I was able to press the hotkey roughly 20 times, which meant 100 lines
of text went to Caerollil, more than enough to guarantee that he'd go up the 2
points of language that I was able to teach him at the moment).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. Repeat until I went through all the
languages that Caerollil wasn't fluent in.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since we were teaching each other 6 languages,
it took about 20 seconds to do this. As soon as I finished, I ran across the
zone border, and Caerollil, seeing me do this, followed. Once we hit the other
side, he did the same five steps to me, and when he was done, went back. We did
this for about 10 minutes, and each went up 20 skill points in all six
languages. Another hour's worth of work, and we got all six languages from skill
1 to skill 100! While this is obviously not the fastest way to learn languages,
like I said before, it is the only way when you don't have a fluent speaker to
teach you. (I don't consider using skill points at your guildmaster to be an
option; skill points are much better spent on other things. Using skill points
to improve languages is, I'll say it again, a complete and utter waste. The only
time you ever want to do this is if you are FORCED to learn a language from
scratch; so you have to go train it at a guild trainer to begin with.)</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">So why does it work this way? Well, if all you
had to do to improve a language was sit there and listen to it, then here's what
would happen:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Person 1 would spam Person 2 until Person 2
hit their max (1 higher than what person 1 is at).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Person 2 can now immediately spam Person 1,
raising Person 1 to two points higher than what Person 1 was at.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. Repeat until done.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is essentially the same as how it works
now, EXCEPT that since Persons 1 and 2 don't have to cross a zone border, they
could max out their language in almost no time at all. They'd each just keep
pounding on their language hotkey for 10 minutes, and it would require
absolutely no effort. Apparently Verant didn't want to make it quite that easy,
which is understandable.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It can be tedious doing it the
&quot;right&quot; way, but keep in mind that only ONE person per server actually
has to do this. After that, they can group with five people and spam them all to
Excellent, and each of those five people can group with five other people and
spam THEM all to excellent, and so on until everyone and their mom speaks the
language.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Known Language List</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Languages are in alphabetical order by their
skill list name. Some languages have different names in the skill list and the
language box. For example, Dark Elvish is listed as &quot;Teir'dal&quot; in the
skill list, but as &quot;Dark Elvish&quot; in the language box. Names in
brackets [like this] indicate the language box name, where it is different from
the skill list name. Names in parentheses (like this) are merely something to
take note of. The information after the dash is where or who the language can be
learned from (if we know -- if you know, and we don't, tell us!).</font>
