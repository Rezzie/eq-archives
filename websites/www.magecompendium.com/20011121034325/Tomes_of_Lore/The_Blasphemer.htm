Forbidden Circle : The Blasphemer</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Long ago in the time of Emperor
Ganak, Scholar Dag did walk with the Great Master Atrebe. After the unfortunate
dusting of Atrebe did Dag begin his Study of the forbidden circles, Wizardry,
Enchantry and Magic. It was soon that he took a liking to the ways of Wizardry.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">His studies were kept to himself
as he ignored the laws of Kotiz. He became the Blasphemer of the Brood. Most of
his studies were held in private, only his Sarnak slave named Kly was allowed to
assist in his blasphemous studies. His secret was soon to be revealed to all.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dag was commissioned by Klum
Machata to create a magical dagger for his personal use. It was to only be
wielded by one of his ilk. Dag traveled to Kum’s outpost to begin his work.
His slave went along, pulling behind him a special forge which belonged to
Haggle Baron Dalnir.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">While Dag was away the Brood
stumbled upon his journal and his secret obsession. The Brood sent word to Kum
to have Dag deconstructed.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dag was in the final stage of
enchantments, Kum let him proceed and when the dagger was complete, Kum shackled
Dag and used the dagger upon the belly of Dag, the Blasphemer.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Dagger was found to be very
effective, but lacked a few more spells and so it was returned to the Brood. It
never made it back. The Crusaders sent, as well as the Sarnak slave who was
pulling the Dalnir Forge, all vanished without a trace. Only the Dalnir Forge
remained.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Surely the gods cursed the blade
by the hands of the Blasphemer. To avoid the wrath of the gods, all of Dag’s
property and creations were burned as was the memory of his blasphemous studies.</font></p>
