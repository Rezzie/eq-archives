<P><B>What it is:</B> Compiled by Sage Xalmat this spreadsheet will compare for you all offensive Magician spells from level 1 to level 65.</P>

<P><B>Update History</B>

<P>v0.2 (March 12, 2003) - Added damage focus effects. Code is VERY sloppy and I like it that way, so don't mess with it</P>

<P>v0.8 (March 12, 2003) - Added cast time and mana preserve focus effects. Added Specialization and SCM. Also cleaned up some of the code</P>

<P>v1.0 (March 31, 2003) - Added Spell Casting Fury. Added a separate tab for Adjusted and Non-Adjusted stats. Adjusted stats account for average values of focus items and Spell Casting Fury. Non-Adjusted shows theoretical maximums. Adjusted stats also account for a (tested) 20% resist rate on rains</P>

<P>v1.01 (April 2, 2003) - Minor formatting change. Copied the header from the top of the table to the bottom.</P>

<P>v1.1 (April 7, 2003) - Based on recent and updated research, the values for Spell Casting Mastery are changed from "2.5%, 7.5%, and 15%" to "2.5%, 5%, and 10%"</P>

<P>v1.11 (April 14, 2003) - Changed the average value of adjusted Damage and Mana focus items to be more precise.</P>

<P>v1.5 (April 15, 2003) - At last! Separate entries for Magic and Fire based focus items. Also included Magi'Kot's Gloves of Convergence, Riziona's Call of Flame, Blessing of Reverence, and potion focus effects.</P>

<P>v1.55 (June 25, 2003) - Fixed a few bugs, don't remember which ones.</P>

<P>v1.60 (August 1, 2003) - Added Elemental Gloves of the Prime effect to Sun Vortex.</P>

<P>v1.70 (October 3, 2003) - Fixed the bug with spell haste. Rizlona's and Blessing of Reverence should no longer interfere. Also corrected a few minor bugs, and added our LDoN nukes Burning Sand and Wind of the Desert.</P>

<P>v1.80 (January 13, 2004) - Added +% Specialize Evocation and Conjuration, as well as dual specialize Evocation + Conjuration (in response to Secondary Forte, an upcoming GoD AA). Also note the Spreadsheet has a new URL</P>

<P>v2.0 (February 10, 2004) - Added some new focus effects, new AAs, and new spells. Some bugs mysteriously popped up in this version, so bug hunters please track them down!</P>

<P>v2.01 (February 12, 2004) - Minor bug fixes</P>

<P>v2.1 (February 24, 2004) - Based on some research done by magicians, the values for Spell Casting Fury, Fury of Magic, and Fury of Magic Mastery have been altered. Also, added individual values for Evocation and Conjuration Specialization.</P>

<P>v2.2 (March 1, 2004) - Fixed more bugs (elemental gloves namely), and added Echo of the Trusik bard effect</P>

<P>v2.3 (May 9, 2004) - Added Sylvan Fire, which affects both Sun Vortex and Ancient Chaos Vortex. Added a new category called Down Time Damage Per Second, which is directly related to your mana regeneration (also included mana regeneration input)</P> 

<P>v2.35 (May 17, 2004) - Removed Sylvan Fire, due to changes to Taelosian Geomancy.

<P><span class=header2>Guide To Use</SPAN>

<P>Step 1: Click the above link to download it to your computer. Open it in Microsoft Excel.<BR>
<img src="images/ddchartguide/excelwindow.png" width=783 height=552>

<P>Step 2: Decide between Adjusted and Non-Adjusted stats.<BR>
<img src="images/ddchartguide/adjusted-select.png" width=316 height=73><BR>
Adjusted shows mathematical averages to all spells. If you're comparing the efficiency of several spells, or a single spell over time, you want Adjusted.<BR>
<img src="images/ddchartguide/non-adjusted-select.png" width=302 height=69><BR>
Non-Adjusted shows mathematical maximums, including maximum damage done by criticals. Use this if you are only interested in maximum possible damage.

<P>Step 3: Select your conditions. Choose your level, primary specialization, level for spell casting mastery, and level for spell casting fury.<BR>
<img src="images/ddchartguide/firstpick.png" width=561 height=206>

<P>Step 4: Select your worn focus effects, including Fire DD Focus, Magic DD focus, Mana Preservation, and Spell Haste.<BR>
<img src="images/ddchartguide/secondpick.png" width=562 height=227>

<P>Step 5: Select "Extra" effects, like percent specialization, ornate gloves, etc. They should be self explanatory.<BR>
<img src="images/ddchartguide/thirdpick.png" width=330 height=150>

<P>Step 6: Scroll down to the desired nuke and view the results.<BR>

<P>Explanation of Terms:

<UL>
<LI><B>Level</B> - Level you can scribe the spell
<LI><B>Name</B> - Name of the Spell
<LI><B>Type</B> - Type of spell. Different spells have different effects, and should be used carefully
<LI><B>Resist</B> - Resist check on the spell
<LI><B>Damage</B> - Damage done by the spell, depending on focus effects, spell casting fury, and whether you are using adjusted or non-adjusted. Adjusted shows mathematical averages, Non-Adjusted shows maximum.
<LI><B>Mana</B> - Mana cost of the spell, depending on focus effects, specialization, spell casting mastery, and whether you are using adjusted or non-adjusted. Adjusted shows mathematical averages, Non-Adjusted shows maximum.
<LI><B>Cast Time</B> - Cast time of the spell, including focus effects.
<LI><B>DPS</B> - Damage Per Second, or simply the damage divided by the cast time. To be more precise, this is the <i>burst</i> DPS figure of a single cast, and not the long term dps of multiple casts.
<LI><B>DPM</B> - Damage Per Mana, or the overall <i>efficiency</i> of your spell. The higher the DPM, the more efficient the nuke.
<LI><B>MPS</B> - Mana Per Second, or how much mana it costs per cast per second. To be more precise, this is the <i>burst</i> MPS figure of a single cast.
<LI><B>SDPS</B> - Sustained Damage Per Second, or the damage divided by the cast time and recast time. This is a long term figure useful for longer fights or multiple casts chained back to back.
<LI><b>SMPS</B> - Sustained Mana Per Second, or the mana cost divided by the cast time and recast time. This is a long term figure useful for longer fights or multiple casts chained back to back.
<LI><B>DTDPS</B> - Down Time Damage Per Second, or damage divided by the quotient of mana cost over mana regeneration. This is a figure of "steady state" long term damage, where mana in equals mana out (also known as OOM state).</UL>
