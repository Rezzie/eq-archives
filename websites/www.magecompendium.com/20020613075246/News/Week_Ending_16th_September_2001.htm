 Your Help is Needed<br>
<br>
Sony Online Entertainment needs your help in locating Gregory Trost. Gregory is a nephew of an SOE employee and his last known location was the 86th floor of Tower Two in the World Trade Center. With the tragic events that took place on September 11, the Trost family is anxious for any information regarding Gregory. If you have any information on Gregory's whereabouts, please visit
<a href="http://www.station.sony.com/" target="_blank"><b><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000"> www.station.sony.com</span></font></b></a> for more information. Although we appreciate any offers of assistance in this matter, please do not petition in game with information. The Guide and GM teams are not set up to handle this situation. Thank you.</font></p>

:&nbsp; Games Domain Interview at ECTS</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Games Domain was lucky
enough to drag both Jeff Butler, Producer of EQ Live and Shadows of Luclin, and
Brad McQuaid, VP of premium games at Sony Online, away from the tussle of the
stand and steal a few moments of their time for some searching questions.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">GD: Can you elaborate on the
inclusion of horses ?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">JB: Effectively, like the spirit
of wolf spell works now. They will increase the PC speed as they run through the
world. Combat, such as it exists right now will not be changed while on
horseback. So players will still be able to cast spells, they'll be able to
fight. Horses will function kind of as a prestige item for players, and also as
increased transportation speed.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">BM: Think of them as an
alternative to traveler's boots, or journeyman's boots. They'll be purchasable,
they'll look different depending on the type of horse you buy and what race you
are. Their speed will vary; obviously the faster the horse you buy, the more it
will cost.&quot;</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Unfortunately,
there are still only 7 coldain quest shawls. The quest text following shawl 7
speaks of more shawls to come. Additionally, there is a quote floating around

10 coldain quest shawls.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Unfortunately,
I've also heard a rumor that the brilliant designer that made the ring and shawl
quests was fired. I also see the shadows of Luclin over the horizon.</font>

you have decided to forego creation of further coldain prayer shawl quests.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">It has been a long
time now since the 7th shawl was added. Could you please confirm that the 8th
shawl is still slated for development? Hoping so, could you estimate when it
might be live? Pre or post Luclin?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Firstly, I assure you the rumors
of my termination have been greatly exaggerated. I'm still here and staying very
busy helping to make Luclin the best expansion it can be.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I regret that I was unable to
complete the implementation of the final quests for the Coldain Shawl before
Luclin production began. It's still my intention to implement the remaining
segments, but my current workload has forced me to postpone its completion. I
hope you'll feel the remaining portion was worth the wait.</font>

such things from my corpse.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Is this

intentional change is the a command line switch to turn off that particular
message display?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, that's a bug. For some reason
the game was sending you a meaningless message when you loot no-drop items. We
think we've got it fixed on Test now and it should be fixed on live servers with
the next patch.</font>

last patch, the Boots of the Vindicator were changed. They were previously a
silver, original non-velious texture, pretty much looking like fine plate. Now,
they seem to be a dull gold/brown color. Any chance we could get these changed
back? One of the reasons that I wanted these boots was for the plain look they
had along with great stats. I miss my old boots!</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We changed the look of a few items
with the last patch. While your preference obviously would be that this
particular item remain as it was, we thought it better that it look a little
more unique. A few other items were cosmetically changed as well.</font>

that it's just as likely that people will prefer the old graphic as it is that

sort of thing.</font>

Yesterday's tragedy leaves us all struggling with a variety of emotions. Some of us are coping with the loss of loved ones. Others are trying to understand a situation that is impossible to understand. We at Sony Online Entertainment want to extend our condolences to those of our players who have lost friends and family. We also would ask that you, our players, join us in prayer for the survivors, and those still missing.<br>

Spell Changes<br>
<br>
- Changed all enchanter mesmerization spells so that they overwrite Screaming Terror<br>
<br>
- Changed Shaman epic effect (Curse of the Spirits) so that it would not conflict with certain Damage over Time spells.<br>
<br>
- The Emissary of Thule Necromancer pet is now immune to fear<br>
<br>
- Beneficial buffs that don't have an ability drain component on them can now be clicked off.<br>
<br>
Miscellaneous Updates<br>
<br>
- The server selection screen now only gives information on whether or not a server is up instead of providing player counts.  In addition, the "count" option on the /who command has been restricted to internal personnel.  Servers on the server selection screen are still ordered from least-populated to most populated in order to assist players in choosing the least populated server.<br>
<br>
- Harla Dar has been repaired (this happened sometime earlier than today, but we wanted you to know).<br>
<br>
- Reactivated broken zone line between Qeynos to the Sewers.  A dead halfling was stuck in the drainpipe and has been removed.<br>
<br>
- Fixed a long-standing bug that was causing Feign Death to fail when several characters were on the NPC's hate list along with the character using Feign Death.  We'd like to extend much thanks to the monk community who helped us track this one down.  Also fixed a problem with the monk's 'Block' skill which inadvertantly was recapped at a lower than normal skill level in recent months.  Kudos to "Faned" of the "Monkly Business" bulletin board who brow-beat Gordon with the facts until he gave in and looked at the code :)<br>
<br>
- As announced earlier this week, the Belt of the Cenobite was made useable by some inappropriate classes/races in the last patch.  This has been corrected.<br>
<br>
- Several quest components in zones with the Trivial Loot Code will now be lootable regardless of level.<br>
<br>
Norrathian News<br>
<br>
Boisterous shouts can be heard across the lands as carriers herald the arrival of the latest volume of their city's newspapers.  Citizens rush to get a copy of these publications to read the featured articles, latest gossip, and community news for their hometowns.<br>

Announcing Test of Tactics III<br>
<br>
Yes you heard right, Test of Tactics will be making its return to the lands of Norrath in October and November. This event will present teams of 18 members in a battle to the death. Only the strong of body and mind will survive and come out of the arena victorious. For more information on the event and sign up for please look on Harpy's Head Tavern at
