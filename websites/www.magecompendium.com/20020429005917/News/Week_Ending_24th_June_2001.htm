gentlemen there.<br>
<br>
My problem: Gloves of Fire (some stats, effect, no drop, mag/wiz) that
*censored* drops in *censored*.<br>
If you put these gloves on HIE or GNM they are awesome looking. The colour is
bright , even neon red. _The_ best looking gloves in the game.<br>
I was so thrilled when I got a pair of these. And I was sorely disappointed when
I put them on. They have a reddish, quite dark brown colour when they are on
Dark elf hands. :(<br>
<br>
Why is this? Why do they look so godly on other races and on dark elf they look
like you had been grovelling in mud a moment ago? Is there any way to get them
look on DEF the same as they look on HIE? Is this a bug or just a bad feature
because of some shading in graphics or such?<br>
<br>
I know, there is a plethora of more important things in the game yes. This one
just happened to affect me much. I was looking forward to them and I have red
dress and those 2 glowing red globes and the neon red fiery gloves would have
been exellent for my outlook. Now it's not so. Please (on my knees) could you
ask quickly about this from the graphics guy? Is there any way to get these
gloves look like they should on Dark Elfs?<br>
<br>
You know the saying (CP 2.0.2.0): Style before everything.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time and keep up the good work there.<br>
<br>
Sincerely<br>

PS. I wouldn't say no if You could give us mages the improved invis too :)]<br>
</font><br>
The answer is a little complicated.<br>
<br>
Each race has a look, a texture, to their armor pieces. When tinting a piece of
armor that tinting is, basically, placed on top of that texture (blended with
it, sorta). So the actual color of the armor after the tinting won't be uniform
for each race that wears it. This is, really, a good thing, adding variety to
the armors that we create. But it also means that there is no way to get a
uniform look across all the races.<br>
<br>
And, well, sorry about the Improved Invisibility thing. You get advantages, and
you get disadvantages. Not having Improved Invisibility is one of the
disadvantages.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Hello all,</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It’s apparent
that as a result of the Fan Faire this weekend in Minneapolis, inaccurate
information regarding our PvP plans for the future were released and/or
misinterpreted.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">That has always
been one of the difficulties of having a real-time interactive discussion where
one doesn’t have the time to think about the precise wording of their answers.
However, what we gain through the interactive forum makes it worth the effort,
even when things appear to come out wrong like they did in the PvP panel this
weekend.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">For the most part,
regarding the information that has since shown up on web sites, it appears that
when it was mentioned that we “discussed” an issue, it was interpreted as
“we are doing this”. The fact is, we discuss a TON of things when we’re
driven to improve one area of the game. If you name it, we’ve probably
discussed it at one time or another. That doesn’t necessarily mean that what
we discussed has either been decided or shot down, just that we’ve given it
some measure of consideration in the past.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, with
that in mind, here’s the quote-by-quote clarification of the story on
Castersrealm (</font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/" target="_blank"><span style="background-color: #000000"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">eq.castersrealm.com</font></b></span></a><font size="2" face="Verdana">)
and RallosZek.net. (</font><a href="http://www.ralloszek.net/" target="_blank"><span style="background-color: #000000"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">www.ralloszek.net</font></b></span></a><font size="2" face="Verdana">).</font></font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">In approximately
  one week, PvP 'rules' will be as on Sullon Zek. In other words, there are no
  rules with respect to PvP. Standard blue server rules apply and sexual/racial
  harassment will not be tolerated. Everything else (training/bind point
  camping/exp killing, etc) will be completely legal. No PvP related petitions
  will be handled by the CS staff. The standard blue server type problems such
  as lost corpses, bugs, lost items, etc will still be handled.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
Sure, we discussed it, much like we discuss anything. As we were putting
together the ruleset for Sullon Zek, someone suggested that we role it out
across Sullon first and see how that goes and role it across the other servers
if it works out. Will it go across the other servers? We don’t know. We’ll
have to see how it goes on Sullon first.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">ShowEQ is
  actively being pursued to be 'fixed'.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: As
actively as “bang for the buck” allows. We really need to do something
revolutionary and complex in our next attempt to address the problem. It’s
just a matter of having enough time to implement and test that. Timeframe?
Mid-term, probably prior to Luclin’s launch.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Classes are
  being re-examined for viability in a PvP environment. Lady Daegarmo
  specifically mentioned rangers as being one of the classes that is woeful in
  PvP.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
…with nothing specific planned and nothing beyond minor tweaks, certainly
nothing class-redefining planned. Regarding rangers there was talk about
improving archery, but that was spoken of with plans to put something out across
all servers rather than just as a PvP-related improvement. The truth is, the
classes are not balanced for one-on-one PvP, no more than they are balanced for
one-on-one PvE (Player versus Environment). If you have to fight as part of a
group to be successful in PvE, you’ll most likely have to do so with PvP. Yes,
this does mean that a solo melee player will be at a disadvantage when meeting
casters, especially those configured for solo play, and yes, that is part of the
plan.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Lady Daegarmo is
  pushing for the return of egg shaped pumice on vendors for approx 200P each.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: Oh
it’s been pushed, but has yet not been taken up by the dev team for
consideration. We’re kind of like the supreme court that way.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">It was noted
  that Harm Touch and Lay Hands are on the same spell function with opposite
  effects so there's no way to give Lay Hands back to paladins on death while
  restricting the same recycle on HT.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: Not
entirely accurate. The reuse time is not tied to the spell effect, not to
mention that each ability is treated as a skill by the game and uses its own
reuse timer. The reason it’s not being done is not a matter of technical
unfeasibility, but rather a specific design decision not to. Both are easy to
exploit. The level to which they can be exploited is acceptable on the PvE
servers and not acceptable on the PvP servers.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Cross teaming is
  coming to an end. Teams (see later notes) will be locked down. There will be
  no ability to crossteam at all. No grouping, guilding, buffing, etc with
  non-team members. This lockdown is probably 60 days out. (I stated that the
  Development team would make an official date on the lock down in which they
  would give a minimal of 30 day notice. I also stated that I doubted you would
  see these changes within the next 2 months.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
Yep, we’re planning on addressing cross-teaming, probably through locking down
the teams. However, the specifics on how this will be done, along with what if
any beneficial abilities will be allowed to cross any lock down is still being
discussed. Opinions are welcome.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">The lockdown
  will entail a guildwipe. All guilds will be deleted and must be reformed.
  There will be extra staff for the first few days after the wipe to assist in
  this endeavour.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: If
we decided to do the most severe lockdown (no cross-guilding), then this would
probably be the case. However something like this won’t be decided until we
decide what kind of lockdown we’ll do.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">It is highly
  likely that common (the language) will be removed from the racewar servers for
  general communication use (i.e., public channels). Training in non-team
  languages will also receive very low caps.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: No.
While this was one of the many thing suggested as part of a panel discussion, it
has only been discussed as one of the many possible options for an “RP
Server”, for lack of a better term, by the development team. The “RP
Server”, by the way, will not be PvP. Those looking for PvP rules similar to
an “RP Server” should look towards Sullon Zek.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Strong
  possibility of adding a long (40 or so hours) quest to change your team.
  Certain classes/races would not be allowed to join certain teams (such as a
  Paladin joining the evil team).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: No.
It was one of the suggestions brought up by players in the panel discussion, and
has not been discussed by the development team. However, I can say with some
certainty that this probably won’t happen.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">TZ likely to be
  changed to a 2 team server (Good vs. Evil). VZ may be changed to a 3 team
  server.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
These were ‘off the cuff’ examples of how a lock down could possibly be
accomplished, rather than an indication of the direction planned. To clarify
further, we previously decided not to implement a 2-team system, and are
considering a 3 team system, by race, due to the percentage breakdown of players
on each team currently.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Rallos will
  always remain coin + 1 item loot. Code for rain spells is currently being
  changed to not effect your pet or your immediate group.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: Yep
and Yep, but no ETA.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Sullon Zek will
  be live within 3 weeks.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
Probably within a week actually baring major problems coming up.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">There's
  discussion about adding a new Guildwar server with no 'teams' but lockdowns
  based on your guild.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
This was previously discussed and ruled out by the development team, as it would
be insufficiently differentiated from the current servers. In other words, most
of everything that would be doable on the “guildwar” server is currently
doable on Rallos, or one of the existing teams for that matter.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">On Sullon, the
  new summon corpse mechanism for good races will be obtained via a quest which
  likely involves PvP/crests of fallen opponents.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
This is accurate. In fact I’ll tell you now that Mages are in line to gain the
ability on Sullon. And no, we won’t roll it out that way on other servers</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I hope this gives
everyone a better idea of what we have planned for the near and mid-terms.
We’ll work to be a little more explicit about what is currently planned or not
planned to avoid misunderstandings in the future.</font>

reasons). And, no, these spells will not work on player characters in PvP
either, for the same technical reasons.</font>

would be a problem to code to work on player characters, we've never needed to
