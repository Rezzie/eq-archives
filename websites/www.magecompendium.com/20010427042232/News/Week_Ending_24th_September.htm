Level 1 Character Purge<br>
<br>
The Level 1 character purge announced several weeks ago will take place on
Wednesday, September 27, 2000, at 7:00am PST (GMT-7). Any level 1 characters
that haven't been played within the previous 30 days will be deleted. If you
wish to keep any level 1 characters that you may have, please log in and play
them between now and 9/27.<br>
<br>
Patch Day<br>
<br>
As a testament to our on-going goal to constantly provide more content for
EverQuest players, today's patch primarily consists of *many* content-additions
to the game.<br>
<br>
New Epic Quests<br>
<br>
We are pleased to announce that we have implemented new &quot;Fiery
Avenger&quot; style quests for every class in the game (including paladins). The
ultimate reward for each quest boasts a custom model with unique particle
effects. We think that you will be pleased.<br>
<br>
Good luck to everyone on your quest.<br>
<br>
Class Issues<br>
<br>
Rangers :<br>
<br>
Last week we completed in-depth testing of melee and defensive skills for all
melee-centric classes. In the course of these tests we determined that the
ranger class was not performing to its intended level, and have made the
following changes:<br>
<br>
- The &quot;Jolt&quot; spell has had its casting time reduced.<br>
- The Skillcap on Dodge and Parry has been increased.<br>
<br>
Monks :<br>
<br>
High-level monks can now carry increased weight without penalty. The additional
allowance is granted at levels 55 and 60.<br>
<br>
Cleric :<br>
<br>
Celestial Elixir was failing due to multi-tick cure components that are
incompatible with that configuration. We have therefore removed the cure
components and increased the healing provided by this spell.<br>
<br>
After a great deal of consideration, we have concluded that the Mark of Karn
spell is imbalanced and requires correction. This spell's current function makes
melee classes without dual-wield far less desirable members of the group. As
such, the spell has had its duration decreased, its recast-time increased, and
its &quot;heal per hit&quot; value decreased.<br>
<br>
Fungal Regrowth<br>
<br>
&quot;Fungal Regrowth&quot; is now a self-only spell. It was being used as an
offensive spell by virtue of its &quot;snare&quot; effect upon the target.
Furthermore, we ruled out making it &quot;group only&quot; as with other spells
that have this issue, due to a class-balance concern. The spell was reducing the
group's desire for classes capable of casting regenerative magic.<br>
<br>
Attack Speed Buffs<br>
<br>
In this patch we corrected a bug that would cause any &quot;Haste&quot; item
combined with any &quot;Haste&quot; spell to automatically yield maximum haste,
regardless of the level of &quot;Haste&quot; granted by each individual
component. This fix increases the usefulness of better &quot;Haste&quot;
equipment and spells. The downside to this is that those who usually have both
items and spells active will see a reduced attack-speed unless outfitted with
the best equipment and spells.<br>
<br>
High-Level Dungeon Balancing<br>
<br>
Veehshan's Peak and Sebilis have received loot adjustments in order to address
disparities in risk and reward. For the most part, the quality of the
&quot;common&quot; loot in Veeshan's Peak is at least as good as the &quot;rares&quot;
from Sebilis.<br>
<br>
Low-Delay Weapons and Damage Bonus Changes<br>
<br>
In accordance with our announcement several weeks ago, two low-delay weapons can
now only be equipped in the off-hand. Included in this change are the
Mosscovered Twig and the Barbed Scale Whip. The delay on these weapons and the
associated damage bonus to weapons in the primary hand made these weapons much
too powerful for their availability and the risk associated with their
acquisition.<br>
<br>
In addition, two-handed weapons have had their damage-bonus modified. The
damage-bonus for low-delay two-handed weapons (27 or below) created a problem
similar to the weapons above and has been reduced. The damage-bonus has not
changed for normal-delay (28-39) two-handed weapons. The damage bonus for
high-delay two-handed weapons (40+) has been increased.<br>
<br>
Server Selection Screen<br>
<br>
It has come to our attention that new players often think that the
high-population servers are better, based upon the logic that if everyone else
is there, it must be a good server. However, in Massively-Multiplayer games,
less populated servers are often considered superior for gameplay. Therefore we
have marked servers that would benefit from new characters as preferred servers,
listing them in &quot;green&quot; in the server selection window. The preferred
servers have populations such that an influx of new people would benefit the
server rather than cause overpopulation.<br>
<br>
Custom Emotes and AFK<br>
<br>
Animations with custom emotes have been implemented. Current canned emotes such
as /point allow a target other than the current target to be specified. That
will continue to work. So if you type &quot;/point Baobob&quot;, the usual text
will come up. However, you can add custom text to the emote, but you must
specify the target as &quot;say&quot; as the target. For instance:<br>
<br>
/point say points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill it.<br>
<br>
...your character will execute the /point animation, and the text output will
be: &quot;CharacterName points at a gnoll, indicating that he is ready to kill
it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Finally, you can now set a custom message for when you are /AFK. Type &quot;/AFK
<MESSAGE>
&quot; (without the brackets) to set your custom AFK message. For instance, if
you type &quot;/afk Grabbing a snack&quot;, you will reply with &quot;Grabbing a
snack&quot; when someone sends you a /tell.<br>
<br>
Skill Gain<br>
<br>
The skill-gain rate of many skills is now further modified by character stats.
This will allow those with natural affinities towards certain skills to improve
at a greater rate.<br>
<br>
Trade Skills Enhanced<br>
<br>
Many of the trade skills in game have received massive enhancements, including
dozens of new craftable items, new fishing and foraging items, and other things
to be discovered once in game.<br>
<br>
In addition, trade-skill specialization has been implemented. Players will be
able to exceed 200 points of skill in ONE of the generally available tradeskills.
This includes:<br>
<br>
- Baking<br>
- Blacksmithing<br>
- Brewing<br>
- Jewelcraft<br>
- Tailoring<br>
- Fletching<br>
- Pottery<br>
<br>
Once above 200 points in one of these skills, no other skill will be able to
exceed 200. Specialization restrictions do not include class or race-specific
trade skills such as Alchemy, Make Poison, and Tinkering. Players with race or
class-specific trade skills will be able to exceed 200 points of skill in that
skill, PLUS any generally available trade skill.<br>
<br>
The enhancement of trade skills is an on-going project. Further enhancements
will be made in the coming weeks.<br>

Most of the time in dungeons the game lags bad enough without having to deal
with more twitching.<br>

I'd have a hard time convincing the guys that yet another level of security is
needed here. Sure, I've accidentally destroyed items while looting, and when
that happened, I turned fast item destroy off. I'd hate to not have the ability
to destroy and item while looting, since that's where the majority of my
destroys take place.</font></p>
