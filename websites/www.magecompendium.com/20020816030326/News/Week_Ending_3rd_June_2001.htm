<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana Ref">*** Patch Addendum ***</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana Ref">This evening we put in another
patch to correct some issues that arose with the patch yesterday. The changes
implemented include some that weren't announced previously:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana Ref">- Resist-debuffs will do 1.5
times their normal value for PvP encounters. In other words, if the spell did
-60MR in PvP before, it does -90MR in PvP now. PvE (combat versus NPCs) remains
unaffected.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana Ref">- Faction-loss for PvP kills
on Vallon and Tallon now only occur against factions within the hometown of the
person killed. In other words, if you kill an Erudite in Erudin, you will only
lose faction with the factions in Erudin, not the factions in Paineel.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana Ref">- Turning in the Tomb of Order
and Discord will have no effect on Vallon and Tallon.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana Ref">- On all PvP servers, only the
person who gets the killing-blow in PvP combat will have looting rights. We
would prefer to implement some sort of &quot;majority damage&quot; logic however
this should solve most of the issues associated with uninvolved players
&quot;ninja-looting&quot; the loser in PvP encounters.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Loot rules in the Warrens: We plan
to continue modifying the special loot rules in the Warrens. We will be
eliminating several ways around the current &quot;Trivial Combat Code&quot; as
well as looking at the problem of &quot;spell twinking&quot; in regards to the
loot rules. We'll have to see how it goes, and see what people think.<br>
<br>
Stonebrunt Mountains: The next &quot;free&quot; zone will be the Stonebrunt
Mountains, which will be located off the Warrens. It will support a level range
roughly equivalent to that in Lake of Ill Omen. We're expecting to release the
zone sometime this summer.<br>
<br>
Dungeon Touchups/Revamps: We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for some
of the dungeons in the world. Our last patch included an updated Runnyeye
complete with new monsters and treasures to be plundered. Next on the list is
Permafrost Keep. Lady Vox has been in the mood to do some redecorating of her
lair, which includes replacing some of her more lackwitted minions. Stay tuned
for more specific information as it is released.<br>
<br>
Big Changes Planned for PvP: We've had a number of meetings lately to plan
changes to the PvP environments in EverQuest. One of the first things planned
for this is to bring up a brand new PvP server with a new rules set on it. This
will allow us to test our changes for everybody without throwing any current
rules sets out the window. The name of this new server and when it will actually
be going up are still to be announced.<br>
<br>
3D Engine Enhancements: One of the first things up is the enhancement of the
engine to support 32bit color with a 24bit z-buffer. This will get rid of the
&quot;moving stair step&quot; visual artifact that you see in distant places
where surfaces meet at odd angles. For the best explanation of this, look at the
blockiness of the river in the Great Divide or the lava river in Skyfire, and
finally look at the emblem at the entrance to Veeshan's Peak while moving off at
a distance. For those with video cards that support a 24bit z-buffer, appearance
will be greatly improved.<br>
<br>
Deity Specific Quests: We're going to continue expanding on some deity-specific
quests that went into game several months ago. We like the idea of these and
have more in the works.<br>
<br>
The History Unfolds: Keep an eye on the Harpy's Head Tavern site. As dynamic
events take place across all of the servers, more information about the history
and the future of the world will be made known.<br>
<br>
Dragons, Ice Dwarves, and Giants: We're going to continue adding more quests and
flavor to these three major Velious factions. Our goal is to continue balancing
out the three paths so that the risk vs. reward is balanced for each one. Be on
the lookout for new mobs and dialogues popping up in each of these races'
territories.<br>
<br>
New NPC Return Policy: Who hasn't accidentally handed a semi valuable item to a
mob and gotten the &quot;Thank You!&quot; message? We are currently working on a
way for mobs to return any non-quest items back to the player who accidentally
gave them to you. More on this will be announced as it develops.<br>
<br>
Class Balance Discussions: Some recent changes have been introduced as a result
of Absor's now infamous Class Discussions. We're continuing to evaluate each
class on an individual basis and will be making changes based on player feedback
as we see fit.<br>
<br>
But That Doesn't Make Sense!: We on the EverQuest Team realize that with all the
factions, plots, and quests in Norrath we end up with a few oversights that just
don't make sense in the overall story of the world. And so, for the sake of
being true to our world, we've decided to keep an eye out specifically for these
things and make changes where necessary. The fact that you now have the option
to quest for your Ghoulbane from a froglok paladin rather than just brutally
murdering the poor chap is just one example of these changes with many more to
come.<br>
<br>
Guildwars: We've noticed a huge lack in player participation of this feature due
to a lot of bugs with it. Our hope is that by fixing these bugs and enhancing
the system a bit more people might be interested in going to war with their
local guilds.</font>

Message about our Guide Program<br>
<br>
Hail citizens of Norrath!<br>
<br>
Hear my words, for I bring news of great importance.<br>
<br>
Today I present to you an adventure, perhaps the greatest the Lands of Norrath have ever offered.  It is a quest of great proportions, and
a journey fraught with danger.  Fear not though my friends, for the spiritual rewards of this journey far outweigh any hardship involved.<br>
<br>
As of now, we are once again gathering an adventuring party to protect and serve the lands of Norrath.  Scribes are lining up even now so that
they may take your application to become a Guide of Norrath.<br>
<br>
We are seeking those strong in character, bright in wit, soft with compassion, and filled with joy.<br>
<br>
If you've ever felt good helping a fellow adventurer retrieve his corpse, or with helping someone when they felt all was lost, then this is truly
the adventure for you.  Or perhaps you feel your sense of humor could bring smiles to the faces of Norrathian citizens.  Maybe your renowned
acting skills might be of help.  If you are kind, compassionate, and helpful, then look no further for the rewarding journey you've sought.<br>
<br>
If you are accepted, I will not mislead you, the journey will be difficult at times.  You can be assured that you will be tried...
and hopefully you will be found true.  In the end though, the citizens of Norrath will benefit from your thoughtful participation, and the
lands of Norrath will continue to become a better place.<br>
<br>
If you feel this is something you must be a part of, then I invite you to point your browser to: http://guideapp.everquest.com<br>
<br>
We ask so little of your time, but the benefits you can bring to Norrath are grand.<br>
<br>
A few things to remember :</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
1) You must have an active EverQuest account in good standing.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
2) You must be 18 years of age, or older.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
3) Your account cannot be shared with any other individual.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
4) You will need good communication skills.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
5) Positive attitudes lead to positive results.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
6) Ability to participate as a part of team is a must.<br>
<br>
Come one, come all... help us to make the lands of Norrath better than they already are... come be a part of the EverQuest Guide
Program!<br>

Important Reminder<br>
<br>
Due to some of the things we are going to be doing, there is a small chance that some corpses might disappear during the patch.  GMs will
have the ability to verify any corpses that are lost.  That means that they can help you get them back if you do indeed lose one.  It is also
important to understand that attempting to scam a GM about a lost corpse could mean banning from EverQuest.<br>
<br>
** IT IS IMPORTANT THAT YOU PETITION TO HAVE A MISSING CORPSE PROBLEM&nbsp;<br>
ADDRESSED WITHIN 5 DAYS OF THE PATCH! **<br>
<br>
We will not be recovering corpses that might be lost after that time. In fact, it would be best for you to petition immediately if you have a
problem.  Don't wait.  If you are worried about a corpse that you were unable to deal with before the patch, then please log in and check on it
right away after the patch.<br>
<br>
So please make certain that you have as many of your corpses cleaned up as possible before the next patch.  We're not expecting a lot of
corpses to disappear, but the fewer lying around, the less chance of them disappearing.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>

Patch Message<br>
<br>
Zone Changes<br>
<br>
- Runnyeye has been changed.  Something is up in Goblin land...<br>
<br>
Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes<br>
<br>
- We've been fixing holes in the spell stacking code.  For the most part the changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to
stack that were never intended to stack.<br>
<br>
- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds.<br>
<br>
- Fixed the Spell Scroll for Imbue Amber so that Erudite Clerics of Cazic Thule can scribe it.<br>
<br>
- The casting messages for Necromancer pet summoning spells have been changed to be more appropriate.<br>
<br>
Features and Interface Changes<br>
<br>
- The variable %t will now work with /assist.  So you can use /assist %t if you wish.  Though it should have exactly the same effect as /assist
without the %t.<br>
<br>
- %r returns "corpse" for corpses and "NPC" for targeted NPCs.<br>
<br>
- Sense traps failure message text color has been changed to user color 15 (same as other skill messages).  The success message
was already set to user color 15.<br>
<br>
- Ignore Lists now work the same way that the Friends List does. It has been expanded to 30 names per character per server.  The new
ignore list is stored in the same ini file as the friends list (&lt;character name>_&lt;#>.ini).  The first time a character is created or
loaded after the patch their new ignore list will be a copy of the old ignore list, but will from then on be unique to the character.<br>
<br>
- The Alt key now works in several new situations.  It will now show item names when in the trade window.  Because the trade items of the
local player and the trading partner are so close together, the item names of the trading partner will always show up unless the player
positions their mouse pointer over the local player part of the trade window, which will cause the game to only show the local player's trade&nbsp;<br>
item names.<br>
<br>
- The Alt key will show item names for items in your bank.<br>
<br>
- The Alt key will also pop up names for merchant items and corpse items when you hold it down in merchant mode or loot mode.<br>
<br>
- The Alt key will even pop up names for items in open containers when held down and the mouse cursor is over the open container window (they
don't show up otherwise).<br>
<br>
- The client will now automatically reject a /duel request from any player that is on your /ignore list.  Some players were using this
to annoy players that had ignored them.<br>
<br>
- You also will no longer see /consent messages from people that are on your /ignore list (this was also something people were doing to
annoy people that had ignored them).<br>
<br>
- /who GUILD (and the GUILD must be in caps) will now show you the members of your guild in your zone.  You can also specify a guild name,
such as /who "Irontoe Brigade".<br>
<br>
- /safelock command added.  /safelock will lock the EverQuest interface (mostly just mouse clicks, keyboard commands/movement, and most slash
commands) with the password that you supply to the command.  You must use this command a second time, supplying the same password, to unlock the
interface.  Passwords are NOT case-sensitive.  So to lock your interface, you would type /safelock password.  You would do the same to unlock it.
REMEMBER:  If you forget what password you typed, you will need to reboot your machine.<br>
<br>
Item Changes<br>
<br>
- All the shields in the game that have the Ribcage graphic should now also have the ribcage icon when they are in your inventory.<br>
<br>
- Tinkered Watchman helm should show up now.<br>
<br>
- Ring of Pureblood is now equipable only on your fingers instead of your waist.<br>
<br>
- Grand Master's Leg Wraps and Fists of the Grand Master are now No-Drop. They were intended to be No-Drop when they were created.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
- Peacekeeper Staff and the Bug Collection box are no longer equipable. There are problems that can arise when containers can be equipped, so
we had to disable that for these items.<br>
<br>
- Sewing Kits:  No existing sewing kits are being changed with this patch.  But from now on, kits sold on vendors will be somewhat different.
Large Sewing Kits will have 8 slots.  Deluxe Sewing Kits will have 10 slots and weight slightly more than the Large Sewing Kit.<br>
<br>
- Changed the color of the Kael SK quest armor from a very pretty blue-green to a more appropriate reddish-gray.<br>
<br>
Other Stuff<br>
<br>
- Changed the spelling of Troubador to Troubadour for the 55th level bard title.  :)<br>
<br>
- King Tormax's spawn rate has been adjusted to be more in line with that of his counterparts in Velious.  This is not the sort of thing
that we will usually announce, as spawn times and things of that nature are part of the dynamic content of EverQuest.  We're
announcing this, however, to help avoid some confusion.<br>
