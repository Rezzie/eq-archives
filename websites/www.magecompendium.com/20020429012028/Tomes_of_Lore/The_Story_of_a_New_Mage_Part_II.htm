<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So you made it to level 12 huh.
Probably bored with your surrounding area as well... no fear, here's where we
are going to get you to level 16 in about 4 days of sitting. Kerra Isle, just
outside of Toxxulia Forest is a great area to level and level fast. The kitty
factions here only effect what's on the island so no need to worry about getting
killed on sight anywhere else but here.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Before you zone into Kerra Island
from Toxxyoulia Forest make sure you bind before the zone, trust me, bind before
the zone. Good you are zoned now... there are two Kerran Awrats guarding the
entrance to the little kitty city, there yours. They should con yellow to
black/white to you by now, sometimes blue. What you need to do now is break up
the spawn. I used an earth pet for these, because you need to attack and root
one and then pull your pet off and work on the other, you just want to kill one
now, might take you a few tries. After succeeding in killing one zone. When you
zone back in you will no longer be aggroed and can work on one Awrat at a
time... great experience, also collect all the fish and milk you can, because if
your like me at level 12 you hate</font> <font size="2" face="Verdana">summoning
food and water at the startup of a game day hehe.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When you progress a level I recommend
2 levels try the Mamluks. After splitting the spawn, once you level once here
you will have your own system of kerran slaughter. The rest is history, and if
you can tell me what these damn dolls are for that the Kerrans drop, you will
get a ton please let me know. I've deleted over 80 at least I'm sure.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can stay here and camp it, the
most people I've seen here is four others and I've never seen them they are just
hunting Jojo, don't worry about Jojo for a while. If you bring a friend, I had
an enchanter friend with me who charms the kittys and we watch them fight
betting plate who will win, you will have a ball as both of you level fast make
a little gold and watch the kittys fall.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I cannot express how important it
is to use earth pet on this one, if they run they will bring friends and the
trains here although rare are the toughest I've seen in the game at this level,
but the zone is right there and you will be fine. Do not stop if you fail a few
times you will get a system down and you will be able to do it in your sleep.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Part 3 of a mage life will be here
before you guys reach level 16.Then we are going to have a really good time hehe.</font></p>
