<P><span class=header2>General Abilities - Requires Level 51</span></P>

<P><B>Innate Run Speed</B><BR>
1/1/1<BR>
Increases innate run speed (10% per level) both indoors and outdoors. While marginal use outdoors because of horses, SoW, Jboots, etc, there simply is no comparison when indoors.</P>

<P><B>Innate Regeneration</B><BR>
1/1/1<BR>
Increases base HP regeneration (1 point per level). Stacks with all other regen. This is most ideal for soloing, but has utility elsewhere as well. At Regen3 and level 65, a magician will completely negate the effects of a Rod of Mystical Transvergence while buffless, sitting or standing.</P>

<P><B>Metabolism</B><BR>
1/1/1<BR>
Decreases food consumption. While mages can already summon food and drink in unlimited quantities, sometimes player-made Stat food (such as Misty Thicket Picnics) will be desired. This also significantly decreases the food consumption of horses and drogmors (which inherintly increases food consumption dramatically)</P>

<P><B>First Aid</B><BR>
1/1/1<BR>
Allows you to bind wound higher than normal (10% per level). Most useful for bind wounding other players, however. When self binding, the magician loses several hp/tic and is not meditating.</P>

<P><span class=header2>Archetype Abilities - Requires 6 Points in General, Level 55</span></P>

<P><B>Spell Casting Mastery</B><BR>
2/4/6<BR>
Believed to be a form of permanent mana preservation. Estimates put level 1 at 2.5%, level 2 at 5%, and level 3 at 10% mana preservation. This stacks with mana preservation items and innate specialization.<BR>
<B>GET THIS</B> </P>

<P><B>Spell Casting Fury</B><BR>
2/4/6<BR>
At level 3, provides a 7% chance to do a critical blast (doubles base damage of DD spells). Over time provides a small but significant increase in DPS. Also has substantial utility while soloing. Can be further enhanced with Fury of Magic.</P>

<P><B>Spell Casting Subtlety</B><BR>
2/4/6<BR>
Decreases spell aggro. At level 3 spells have 20% less aggro generated. This allows a mage to "chainnuke" longer than he normally could before gaining undesired aggro.</P>

<P><B>Natural Durability</B><BR>
2/4/6<BR>
Increases base HP by 10% at level 3. No matter how you look at it, more HP is very important, and its something you can never have enough of.</P>

<P><B>Combat Agility</B><BR>
2/4/6<BR>
Increases the chance to completely avoid melee damage by 2, 5, and 10%. Highly useful for the solo mage, and just as useful for the raid mage. Less hits mean less heals, and less hits mean a greater chance of survival. Can be further enhanced with Lightning Reflexes.</P>

<P><B>Mental Clarity</B><BR>
2/4/6<BR>
Increases base mana regen (1 point per level). Agreed that Mental Clarity 1 is worth the points. However Mental Clarity 2 and 3 are consider expensive except in certain utility circumstances. This does not count against the worn Flowing Thought limit. </P>

<P><B>Channeling Focus</B><BR>
2/4/6<BR>
Increases the chance of channeling through spells. Most useful for soloing since a magician should rarely get attacked on raids or groups. Works best in conjunction with Combat Agility and Lightning Reflexes.</P>

<P><B>Combat Stability</B><BR>
2/4/6<BR>
Increases melee damage mitigation 2, 5, and 10%. Most useful for soloing since a magician should rarely get attacked on raids or groups. Works best in conjunction with Combat Agility and Lightning Reflexes. Can be further enhanced by Innate Defenses.</P>

<P><B>Pet Discipline</B><BR>
6<BR>
Allows a magician to execute a /pet hold command, forcing the pet to stop attacking until told to attack. By far one of the magician's most powerful abilities.<BR>
<B>GET THIS</B></P>

<P><B>Mend Companion</B><BR>
5<bR>
Allows magicians to use a Lay-on-Hands type ability on their pets. Most useful for soloing. Reuse time can be cut significantly with Hasted Mending.</P>

<P><B>Elemental Pact</B><BR>
5<BR>
Eliminates the consumption of malachite when summoning pets. Magicians still need malachite to summon pets. Less useful for players who exclusively use Servant of Marr and Rathe's Son, but very useful for users of Ward of Xegony, Monster Summoning IV, and pre-61 pets.</P>

<P><B>Improved Reclaim Energy</B><BR>
3<BR>
Increases the mana reclaimed from pets from 75% of the cost to 95%. While minor, this significantly helps soloers that rely on chain-petting.</P>

<P><B>Quick Summoning</B><BR>
3/6/9<BR>
Reduces cast time on all summons by 10, 25, and 50%. Highly useful for Call of the Hero, as well as chaining pets and summoning items.</P>

<P><B>Planar Power</B><BR>
Level 61-2/Level 62-2/Level 63-2/Level 64-2/Level 65-2<BR>
Increases maximum stat caps by 5 points per level. At level 65 and Planar Power 5, all stats cap at 305 instead of 280. Raising STA from 280 to 305 increases Magician base HP by about 32, and raising INT from 280 to 305 increases Magician Mana by about 162.</P>

<P><B>Innate Enlightenment</B><BR>
Level 61-3/Level 62-3/Level 63-3/Level 64-3/Level 65-3<BR>
Increases the INT and WIS cap by 10 points per level. At 65 with Innate Enlightment 5, INT caps at 330 instead of 280. With Planar Power 5, INT caps at 355. Raising INT from 280 to 330, or 305 to 355 increases Magician Mana by about 325. With both PP5 and IE5, raising INT from 280 to 355 raises mana about 487 points.</P>

<P><B>Suspend Minion</B><BR>
Level 62-5/Level 64-3<BR>
Allows a magician to suspend their summoned pet and bring it back later. Level 1 only allows saving of current pet HP. Level 2 saves pet HP, buffs, and equipment. Highly useful in any circumstance (such as preserving your pet for resurrection or going invisible), and also acts as an alternative (but imperfect) form of Pet Discipline.<BR>
<B>GET THIS</B></P>

<P><B>Fury of Magic</B><BR>
Level 61-3/Level 63-6/Level 65-9<BR>

Further increases the chance for a critical blast. Estimates put the percent chance of Fury of Magic 3 at 14% for magicians.</P>

<P><B>Hasted Mending</B><BR>
Level 63-2/Level 64-2/Level 65-2<BR>
Requires Mend Companion<BR>
Decreases the reuse time on Mend Companion by 25% per rank. At level 3, Mend Companion can be reused every 9 minutes.</P>

Level 61-3/Level 62-3/Level 63-3/Level 64-3/Level 65-3<BR>

Further increases the chance to completely avoid melee damage.</P>

<P><B>Servant of Ro</B><BR>
Level 61-3/Level 63-3/Level 65-3<BR>
Summons a spell casting drake to fight alongside the magician for 45, 70, and 90 seconds depending on rank. This drake casts a low-resist 150 point DD every 3 seconds, maxing out at 50 dps for the duration of the drake. Basically a mana free single target nuke/dot every 9 minutes.</P>

<P><B>Host of the Elements</B><BR>
Level 63-5/Level 64-4/Level 65-3<BR>
Allows a magician to call forth 5, 7, and 9 miniature elementals per level, each lasting 30 seconds. Highly useful when soloing, but risky when grouping and raiding when the push on a monster is critical to control. Each mini elemental maxes out at ~25dps for the duration of the fight.</P>

<P><B>Innate Defense</B><BR>
Level 61-3/Level 62-3/Level 63-3/Level 64-3/Level 65-3<BR>

<P><B>Pet Affinity</B><BR>
Level 65<BR>
20<BR>
Allows group spells to land on your pet. For the raiding mage, this is a <I>HUGE</I> ability, especially against AE mobs. In conjunction with mass group buffs and group heals landing on your pet, pet survivability skyrockets in many cases. Furthermore, bard songs and normal group spells landing on your pet improves pet offense and defense.</P>

<P><B>Fury of Magic Mastery</B><BR>
Level 65<BR>
4/8/12<BR>
Requires Fury of Magic 3<BR>
Further increases the chance to crit by an estimated 2% per rank, raising it to an estimated 20% chance at level 3.</P>

<P><B>Swift Journey</B><BR>
Level 61<BR>
5/10<BR>
Requires Innate Run Speed 3<BR>
Increases run speed by 10% per rank. At level 2 of this ability, run speed is 50% above base, faster than Jboots and only 5% slower than Spirit of Wolf.</P>

<P><B>Shared Health</B><BR>
Level 65<BR>
3/6/9/12/15<BR>
Allows pet to /shield you for 12 seconds per rank. While it won't dramatically boost magician defense, it will help increase the chances of survival should a mob turn on you in a tight situation.</P>

<P>Run 3 and Regen 3 every mage should have. Run because you can't always rely on having run speed spells (especially indoors), and regen to help with taking damage, as well as midigating mod rod damage. Spell Casting Mastery is a godly AA by itself, reducing ALL spell mana cost by 10%, effectively giving you over 10% more mana than before (even stacks with mana preservation and specialization). Pet Discipline is THE ability for all mages to get, not only making it significantly easier to pull while soloing, but also to help control pet aggro by an infinitely higher margin. Suspended Minion is the utility spell to get, allowing you to suspend a pet and go invisible, or to summon a backup pet for those dangerous adventures.</P>

<P>Spell Casting Fury, Fury of Magic, and Fury of Magic Mastery work to improve your long term damage, as well as randomly providing free burst damage when it is most needed (boss fights). Spell Casting Subtlety reduces your overall aggro, allowing you to nuke <I>significantly</I> more often without drawing aggro. Servant of Ro works out to be a mana-free DoT/DD every 9 minutes, while Host of the Elements is a nice fun AA to interrupt the hell out of casters while doing damage. Like Spell Casting Fury, Elemental Fury and Elemental Alacrity increase long term pet DPS thru flurries and critical hits.</p>

<P>See above for Spell Casting Subtlety. No matter how you look at it, HPs are king to survival. The number one cause of death is running out of HP. :) Natural Durability increases your unbuffed HP by 10%, helping improve survival rates dramatically. Combat Agility and Lightning Reflexes work to help you avoid damage altogether, and with Channeling Focus 3 dramatically improves your ability to channel spells while getting attacked. Likewise, Elemental Durability and Elemental Agility work to improve your pet's HP and damage avoidance. Combat Stability and Innate Defenses help you midigate incoming damage, which can come in handy one day. Shared Health will let your pet take some of the incoming damage, potentially saving you in a life-or-death situation.</P>

<LI>Elemental Pact - 5</OL>

<P>Pet Discipline and Suspended Minion are part of my holy trinity of AAs. Mend Companion is a nice emergency heal for 2146 HP at level 65, and after Hasted Mend 3 the reuse timer is reduced to 9 minutes, enough to go off quite frequently. Quick Summoning is very useful if you like to chain pets as well as summoning pet toys in little or no time. Elemental Pact helps you save significant bag space by eliminating the reagent cost (You still need at least one at all times). Elemental Durability and Stability work to improve pet HP and damage avoidance, boosting survivability in a tank role.
