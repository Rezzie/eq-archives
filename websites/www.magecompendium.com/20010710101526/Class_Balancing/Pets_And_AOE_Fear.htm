<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pets are unwanted against any
enemy that can cast an area of effect fear spell (and those are some of the more
important encounters, at least emotionally), because the pet will always flee,
and will often run directly into other monsters that the party does not want to
engage. It might be nice to give magicians the ability to make their pets immune
to fear for short periods of time. It could be debated about letting them make
other pets immune to fear. And it will most certainly be expected by the players
that immunity to fear would make sense for necromancer pets than mage pets.</font></p>
