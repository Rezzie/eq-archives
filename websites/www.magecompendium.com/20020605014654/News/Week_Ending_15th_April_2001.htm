Baking and Food Changes<br>
<br>
Now when you right click on a food or drink, it will describe how sustaining that food or drink is. *Note* The message and food values are subject to change over the next week or two as they are being balanced.<br>
Now you can right click on a food or drink item to consume it just like alcohol. Currently consuming food this way only provides half of the sustaining value of the food. There is also a limit as to how much food and drink you can consume at once.<br>
Some player prepared foods and drinks now have statistic modifications. These are once again most likely to change during the next week as they are being balanced.<br>
<br>
Right clicking on the items on your corpse will now auto-inventory them.<br>
<br>
Fixed the visual bracer bug where other people would see a different bracer graphic than you would.  Now everyone (including the wearer) will always see the same bracer texture for you.  The only thing to keep in mind is that if you have two bracers, and each one looks different (one is leather and one is steel, for example), make sure that the one you want to show up graphically all the time is in your right wrist (wrist 2) inventory slot, because this is the one that the game will display by default.<br>
<br>
You can now hail a PC and it will show their name, just like it does when you hail an NPC.<br>
<br>
When destroying an item, it will now show in the requestor the name of the item being deleted.<br>
<br>
Monks now will get a weight bonus of 1 stone per 15 levels up to level 45. In addition, the post 50 weight bonuses have also been increased slightly.</font></p>

There seems to be a lot of complaints about the new Hate and I'm wondering if
you are still working on this zone in order to fix these. Here are some of the
problems I can think of off the top of my head:<br>
<br>
-The pathing on the second floor is horrible.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Mobs on the first floor will heal mobs on the second.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Mobs on the second floor will argo bards singing the mana song on the first
floor occasionally.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- second floor armor drops are very rare.<br>
<br>
Since the first floor mobs heal the second floor ones you are forced to clear
the first floor in order to even attempt the second. This is very time consuming
and leads to about a good 5 to 6 hours of setup time just to reach the second
floor.<br>

Hate. I guess it's best if I just give you the words of the man making the
changes directly.<br>

Quote :<br>
<br>
I have removed the agro text from all upstairs Dark Elven NPCS, and adjusted
awareness range outward a tad. Spam should be minimal now, but you won't know a
NPC is mad at you until it smacks you.<br>
<br>
Innoruuk can now see further, so be careful dancing with him now, he knows a few
new steps.<br>
<br>
Drop rates are meant to be fairly low on an individual basis, but in bulk the
upstairs area yields pretty good loot. The patrolling NPCs have the lowest
chance of loot, and some loot you can only get from the statics.<br>
<br>
There is a core issue with this zone that creates the pathing problems and the
ability to get whacked from above or below, as well as mystery healing.<br>
<br>
The zone is one of our earlier creations, and the software used to create it was
the same we used on all outdoor zones. The problem with that is, NPC collision
detection through walls/floors is non-existent.<br>
<br>
The 'new' area has been there since the zone first came up, but wasn't used due
to the problems listed above.<br>
<br>
With a few new tools to work with, we felt we could make the neglected real
estate usable.<br>
<br>
While I'm not totally satisfied with the pathing/vis issues, I am satisfied that
the area is playable, though it requires a bit different play style than most
Planar raids. I.E., you can't rely on a static camp and pullers there.<br>
<br>

</font><font color="#FFFFFF">Not much more that I can add. The zone is a lot
more interesting than it was before, and a lot better in terms of gameplay. It's
not perfect, that's for sure. Completely rebuilding the zone would help, but not
enough to warrant the effort. Rebuilding the zone would take the same amount of
time that it would take to build new content, and new content would be a better
use of that time since the old one is certainly playable and fun.<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We'll
be adding a new functionality to /assist.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
You will be able to toggle auto-attack on assist from the chat window. The
syntax is /assist on or /assist off. If you toggle it on, then you will
auto-attack when you use /assist. Obviously, toggling it off will prevent
auto-attack from starting when you assist.<br>
<br>
The programmer working on this has read every /assist comment you all have sent
in. The responses were overwhelmingly in favor of using the new system (where
/assist will send target the opponent whether or not the person assisted is
attacking). With the new toggle for auto-attack on assist, we think that the new
method offers a lot more functionality.<br>
<br>
So, once again, we are going to use the new method. As of the next patch /assist
will set your target to the assisted characters target, regardless of whether or
not he is attacking.<br>
<br>
I'm afraid to encourage you to comment on this…<br>
<br>
We're working for the best solution here, and this one has the most
functionality.<br>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're finally starting to get back
on a regular biweekly patch schedule. Here are the things we are currently
working on that you can expect to see over the next few months:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Loot rules in the Warrens: We plan
to continue modifying the special loot rules in the Warrens. We will be
eliminating several ways around the current &quot;Trivial Combat Code&quot; as
well as looking at the problem of &quot;spell twinking&quot; in regards to the
loot rules. We'll have to see how it goes, and see what people think.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Stonebrunt Mountains: The next
&quot;free&quot; zone will be the Stonebrunt Mountains, which will be located
off the Warrens. It will support a level range roughly equivalent to that in
Lake of Ill Omen. We're expecting to release the zone sometime this summer.<br>
<br>
Dungeon Touchups/Revamps: We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for some
of the dungeons in the world. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is
released.<br>
<br>
Big Changes Planned for PvP: We've had a number of meetings lately to plan
changes to the PvP environments in EverQuest. One of the first things planned
for this is to bring up a brand new PvP server with a new rules set on it. This
will allow us to test our changes for everybody without throwing any current
rules sets out the window. The name of this new server and when it will actually
be going up are still to be announced.<br>
<br>
Continued UI Enhancements: A number of things are planned, from allowing people
the ability to buy stacks of items at one time, to improving the way things look
on the screen.<br>
<br>
3D Engine Enhancements: One of the first things up is the enhancement of the
engine to support 32bit color with a 24bit z-buffer. This will get rid of the
&quot;moving stair step&quot; visual artifact that you see in distant places
where surfaces meet at odd angles. For the best explanation of this, look at the
blockiness of the river in the Great Divide or the lava river in Skyfire, and
finally look at the emblem at the entrance to Veeshan's Peak while moving off at
a distance. For those with video cards that support a 24bit z-buffer, appearance
will be greatly improved. Update: This is actually now implemented however is
not yet bug- free. You can take a look at the new capabilities by setting
VideoModeBitsPerPixel=32 in your EQClient.ini. Note: If your card doesn't
support 32 bits per pixel, you will probably crash.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Deity Specific
Quests: We're going to continue expanding on some deity-specific quests that
went into game several months ago. We like the idea of these and have more in
the works.<br>
<br>
The History Unfolds: Keep an eye on the Harpy's Head Tavern site. As dynamic
events take place across all of the servers, more information about the history
and the future of the world will be made known.<br>
<br>
Dragons, Ice Dwarves, and Giants: We're going to continue adding more quests and
flavor to these three major Velious factions. Our goal is to continue balancing
out the three paths so that the risk vs. reward is balanced for each one. Be on
the lookout for new mobs and dialogues popping up in each of these races'
territories.<br>
<br>
New NPC Return Policy: Who hasn't accidentally handed a semi valuable item to a
mob and gotten the &quot;Thank You!&quot; message? We are currently working on a
way for mobs to return any non quest items back to the player who accidentally
gave them to you. More on this will be announced as it develops.<br>
<br>
Class Balance Discussions: Some recent changes have been introduced as a result
of Absor's now infamous Class Discussions. We're continuing to evaluate each
class on an individual basis and will be making changes based on player feedback
as we see fit.<br>
<br>
Velious Magic Resistance: In an effort to further balance the SoV expansion,
we're taking another look at the unnaturally high magic resistance of Velious
mobs. We'll evaluate this on a zone by zone basis and make changes to better
balance out the risk vs. reward in the zones for both melee and caster player
characters.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We'll fire off more updates as we
have information available for release. Until then, enjoy EQ!</font></p>
