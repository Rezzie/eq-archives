the only truth on Norrath is that everything dies. They view the decay of flesh
as a thing of ultimate beauty. The subtle purples of a fresh bruise, the almost
irridescent yellow green of an infested pustule, are but a few of the things
that His followers relish. It is not suprising that many of His followers pursue
the dark art of Necromancy, for to them nothing is more desirable than to be
surrounded by beings who, even in unlife, continue to rot and decay. Do not take
this to mean that His followers are suicidal or seek a quick death. To the
contrary, they wish to live long, painful lives, spreading their dark, diseased
stain across all of Norrath.</font></p>

of few points that all followers of Brell can agree upon. There are many
different factions who all worship Brell. The Runny Eye Clan of Goblins claim he
is their father much to the disgust of the Dwarves of Kaladim who know that the
Dwarves are the true children of Serilis. But the vicious Gnolls of Split Paw
disagree entirely. For was it not Brell who sculpted them out of the sacred Clay
of Cosgrove? Followers of Brell Serilis in one form or another can be found
nearly anywhere you enter the Underfoot of Norrath.</font></p>

strive to have. Mischief in all its forms is encouraged. Practical jokes are
performed as if they are the highest of rituals. Very few of Bristlebane's

does not exist but they are not naïve enough to think that Norrath is that
world. They have passionate loves of people, places and ideas and are more than
willing to fight and die to preserve those things. The dream of every follower
of Erollisi is to die in selfless defense of someone or something they love.

tools for those too ignorant to know what they want or too cowardly to do what
is necessary to obtain it. It is only through the total disdain of your enemies
that you can gain true power over them. Pity and mercy have no power when
confronted with contempt and viciousness. It is the honest belief of the

knowledge of their true selves and strive to help others attain enlightenment.
It is through the sharing of this knowledge that they believe universal peace
can be obtained. If every creature fully understood itself and its neighbors
there would be no need for conflict and war. Followers of Quellious often follow
a nomadic lifestyle, constantly seeking what there is to know and hoping to find
