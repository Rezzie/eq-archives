Vie, Sionachie, Thubr Axebringer, Sir Jevik Isqual, Al`Kabor, Dreezil Pocketdip,
Dagda Icefury, Ognit Eznertob, Dabner Drednever, and Lyirae Oakwynd arrived at
the tiny Elven stronghold in the new lands. Tired from their journey, they
stepped off of the Maiden's Voyage and began to rest for a few moments. Galeth
Veredeth came to greet them as they were resting.<br>
<br>
Galeth Veredeth shouts &quot;Lieutenant Thorn! Please do me the honor of taking
our friends on a tour of the surrounding area&quot;<br>
<br>
The Lieutenant approached the group and began to lead them out of town. As they
were walking along, the Lieutenant made an effort to point out the creatures and
structures to Firiona and her companions. He informed them that the Iksar are an
ancient race. The ruins that lie all about the land show that the Iksar were a
great empire whose influence seemed to stretch the length of the continent. 1900
years ago, the Iksar attempted to attack and take control of Faydwer but the
navy was wiped out by a terrible storm and they were not successful. Something
terrible happened to cause the once great empire to crumble. None of the local
inhabitants of the area seem very friendly with the exception being the Drixies.<br>
<br>
As the party began to walk back, Danak Dhorentath, an Iksar shaman shouted
&quot;Visitors! Watch your backs, the Drolvarg are attacking!&quot; At that
moment, four Drolvarg appeared and ambushed the group. Danak and an Iksar
Initiate joined the group in fighting the Drolvarg. After the Drolvarg were
dead, Danak asked if everyone was alright.<br>
<br>
While Firiona was explaining to Danak that they were seeking out the Ring of
Scale, he seemed generally concerned for their safety. He told them that their
journey would be incredibly long and dangerous. Danak offered a quicker means
for them to get there. He offered the use of his special portal. Within a few
moments, with serpentine speed, Danak Dhorentath grabbed Firiona Vie by the arm.
Taking her by surprise he pulled her into the gate, which disappeared with a
hiss leaving nothing more than the smell of ozone hanging in the air.<br>
<br>
&quot;I must return and tell King Thex the terrible news. Bind the vile Iksar at
once! Dagda, Thubr, Jevik and I will escort the prisoner back to the
mainland!&quot; Galeth Veredeth shouted.<br>
<br>
They escorted the Initiate to the Maiden's Voyage and traveled to Faydwer.</font></span></p>

***Press Release***<br>
<br>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
<br>
LEAGUE OF ANTONICAN BARDS ANNOUNCE NEW MAIL ROUTE<br>
<br>
FIRIONA VIE, Kunark. February 1, 3178--<br>
<br>
Today, the League of Antonican Bards, responsible for maintaining communication
across Norrath announced that they have established a mail route to the newly
discovered continent of Kunark, located across the ocean, south and east of
Antonica. The new route will carry mail from Port Faydwer to the Elven outpost
of Firiona Vie, which will serve as main port-of-entry and battle staging
grounds for adventurers arriving in the new lands.<br>
<br>
The outpost of Firiona Vie was established soon after word reached King Tearis
Thex, King of Felwithe and leader of the Koada`Dal, that his daughter of the
same name had been kidnapped by lizard creatures now known to be named the Iksar.
The King commissioned Galeth Veredeth, once-Lord and High Paladin of Tunare, to
establish the outpost on Kunark and return his daughter to him, lest Veredeth's
life be forfeited for failure. &quot;I cannot allow those vile creatures to keep
my daughter and only heir to the Koada`Dal throne from fulfilling her
destiny,&quot; says King Tearis Thex. &quot;Galeth Veredeth had best not fail
me.&quot;<br>
<br>
A high level source in Neriak confirmed today that the Dark races will not be
outdone in the endeavor to acquire new territory and power. The source said,
&quot;We believe that this nonsense about a kidnapped princess is just that. If
the lesser `Dals and their human and stunted playthings think that they can
wander the new lands unchecked, they are quite mistaken.&quot;<br>
<br>
Many adventures are already beginning the trip to Kunark, a journey that is not
without its perils. A human and halfling party was apparently slaughtered upon
their arrival after mistakenly boarding a Kunark-destined ship in the Oasis of
Marr. They evidently were not aware that the ship would arrive at a new port,
firmly controlled by Neriak and their brutish muscle from Oggok and Grobb.<br>
<br>
Druidic scouts have reported that there are some strange phenomena present
throughout the new lands. &quot;The land appears to have been ravaged by some
viscous magical storms at one time,&quot; said one follower of Karana.
&quot;Some magics that we have come to count on just do not work.&quot; This
phenomenon was apparently noticed to an extreme in the vicinity of a mountain
peak rumored to be inhabited by followers of Veeshan. &quot;Only through divine
intervention did I escape that place with my life.&quot;<br>
<br>
The League of Antonican Bards' representative in Kunark met with Galeth Veredeth,
Governor of the Outpost Firiona Via. &quot;It is my sincerest hope that many
adventures loyal to the King will assist us on our Quest to return the Princess
to her home,&quot; says Veredeth. &quot;Though the dangers in these new lands
are formidable, I have no doubt that many will come, if for nothing else than to
reap the spoils.&quot;<br>
<br>
# # #<br>
<br>
<br>
*Kunark Goes Live*<br>
<br>
In case the announcement from the League of Antonican Bards wasn't to your
liking, we are very pleased to announce that the EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark
expansion has been implemented on the live servers. Adventurers who have
installed the expansion and registered their account key may now visit the new
lands, exceed level 50, create Iksar characters, and access Kunark-related
content in general.<br>
<br>
Here is a short list of some of the new features available to those who have
upgraded:<br>
<br>
- Players may now reach level 60!<br>
- Over two dozen new zones to explore!<br>
- Tons of new quests, items, and spells to complete, acquire, and learn!<br>
- All-new creatures and weapons, with new art too!<br>
<br>
There are two minor issue that is known and that we are still in the process of
rectifying: Action-based sounds for the Iksar and some other Kunark creatures
are still being worked on. In other words, you might hear a giant mosquito
&quot;walk&quot; by you, and your Iksar might sound curiously like a human when
he is hit with a sword. In addition, there is some additional work required with
a couple of the starting Iksar quests. This may cause you to reach a point where
you cannot proceed further in a quest. This will not however cause you to turn
in items and be denied your reward, so feel free to explore these new quests. We
will be finishing them over the next week.<br>
<br>
We would like to offer special thanks everyone who has been patient over the
past couple of weeks while we've readied EverQuest for this awesome event. It
has been quite a challenge for our team to get everything ready for launch, and
your support has been instrumental in this process. We'd also like to thank the
beta test team, who in the face of all of the new content managed to keep their
thoughts between themselves and the Dev Team, while working to make the game
better for everyone.<br>
<br>
If you ordered Kunark on or before 4/19/2000 and do not receive your Kunark CD
by today, we will be posting instructions later today on how to claim the
shipping refund as well as the free month of EverQuest promised last week.<br>
<br>
Thank you,<br>
<br>
The EverQuest Team<br>

<br>
*K-Patch Required*<br>
<br>
All Kunark-enabled players should run the Kunark Patch on the Patch Program
control panel prior to attempting to enter Kunark.<br>
<br>
*Manual Supplement*<br>
<br>
The files named everquest_manual.doc and everquest_manual.txt in your EverQuest
directory are now obsolete. Downloaded to you today are two new files, labeled
EQROKSupplement.doc (MS-Word '97 Format) and EQROKSupplement.txt (Text Only).
These files are supplements to the manual distributed with the retail version of
EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark. For those who upgraded, PDF files of the manual
will be placed on the official EverQuest web-site at www.everquest.com. A new
patch message will announce their availability.<br>

<br>
Greetings everyone !<br>
<br>
This morning's update is one of the final updates necessary for the EverQuest :
The Ruins of Kunark launch scheduled to take place on Monday.<br>
<br>
As part of this update, a new EverQuest Patch Program was sent to your system.
For those who have installed the Ruins of Kunark, this update has added a button
labeled &quot;K-Patch&quot; to the patch program control panel. Within these
patch messages, Ruins of Kunark players may be asked from time to time to press
the &quot;K-Patch&quot; button following the download of the regular patch. This
will allow them to download Kunark-related updates when they are required.<br>
<br>
If you have not installed EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, you will not see a
&quot;K-Patch&quot; button.<br>
<br>
In addition to the Kunark-related changes made today, a bug that lowered the
maximum damage of two-handed weapons that was introduced earlier this week in
the Emergency Update was also corrected. Finally, the art update yesterday
implemented a solution that we've been promising: Male barbarians can now see
their shields.<br>
<br>
We continue to appreciate everyone's patience while we get the servers ready for
Kunark.<br>
<br>
Thank you.<br>

the voices boom from the city of Kelethin in a glorious cheer of celebration,
Lorisyn Oakwynd shouts &quot;Brothers and Sisters of the Forest! Come, join the
rest of your nation on this day. Today, the battle rests, and the Festival of
Faydark's Children shall be held!&quot; Elves begin to emerge from their huts
atop the Tree City of Kelethin, and from the small valley leading into the
Butcherblock Mountains, a small band of dwarves marches into the forest. A mule
pulling a wagon carrying three large<br>
barrels, each the height of an elf and the width of a dwarf, follows closely
behind the dwarves.<br>
<br>
King Tearis Thex, the high Elven king, welcomes everyone to the celebration.<br>
<br>
&quot;During this past year the Mother has shown much generosity and to our
people. The restoration of my daughter and your princess, Firiona Vie, has been
only the crown of the Mother's gifts to us this year. To all of you, I give my
best wishes and though I am your King, it is not necessarily I who has brought
you here today. It is your hearts, your spirits. the very<br>
things that make you of the Fier`Dal and Koada`Dal nations, that have brought
you here. To you, I raise my glass. May your blades prove strong, your bows aim
true, your hearts remain pure and The Mother, may she bless you with every year
being twice as good as the past. To old friends.&quot;<br>
<br>
Firiona Vie, Thubr Axebringer, and Sionachie reunite with their friend from long
ago, Lorisyn Oakwynd. They also receive the wonderful news of the existence of
Lorisyn's twin sister, Lyirae Oakwynd. They all take part in the celebration of
the Faydark.<br>
<br>
The moment the King retired back to Felwithe, a band of villains disrupted the
celebration. Ghargin Bumblok, an ogre shaman, and a troll warrior by the name of
Rogkasth were led by Vahlai Ka`Izal from the Teir`Dal. These villains came to
kill Lorisyn Oakwynd. Once Lorisyn was dead, they warned Firiona Vie that this
was not the last they will see of them. Lyirae, vowed herself to take her
brother's place by traveling with Firiona Vie and the others.<br>
<br>
Firona Vie, Thubr Axebringer, and Sionachie journey by heading to Freeport to
seek out the Erudite wizard and Human paladin.</font></p>

Kunark will receive it in a timely fashion. We sincerely apologize for this
unanticipated problem. We expect that roughly 80% of the people who ordered will
be receiving their orders by Monday.<br>
<br>
Because of the problems we have had we will be refunding anyone who ordered
Ruins of Kunark on or before Wednesday April 19th and does not receive their
orders by Monday April 24th for their shipping costs, as well as crediting their
accounts for one month of gameplay. This applies to International orders as
well. We'll be taking care of these refunds via email at an email&nbsp; address
that we will set up on Monday, and it will be necessary for anyone that wants to
take advantage of this refund to email the address that we will be giving with
some specific information.<br>
<br>
We are very sorry for the problems that have come up.<br>
<br>
Kunark will still be launching on Monday April 24th. We're also working hard on
bringing up 2 additional servers that will be &quot;split&quot; servers. We'll
announce more details on this in the next few days, and we are hopeful of having
those up by Monday as well.</font></p>

placed after today we won't be able to guarantee with the holidays coming up.
Any orders placed before today *should* arrive depending of course on the
country (we have a lot less control over the International stuff). We're bumping
up the priority of any orders we don't feel would make it in time in any case
that we are able. If you don't have it by Monday, we'll be giving a free month
of EverQuest, as long as it was ordered in a reasonable amount of time (i.e.
someone in Taiwan that ordered it today shouldn't expect to get it by Monday).</font></p>

to some unfortunate problems we have encountered with the order processing
software we are using people may experience delays in receiving Ruins of Kunark.
It is still our goal to ship every order that was placed before yesterday by
Monday April 24th. Due to these problems there may be people that do not receive
the disk on time. We DO NOT expect this to affect very many people. As of today,
we have shipped out most of the orders we have received. Anyone that does not
receive the disk on time will be getting a free month of EverQuest to compensate
for this fact. Again, most people should receive it by the 24th. There will be
certain restrictions to this based on when the order was placed. We will
announce more information in the next few days.<br>
<br>
We sincerely apologize for the problems we have encountered. We realize that our
customers deserve to have the best possible service and we are working
diligently to insure that you receive your disks on time.<br>

on the subject, I was able to obtain the name of the GM that made the comments.
It does appear now that the comments were in-fact made and I'd like to extend my
apology to JC-Smith and EQLizer for my abrupt comments on the matter. It is
apparent that JC-Smith's first email inquiries on the matter were overlooked
among the many others we've received in regards to shipping. I've provided JC-Smith
with my email address to increase our ability to respond to issues such as this
in the future before they grow to these proportions.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I would like to stress that the GM involved is
new to our company and is still becoming familiar with the way we operate our
business. He evidently misunderstood the situation and his comments on it were
mistaken. The problems associated with shipping the product late last week
definitely were not planned, nor do we consider them acceptable as attested to
by our CEO John Smedley in his several posts on the subject.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As mentioned by John, we continue to apologize
for the problems associated with shipping the expansion upgrade pack, and are
committed correcting the situation in the eyes of our customers.</font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;The GM informed him that
Verant would be staggering shipments of Kunark. He told him that they were
worried about the initial burst of players to Kunark and that as a result they
would be limiting the amount of copies of the game initially.&quot;</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is completely false and I'll go so far as
to say that this didn't happen. It is so far removed from the truth that I'm not
willing to accept that anyone employed by Verant could have made a statement to
this effect. I would caution everyone reading this to take note when someone
speaks of information obtained by &quot;a friend&quot; and provided by an
unnamed GM. Let's face it, nearly everyone logs anything told to them by a GM in
game, and has no problem naming names in public when they feel that a real
injustice has been committed.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The articles assertion that we somehow
purposely engineered the admittedly unacceptable problems with shipping is
unfathomable. We have measures in place on our side (including some impressive
new code that has been in for over a month now) that should reduce or eliminate
any concerns over zone-crashes due to over-population.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now that that is out of the way, there are
several posts here on the board by John Smedley that give the most up-to-date
information that we have in regards to the shipping issues. We are committed to
doing right by our cusotmers in this matter, and hope that you'll hang in there
while we get everything sorted out. Running EverQuest has been an unending
stream of &quot;firsts&quot; in the gaming world, and we'll learn from these
issues as well.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">About 4 days ago I was in a party
in Sol B, doing the Efreeti Djarn. I was listening to players in the room talk
that I had never met before and their topic of discussion was the soon to be
released Kunark. They were talking about how they are going to Kunark as soon as
it comes up to get all the nice items its sure to have... their urgency was for
one reason only... they figured that Verant would make mistakes (as usual) and
put in some items that were sure to be removed once the players but them to good
use. They wanted these items before they were removed (Much like the Manastones
and Rubicite of past days).</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">This discussion really opened
my eyes towards the nerfing of items that you Verant make happen. If you are play testing
these items in house, perhaps you need a more intelligent test group. If you are
not testing them at all, that is unacceptable. If you are allowing players to
test these items out, then you are choosing the wrong ones. Get someone with
some brains in there that will push these items to the extreme before you
release them! Give these items to one or two players on each server, let them
test it for you with the understanding that the item will be taken away at the
end of the testing phase.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I am very disheartened every
time you change an item or a spell that I didn't have the chance to sit on my
ass for hour after hour to obtain. It sucks immensely when you do this to the
game, because in effect, you are rewarding the power gamers for their work, vs.
the role players you supposedly designed the game for!</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Please, please tell me, that
you have play tested Kunark to the extreme and no items will be nerfed or
removed, so that those souls that choose to move at a much slower pace, will not
see the dangled carrots move further and further out of our reach. I sit here
awaiting your answer, knowing deep in my heart, I already know the truth.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One thing to keep in mind is that we certainly
don't enter into situations where we have to do this knowingly. It's a decision
that's made after we've had time to evaluate items/skills/spells etc., and have
discovered some detrimental affect to gameplay or the pace of the game. So I
can't promise you that it won't happen.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">However... Most of the items we've had to
change or replace post-production were created when EQ was relatively new. At
that time we were still learning the way that different things could be used to
an advantage beyond what was intended. After running EQ for over a year now, we
have a much better idea about how all of this works, and as such situations such
as these should be much more infrequent than they were before.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The only other thing we have to worry about is
typos. Hopefully we can catch any typos soon enough that replacing the existing
items retroactively won't be taken as a &quot;nerf&quot;.</font>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello
all,</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've noticed that quite a few people are upset
about the quality of some of the Plane of Sky items that have been found so far.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Part of the problem is due to the fact that the
most powerful items still have yet to be acquired. Once you start seeing these
items come out of the plane, you will understand what I meant when I said
&quot;There are items in the Plane of Sky that make other planar items look like
rusty weapons&quot;.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The other part of the problem is that some of
the items that have been found so far are indeed underpowered. Since we were
entering uncharted territory with many of our ideas for these items, we erred on
the side of making them underpowered, thus avoiding the problems that occur
should we have to downgrade them later. That said, while some of the items that
have been found so far are appropriately powered, many are not.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Though I will not comment on any particular
item at this time, we will be reevaluating the Plane of Sky items in the near
future, probably after the initial excitement from the Kunark release.</font>
