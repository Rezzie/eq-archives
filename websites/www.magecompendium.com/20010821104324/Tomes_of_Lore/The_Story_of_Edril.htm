<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of Carandril's death and
Edril's journey to Antonica</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At the age of 450, Carandril became deathly
ill. The emperor fought death for more then a year before his passing into the
next realm. High elves and wood elves crowded the busy streets of Felwithe for a
full day to witness the funeral procession, and Edril was saddened greatly by
the loss of his mentor and friend. As per elven tradition, when Carandril passed
away a new emperor was chosen by the council and the new emperor, after being
crowned, chose a new head for the imperial army. Edril was awarded estates in
the surrounding imperial lands, a hero's send off, and a large amount of gold
coins for his retirement wealth. Nobody, however, expected Edril ever to lay his
sword to rest. &quot;He has the blood of a hero,&quot; emperor Carandril used to
say, &quot;try as you might, you could never keep Edril from the
adventure.&quot; Thinking there was nothing left for him in the empire of the
elves, Edril gathered what wealth was given to him and set sail for the far-off
human lands of Antonica.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Arriving in the city of Freeport, Edril was
recognized as a wealthy elf only. His name was unknown to these western lands,
but that quickly changed. Edril became almost instantly renowned in the Freeport
area for his fighting prowess, as he helped many of the villages along Lake
Neriuss against the raider Zellain and his band of dark elves. His real fame,
however, came as a desert fighter. Edril held a chief role in defending an
outpost in the Kithicor woods against a large goblin attack, and it was during
this battle that Edril became infatuated by the deserts of Antonica. Whether it
was because they were so foreign to him or whether he loved the danger, Edril
spent most of his remaining time on Antonica wandering it's deserts, from the
eastern desert of Ro all the way to the dead hills in the west and the plains of
Karana. His most noteworthy exploits in these areas included capturing Ragoth
the sand giant and his &quot;dust marauders&quot; in the desert of Ro as well as
flushing out an entire nest of frogloks around lake Rathetear. He soon was
recognized back in Felwithe as a remarkable cataloguer of strange creatures, as
he would write notes about all his adversaries and send them to the imperial
library. As he made his way to Qeynos, he even fell in love with an erudite
female mage named Almaril and they were wed.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of Almaril and Zisstrik the
insane</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For a time in Qeynos Edril forgot about
adventure or Carandril or his home back with the elves. He loved Almaril deeply
and she took him back and forth from Erudin to Antonica, teaching him everything
he wished to know. He was as much interested in her crude but powerful magic as
she was his graceful fighting styles. For the first time in a long time Edril
was satisfied and happy, and to the astonishment of all it seemed that the elven
warrior would actually settle down in Qeynos with his wife forever. But fate
moves unpredictably and Edril was called into service once more.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">An old merchant noble from Freeport, a long
time friend of Edril, sent him a letter detailing the problems he was having
with a band of local trollish thieves. The thieves, however, were not everyday
thugs. Goods from merchant caravans had increasingly been stolen to fund for a
splinter trollish army somewhere in the desert of Ro. The army, whom the kingdom
of Grobb wanted destroyed very much, was lead by an obnoxious would-be-preacher
troll named Zisstrik the insane, who lead his band of trolls on what he called a
&quot;religious crusade.&quot; Edril agreed to help with the problem. The troll
bandits were easily found and easily dispensed with, but more important was what
Edril learned during the hunt. Zisstrik spoke at length, before he was killed,
about the troll dragon-god Trakanon and how the dragon told Zisstrik in his
dreams to steal and kill the local human merchants who &quot;pollute the desert
and the swamps with their presence.&quot; Edril dismissed most of what the troll
said as crazy dribble, but he became increasingly interested in the tale of
Trakanon. In return for the destruction of the splinter army, Edril only wished
in payment that he be allowed to speak with the shamans of Grobb about the great
dragon. The trolls, however bitter and tentative, agreed.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of Edril's research and his
quest for Kunark</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The elven warrior was immediately in love with
the story of the troll heritage. He was fascinated by the idea of dozens of
glorious armies dessimating eachother because of hunger and confusion,
fascinated by the imagery of the far off and blasted land of Kunark, but even
more fascinated by the character of Trakanon, a powerful being once a god to the
trolls and only seen by a single chief. He immediately thought Trakanon was evil
both for what he did to the trolls and because of what Edril knew about all
dragons. The elf silently vowed to make the hunt for Trakanon his final and most
glorious quest. Utilizing ancient trollish texts and learning what he could,
Edril soon had plotted a course to and over Kunark. Almaril protested greatly
and called Edril crazy for trying to carry out such a silly fantasy, but the elf
couldn't resist the pull of perhaps the greatest adventure he would ever have.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Leaving his wife sobbing behind him on the
docksides of Freeport, Edril set sail for several weeks before arriving at what
he hoped was the lost continent of Kunark. Frightened by the horrible site of
the field of bone before them, the crew of Edril's ship told the warrior they
would remain on the coastline until his safe return. Packing what he needed for
a long and arduous journey, Edril made his way alone across the dead fields of
the ancient trollish homeland until he arrived.at the jagged cliffs of
Trakanon's Teeth. What happened next no one knows for sure, as Edril was careful
not even to divulge it to his wife before his death, but it is rumored Edril had
to escape many clever traps and fight through several horrendous challenges
before reaching the throne of the great beast. Even then, he did not kill
Trakanon because what the dragon had to tell him was of far greater importance
then any quest. Herein lies the complete text of Trakanon's prophecy, as Edril
himself never forgot the words of the great beast and later told his wife in
order that the whole of Norrath may read the message:</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of Trakanon's prophecy, excerpt
from &quot;The Book of Edril&quot; by Edril's late wife Almaril</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The great dragon looked on Edril as a father on
his son and smiled widely. &quot;So,&quot; Trakanon spoke in a voice that shook
the very ground, &quot;at last you have come.&quot; Edril, great among the
elves, felt himself begin to tremble as he stared deep into the dragon's fiery
eyes. &quot;You have no reason to fear me, warrior, even though you have come
here to kill me. But I doubt that even you could perform such a task. You see,
child, I was born before the stars were made, before the foundation of this
world was ripped by Veeshan's claw, and before the gods gave birth to the elder
races. I have been and always will be the eternal mystery between life and death
and gods and man.&quot; With that said, Edril bowed his head in awe and somehow
knew the great beast spoke the truth. &quot;And yet,&quot; the dragon continued,
&quot;I am but a watcher. For while I claim this world as my own I am forbidden
by laws forged millenia ago to change it's course. It is the curse of all my
kind: to love a world so much and to have to watch it die. Take heed, warrior,
because Norrath's death is fast approaching.&quot; Edril lifted his head, his
eyes wide in a look of shock and fear. The dragon simply nodded. &quot;Yes,
Edril, Norrath's fate was decided long ago, or so the gods think. But the
visions of your gods are often warped by their own vanity and selfishness, the
future is never set, and the elder races may yet prove them wrong. The gods made
you all as a means to an end in their struggle and as the wars of the elder
races escalate, so shall the gods descend from their planes of existence and
make the whole of Norrath suffer. But there are those among the races untouched
by the taint of immortals whom I have chosen as the saviors of man.&quot;
Trakanon then stabbed deep into the ground with his left claw and ripped the
bottom of his cave dwelling asunder with one powerful stroke of his arm. Edril
looked over the sides of the newly formed chasms and noticed the walls glowing a
bright red. A face began to form from the blackness deep within the cracks, and
Edril could clearly make out the aging face of an old man. The face had sad
eyes, gaunt cheeks, and long silvery hair. &quot;His name is Miragul,&quot; said
the dragon, &quot;a human mage, gifted in all talents of magic and able to bend
the laws of life and death to his will. He exists now as an empty shell,
wandering his tombs filled with powerful magics.&quot; The next face that formed
was that of a troll, but surprisingly it was a noble and proud visage. Scars ran
from both eyes down to the troll's mouth, and the troll's eyes were strong and
unwavering. &quot;He was called Nalikor. He was the troll first to enter my
kingdom and find me. He ended centuries of brutal war, was greatest among his
soldiers, and was able to lead his people from death and starvation to a
powerful kingdom.&quot; The dragon then turned his eyes to Edril. &quot;You,
elf, are my third chosen. You are Edril the warrior, a brilliant soldier and
great hero. Death haunts you at every turn but you are always able to overcome
your obstacles. You are a deadly fighter, a wanderer of Norrath, and a lord
among elves. And now I award you with a much bigger destiny.&quot; Trakanon
spoke deep in a language Edril couldn't understand, and suddenly a small pendant
flashed into existence around Edril's neck. &quot;To Miragul I revealed the
existence of artifacts that would enhance his powers in the arcane arts. To
Nalikor I awarded a flaming sword to enhance his warrior prowess. To you I give
this: a small pendant that will allow you to talk with me always. But it does
much more. My strength is finite, Edril, and already my powers begin to weaken.
Soon either the gods or the elder races will find the means to my destruction,
and when that happens then the final war for Norrath shall be waged. But when I
die, before I leave for the afterlife, I will impart my power to the bearer of
this pendant, and he shall have all the wisdom and the strength of the most
ancient of creatures.&quot; Trakanon then laid his serpent-like head on the
floor of his cave. &quot;That time is fast approaching. Here is my prophecy,
young one. Everything I say now shall soon come to pass. When the wars of the
elder races begin to come to fruition, the gods shall take notice and plan for
their coming into the world. Then, on the third day of the third season, in the
dark of the night on all the continents of the elder races, shall be reborn my
chosen in the bodies of other men, representing all of the three virtues: good,
evil, and the gray neutral between them both. They will arise to the call of a
fourth chosen, great among them, who will collect my gifts unto himself: the
magic enhancements of Miragul, the flaming sword of Nalikor, and your dragon
pendant. The peoples of Norrath will revere this one as Trakanon's chosen, and
he will watch the whole world burn.&quot;</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of Edril's last days</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When he returned home he was changed forever.
With his greatest achievment completed, Edril the warrior, feared of the orcan
clans, slayer of the plague dragon of Akanon, first soldier of the empire, and
desert wanderer of Norrath, hung his sword to rest forever. He lived many happy
years in the arms of Almaril, his wife, and they even gave birth to a son,
something no one thought possible between a erudite and elf. But whether it was
fate's choice to test Edril one last time or because erudites were enough
&quot;non-human&quot; so procreation was near impossible, Edril's son was taken
by disease at an early age. The event crushed the indomitable elf and at the age
of 405 the warrior passed away. &quot;No spear or sword or arrow, fang, claw, or
spell could ever hope of killing the elf known as Edril,&quot; recounted Biddyn
at the funeral of his friend, &quot;but for a father, the death of an only child
is the worst poison the world can give.&quot; The lord of Qeynos thought it best
to send his body back to the elven empire and there gathered a very ecclectic
funeral procession: Merchant friends from Freeport and Qeynos, human lords of
Antonica, almost the entire gnomish population, and even troll shamans from
Grobb to bear witness to the last warrior to ever lay eyes on Trakanon. Some
said the dark elves were also present, spying on the funeral from the shadows
just to make sure Edril had actually lost the battle with death. Dozens of elven
trumpets sounded his passing and his casket was floated over the top of the
Elizerain Lake to sink into it's depths forever, an honor normally reserved only
for the emperors. It is written that even now, at the bottom of the lake in that
same casket, the dragon pendant of Trakanon waits, grasped tightly in Edril's
cold, dead fingers.</font></p>
