<P><u><b>About Plane of Hate</b></u>

<P>Magi P`Tasa is the weilder of the legendary Staff of Elemental Mastery: Earth, for the Magician Epic. He's found in the Plane of Hate.

<P>To get there, you need a <a href=http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=10092>Fuligan Soulstone of Innoruuk</a>, bought in the Cleric guild of Neriak's Third Gate. Second, you need the services of a Level 46 Wizard to cast the spell Alter Plane: Hate, to port you to the Plane of Hate. Finally, you yourself need to be Level 46 to even enter the Plane.</P>

<P><u><b>Pulling/Establishing Camp</b></u>

<P>Use this map as a reference:<BR>
<img src=../images/hate_b_tier1.jpeg>

<P>Magi P`Tasa is a random spawn at location 1 on the map, directly south of the port in. His Placeholder mob is on a 30 minute timer, so if he is not up, you will need to "camp" his spawn.

<P>You will arrive at the Zone In. Immediately you may be confronted with a wanderer near the Zone In, but it does not directly path and will likely not add. Directly north is a single random mob, and directly south across the ramp are 4 random mobs. Past the ramp directly south is Magi P`Tasa's house.

<P>Magi P`Tasa's house has 2 rooms: the East room, and the West room where he spawns. The East room has two mobs: one in the northeast corner by the tables, and one in the southwest corner by the piano. The West room has three mobs: One in the northwest corner, another in the southwest corner, and Magi P`Tasa's placeholder in the southeast corner.

<P>This whole region is soloable by a Level 65 magician, and as such the pull order (to establish camp) should be as follows. Be sure to pull with Annul Magic to strip mobs of their buffs, including Damage Shields:

<P>1. Establish camp at the Zone In.
<P>2. Pull the wanderer that paths near the Zone In, if its near by.
<P>3. Pull the random mob directly to the north of the Zone In.
<P>4. Pull the four mobs on the ramp, one at a time. At 65 they usually come single.
<P>5. Pull the East room of Magi P`Tasa's house. First the northeast mob, then the southwest mob.
<P>6. Move camp to the East room, in the southeast corner. Establish camp there.
<P>7. Pull Magi P`Tasa's spawn in the West room.
<P>8. If you desire, pull the other two mobs in the West room.

<P>At this point you can also run and pull various other mobs to camp to pass the time. Be sure to keep a timer when the first mob in the East room dies. All mobs in this region are on a 30 minute timer, so there should be very little surprise when the spawn.

<P><u><b>Further Details about Magi P`Tasa and Forsaken Revenants</b></u>

<P>Magi P`Tasa does not always spawn; rather his placeholder is a male Forsaken Revenant.

<P>Male Forsaken Revenants are as low as level 46 and as high as 54. They are Magician class, and as such cast various magician spells appropriate to their level. Among their most annoying spells is their damage shield they cast, much like our own. Its important that this damage shield is stripped. Because they are Magician class, they will try to cast spells, and cast spells a lot. Be sure to use an Air pet to interrupt its casting, or have very high magic resists.

<P>Magi P`Tasa himself is a level 55 or 56 Magician. Like Forsaken Revenants, P`Tasa also casts magician spells, including Shock of Swords, Char, and Sirocco, as well as a damage shield. Like the Revenants, he casts a lot, so be sure to use an Air pet to interrupt his casting.
