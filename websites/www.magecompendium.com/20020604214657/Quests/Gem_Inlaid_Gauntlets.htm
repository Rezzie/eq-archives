Umvera Dekash says 'What, Southern ? Do I look like a merchant to you? Just
because all these merchants are in my library, it doesn't mean that I am one. If
you are interested in something other than spell scrolls, then, we can talk.<br>
<br>
You say, 'I am interested in something other than spell scrolls'<br>
<br>
Umvera Dekash says 'Ah, so you do have half a wit about you! Very well. As you
can clearly see, I am the librarian here. I keep track of all of the mystic
tomes that enter this divine building. I also take care of all of the
purchasing. Have you something to offer?<br>
<br>
You say, 'I have something to offer'<br>
<br>
Umvera Dekash says 'Excellent! You have no idea how difficult it is to get good
help these days. Do you think you would have the time to gather some information
for me?<br>
<br>
You say, 'I have the time to gather information for you'<br>
<br>
Umvera Dekash says 'Even better! Well, it has been some time since the Tesch Val
gnolls moved in on the Split Paw. That being said, we still know little to
nothing of their origins. If you can bring me back the four scrolls that our
diviners speak of, I believe I can reward you well.<br>
<br>
Ok now you need to go to Split Paw in the Southern Karana, collect four different
Tanned Split Paw Skin Scrolls. These are lore items, and look like a rolled up
scroll. When you right click you can read the message written on them if you are
fluent in Gnoll. But even those unversed in Gnoll can notice the number on the
page. Collect scroll Volume 1, 2, 3, and 4 and return them to Umvera in North
Qeynos<br>
<br>
Umvera Dekash says 'It's about time. Let's see here. Right.. right.. right. Very
good. Right. There you are! I translated the text. Now the scrolls need to be
bound. Take these scrolls to Jheron Felkis in Freeport. I believe he is staying
in one of the spare rooms in Velith and Bardo's establishment. He will ensure
they are bound correctly. Return to me when the binding is complete.<br>
<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
Jheron Felkis is located in East Freeport in Velith and
Bardo's establishment, 3rd Floor.</font>

<br>
Jheron Felkis says 'Ah, greetings, traveler! Settled into one of these rooms,
have you? Well, this room is mine, so get out! Hey, wait! You aren't here to
deliver a shipment of books to me, are you?<br>
<br>
You say, 'What shipment of books?'<br>
<br>
Jheron Felkis says 'Oh, I typically receive monthly shipments of books from
Umvera Dekash. I hear he has recently been promoted to senior librarian in
Erudin. What a vaulted position! I could only aspire. I'm not going to be
binding books forever, you know!<br>
<DID NOT LOG THIS PART BUT 
GOT A SCREENSHOT OF TEXT>
<br>
Jheron Felkis says &quot;So you are from Umvera! What is this? Oh my! Interesting!
I'll bind them right away! A little snip here..a little snip there.. All done!
That didn't take long, did it? I won't be doing this forever, you know. After
the militia burned down my father's home, he could not afford to send me through
proper schooling. Ah well, such is life!<br>
<br>
You gain experience!!<br>
<br>
Ok at this point you are given a book called A Splitpaw Tome. You can open it up
and read it, 8 pages of text, none of it seemed relevant to any type of monk
quest so I wont bother posting the lore contained within, interesting history of
the Torn Ear though. Now you get to run back to North Qeynos and deliver the
book to Umvera.<br>
<br>
Umvera Dekash says 'You have returned safely. That is wonderful! Where the heck
is my book, child? In my hands, I see. Such a bright little twinkle you are!
Well, let me scribble something down on this pad here. There you are. Take this
note to Durkis Battlemore in the Butcherblock Mountains. He is a remarkable
smith, but more importantly, he owes me for his smithing books.</font>

Durkis Battlemore says 'What have ye got there, lad? Ack. I thought I would
never hear from that crazy old man again. He wants me to give you a pair o' me
gauntlets. I suppose I kin do that. Here you are, Southern . Wear them in good
health.<br>
