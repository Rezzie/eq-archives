meaningful healing potions out there that can be bought from a vendor would
reduce class-interdependence. Yes, as you said, your suggestion is a money sink
that would help all classes solo better, but the truth is that that is a money
sink that we've specifically decided not to take advantage of. We don't allow
people to buy healing, nor do we allow them to buy experience. That's why the
healing potion is basically useless, and it's also the reason why we've adjusted
the experience given out by some quests.</font>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The
two real issues for players with limited time (I'd call it casual gaming but
apparently we can't decide on what that means) have are very simple.</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">1.
Getting items. We do not want items to become more common. We don't want to
diminish the sense of satisfaction one has upon earning an item. We do not feel
that we should get items as readily as people who spend more time online...that
would be silly. We do want to be able to make progress towards getting them.
Camping is the only approach that works in getting high level items (which is
sad and not role playing at all...but obviously that's a separate thread). As a
player with limited time I have about a two hour window to get online. Therefore
camping isn't an option because 1)most good camping areas are taken round the
clock. and 2)If the spot isn't taken, the camp times are so long that there is a
slim to none chance the mob will spawn during this time. Add in the time to get
a group who is willing to camp there, as well as the coordination time and it's
virtually impossible. I would love to be able to sink 30 hours into getting a
level equivalent item for my class, but the game does not allow this to happen
in intervals. It's either a ten hour camp...or nothing. You've even implemented
changes to quests such as Jboots making things No Rent, which accomplishes
little except making the item impossible for a person with limited time to
acquire. There isn't an easy solution to this problem, but it's a problem that
Verant should acknowledge and work toward addressing. But please READ what I'm
saying, not easier, just POSSIBLE. Allow us to earn bits and pieces while we are
on line.</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">2)
Gain XP at higher levels. Hopefully the expansion will go a long way at curing
this, because the problem is really overcrowding. Simply put again I have a two
hour window. I log on at Mistmoore, try for 30 minutes to get a group and fail.
As a cleric there is nothing I can do on my own to gain xp so I'm faced with a
choice. Sit on my butt and hope a group opens up, or cross the continent to Guk
or an equivalent dungeon and try to find a group. This is not an
&quot;enjoyable&quot; use of my two hours, so usually I simply log off, and
sadly its gotten to the point where I don't really log back on anymore. I don't
want to argue the whole soloing issue again, although I firmly believe that
every class should be able to gain some XP while waiting to group. However,
logging on for an hour without accomplishing anything simply due to overcrowding
and an inability to solo is a problem. Again, you need to address the problem,
but LISTEN...we don't want an easier game with, we want it to be easier to
accomplish something in a limited time frame. Reread that, there is a
distinction. It can still be challenging while at least semi profitable in a
limited time frame.</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">To
be honest I cancelled my account about 2 weeks ago and I have no idea why I'm
still posting to this board. The only thing I can figure is that I honestly
loved this game for the 8 or 9 months that I've played. These issues are
important, real issues. Please don't trivialize them or strawman the argument.
Most of us &quot;casual gamers&quot; or people with limited time don't want an
&quot;easier&quot; game, we want a game where we can accomplish the same thing
everyone else can, even if it takes us a lot longer.</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You've
made some very valid points, not the least of which is your statement about
overcrowding being the root to most of the &quot;casual gamer&quot; complaints.
I think that before we can make a lot of progress with a bunch of &quot;what
if&quot; arguments, we really need to get a handle on the crowding issue and get
the expansion out.</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
expansion will add tons of new areas which were created by people who play the
game actively and understand what the players expect as well as what they want.
These zones are in many ways much better than the zones of EQ Proper, and can
hold a larger number of people in each zone without them stepping on each others
toes. In addition to all of this, many of the new areas in the expansion are
geared towards the higher level people who've hit that ceiling and run out of
things to do from their perspective. Imagine how nice the world will be when 90%
of the people above 45 run off to the new land to do something else besides
Lower Guk and Solb :)</font>

well assuming that he's stuck. Usually, after being stuck there long enough
he'll find his way off the rock.<br>

Of course the long term plan is for us to make it so that he doesn't get stuck

that it's possible that some of the new quests might be going overboard on the

in the first place. Perhaps after we run like this for a while, and we can see
the impact of the changes that have been made on old server economies as well as
newer servers (such as Lanys and Luclin), we might reevaluate the prices of some
of the quests.</font>

you ? There are probably hundreds of people who feel the way you do. EQ isn't

after they play 8 hours a day for months, earn a 50th level character, and then
email me about how Verant sucks and the game design behind EQ is horrible, and
then there's the vast majority of players who just keep on playing and having

problems right now is overcrowding, which is the result of waaaay more people
playing EQ than we ever thought would play, especially almost a year after its
launch. Were our policies and decisions negatively affecting even a small but
significant portion of our player base, overcrowding would not be an issue.</font></p>

assure you it is neither my attitude nor the people working for me. With all due
respect, the notion that we only care about the revenue from the initial box
sale and not about the monthly subscription costs is ludicrous at best. If we
cannot keep people subscribing to EverQuest the game will go away. Personally, I
want to keep making these games (MMORPGs) for quite a long time so it's
certainly deeply in my interest that EQ is and remains profitable. And, like I

different item configurations is PART of EQ's gameplay as per design. If we

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">And

it for quite some time. As I mentioned earlier, I used to complain a lot in a
MUD I used to play. I put about 60 days of playing time into my level 50 Ranger
there. After a while I'd question any little change the people who ran that game
made, especially if it affected me or my friends in any way. And though I'd play
the game for hours every night, I'd spend some of that time complaining and
whining.</font>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I think
perhaps this is inevitable in this genre, or at least while this genre is fairly
new. People aren't used to playing a game for MONTHS, investing huge amounts of
time into it. Most single player games you buy, take home, and either you
discover you don't care for it right away and shelf it/return it, or you enjoy
it and play it quite a bit for a few weeks until you complete it. With a MMORPG
you end up investing an order of magnitude more time into it. Couple that with
the fact that these games change and evolve and can be patched and that you have
the opportunity to be heard by the creators of that game, and you end up with a
small, vocal group who is constantly complaining and trying to bring attention
to themselves.</font>

understand completely the personal investment our player base has made and the
passion and attachment they have. I also understand completely that 'familiarity
breeds contempt' and that the more you play a game like this, the more the
little, minor problems that you ignored at first begin to bother you more and
more. I also understand that nobody wants their character's class nerfed, or the
item they worked for hours to obtain changed negatively, even if the change is
for the overall good and balance of the game.</font>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But I
really submit that some of this phenomenon is inescapable due to the nature of
this genre. I'm just hoping that a lot of it is because most people aren't used
to the genre. Of the 189,000 people who play EQ, how many have played a game
like this before? Maybe half of them played UO? Maybe. And before that? Probably
very few (overall, MUDs have never been very popular, probably due to their text
based nature). MMORPGs are sooo different than single player games (and so much
better, IMHO I think they'll take a bit to get used to.</font>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That,
and future MMORPGs will be that much better too! Remember, EQ is part of the
first generation of these games. In my opinion, we've only just scratched the
surface here. EQ, UO, and AC are only the tip of the iceberg. Personally, I'm
very excited to be part of this new and emerging industry, because we've only
just begun.</font>

are trying to do statistical sampling to determine the value of stats, and there

Since stats are a programmatic effect, someone at Verant knows exactly the

there in releasing that information?</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I
haven't heard much from the EverQuest folk about pets and dual wield since the
&quot;quick fix&quot; went into effect several weeks ago to allow mage pets to
dual wield. I have begun to wonder if the problem ever will be addressed
further.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I
for one am not satisfied with the current state of things -- my pets can in fact
dual wield, but only after a considerable time investment for each pet.
Summoning a pair of daggers for my pet increases the time cost for summoning a
pet by at least a factor of 2. Not only is it an annoyance from a player's
standpoint, but it still is inconsistent with the game world, elementals should
not need weapons -- ever -- to improve their fighting effectiveness. It also
greatly reduces the effectiveness of one of my favorite soloing tactics -- the
chain cast. When a pet is near dead, and I summon another to replace it, I don't
have the time to hand off a pair of weapons before sending it into battle.</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Don't
get me wrong, I am glad that the good people at Verant realized their mistake
with npc's and dual wielding and took quick steps to patch it. What bothers me
is that what I once thought was intended as a &quot;quick fix&quot; now appears
to be thought of as a permanent one. I want the development team to know that we
mages and necromancers are not satisfied with this fix as permanent, that it is
effecting our gameplay adversely, and that it is an issue that we strongly
believe needs to be dealt with.</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">If
I am wrong in assuming that the issue has been closed by Verant, please let me
know. If not, I hope to hear that it will be reopened to set things right in the
realms of Norrath.</font>

  <p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;This
  was a code problem from day one. It resulted in Verant beefing up all the mobs
  to account for the fact that dual wield wasn;t working (and they couldn't
  figure it out for themselves). For them to fix it now would require that they
  either beef up all characters or otherwise reduce the power of all mobs. In
  either case, it's more work than they want to do.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rebalancing
the entire game just to fix one bug correctly would yield tons of other bugs,
take a long time, and be painful for everyone. Yes, you have to hand your pet
weapons should you want him to dual wield, and it is a bit at odds with the game
world in general, but after much thought, it was the option that was the least
suseptable to additional problems.</font>
