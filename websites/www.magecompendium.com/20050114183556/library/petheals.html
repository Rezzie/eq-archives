<h2>Or: Why Magicians Need Better Heals for Balance Sake</H2>

<P>First, I'm not a druid, shaman, beastlord. I'm a Magician and part Cleric. I'm not going to argue about healing balance for shamans, druids. I'm going to argue about healing balance for magicians, beastlords, and clerics. Druids and Shamans can fight their fight, while I fight mine.</P>

<P>Before Magician heals (the primary subject of this page) can be discussed, we must first understand the balance between the game's best healers: priests.

<h1>Cleric, Druid, and Shaman Heals</H1>

<P>The common logic between these three classes is that Clerics have the most potent heals, and get them earlier, while druids and shaman get them later. Furthermore, Clerics have a 5% bonus for all spells except their Complete Heal.</P>

<P>For sake of argument, Complete Heal-type spells will be completely ignored, as if they don't exist. Its already been said by devs they are overpowered, and the dev team wishes they were never invented.</P>

<P>First, lets examine the major heals of each class by each major spell circle.</P>

<P>These tables assume a naked character with 0 skills. The 5% bonus for clerics is included where appropriate.

<P><table border=1>
<tr><td>Class</td><td>Level</td><td>Heal Name</td><td>HP</td><td>Mana</td><td>Cast Time</td><td>Efficiency</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cleric</td><td>1</td><td>Minor Healing</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>1.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Druid</td><td>1</td><td>Minor Healing</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>1.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shaman</td><td>1</td><td>Minor Healing</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>1.0</td></tr>
</table>

<P>At this level, Clerics, Druids, and Shaman have identical starting heals. Considering this is just level 1, there really isn't much to say. Also at this lower level, the 5% cleric bonus is too small to kick in at all.</P>

<P><table border=1>
<tr><td>Class</td><td>Level</td><td>Heal Name</td><td>HP</td><td>Mana</td><td>Cast Time</td><td>Efficiency</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cleric</td><td>5</td><td>Light Healing</td><td>27</td><td>25</td><td>2</td><td>1.08</td></tr>
<tr><td>Druid</td><td>5</td><td>Minor Healing</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>1.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shaman</td><td>5</td><td>Minor Healing</td><td>10</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>1.0</td></tr>
</table>

<P>The difference between priests kicks in. This heal is now high enough for the cleric bonus to kick in. Druids and Shamans have to wait for the next spell circle for new heals.

<P><table border=1>
<tr><td>Class</td><td>Level</td><td>Heal Name</td><td>HP</td><td>Mana</td><td>Cast Time</td><td>Efficiency</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cleric</td><td>9</td><td>Light Healing</td><td>29</td><td>25</td><td>2</td><td>1.16</td></tr>
<tr><td>Druid</td><td>9</td><td>Light Healing</td><td>28</td><td>25</td><td>2</td><td>1.12</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shaman</td><td>9</td><td>Light Healing</td><td>28</td><td>25</td><td>2</td><td>1.12</td></tr>
</table>

<P>Druids and Shaman catch up to Clerics, but the 5% bonus keeps the edge on Clerics. This will remain true for most of each class's career.

<P>An interesting note, at level 39, druids and shamans do <I>NOT</I> get their corresponding heal upgrade to match clerics. Also, Clerics <I>DO</I> receive Complete Healing at this level.</P>

<P>Note: Healing Water is a Legacy of Ykesha quested spell, thus it is not widely available. Having said that, its the first time that Druids receive a heal where Shamans do not.

<P>At this level, Clerics receive their first "quick heal", fast cast spells designed for very fast patch healing, but not meant to replace primary heals. Exluding that, Shamans and Druids finally catch up to Clerics in primary heals.</P>

<P>At this level, the gap between Druids and Shamans widens significantly. Clerics retain a minor lead over Druids because of the cast time and +5% bonus.

</table>

<P>At this level of healing, all heals are now 3.75 seconds. The difference between classes is the mana efficiency and the amount healed. The final rank is set: Clerics number one, Druids number two, Shaman number three.</P>

<P>Gates heals are a jump in power over their Planar versions in efficiency and total heals.</P>

<P>The general trend from level 1 to 65: Clerics have the best heals, from not only getting powerful heals earlier, but also the 5% healing bonus. Shamans, because of their slow spells (according to devs) have the weakest heals at higher levels; when mobs are fully slowed, the reduced potency of shaman heals is virtually cancelled out. Druids fall in the middle, because of the "jack of all trades" title, and never exceed clerics in power for healing but staying ahead of shamans.

<P>The thing I want you to get out of this: Because Clerics specialize in heals, they have the most potent. Because Shamans have slow, they have the weakest heals. So, one would argue that slow is so powerful, less heals are needed.</P>

<h1>Enter: The Beastlord</H1>

<P>Unlike the other classes, Beastlords were introduced with the Shadows of Luclin expansion (coincidentally, at the same time as the Vah Shir race. The race/class combo of Vah Shir/Beastlord is by far the most popular combo for this class). They were meant to be a monk/shaman hybrid, but were given gimped melee abilities as a penalty for being a hybrid. Their specialty: Warders, similar in strength to Magician and Necro pets. However, Beastlords also have <I>VERY POWERFUL</I> pet heals, as we will see shortly.

<P>For sake of argument, we shall ignore Beastlord Hybrid healing. Hybrid healing of other players falls significantly behind priests, and is much closer to other hybrid classes. There is no problem with Hybrid healing.</P>

<P>Where the problem lies is their potent pet heals. Remember the argument for shamans: "Because Shamans have slow, they have the weakest heals. So, one would argue that slow is so powerful, less heals are needed." What we see in beastlords is the <I>opposite</I> effect. Beastlord pet heals rival very closely Cleric heals, and quickly <I>exceed</I> their parent-class Shaman, and in addition, because of their ability to slow mobs, their heals are much more potent.</P>

<P>While Priests follow the priest spell circle (1, 5, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29, 34, 39, 44, 49) Beastlords follow the hybrid spell circles (1, 9, 15, 22, 30, 39, 49). As such, we will ignore spell circles where Beastlords do not get new spells.

<P><table border=1>
<tr><td>Class</td><td>Level</td><td>Heal Name</td><td>HP</td><td>Mana</td><td>Cast Time</td><td>Efficiency</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cleric</td><td>9</td><td>Light Healing</td><td>29</td><td>25</td><td>2</td><td>1.16</td></tr>

<tr><td>Shaman</td><td>9</td><td>Light Healing</td><td>28</td><td>25</td><td>2</td><td>1.12</td></tr>
<tr><td>Beastlord</td><td>9</td><td>Sharik's Replenishment</td><td>28</td><td>15</td><td>2</td><td>1.867</td></tr>
</table>

<P>The first thing we see is that Shaman heals and Beastlord pet heals are identical at this level, except for one major detail: Sharik's Replenishment is <I>significantly</I> lower in mana cost. Not only that, its <I>more efficient</I> than even Clerics have. The only advantage Clerics have over Beastlord pet heals is the 5% bonus.</P>

<P><table border=1>
<tr><td>Class</td><td>Level</td><td>Heal Name</td><td>HP</td><td>Mana</td><td>Cast Time</td><td>Efficiency</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cleric</td><td>15</td><td>Healing</td><td>89</td><td>60</td><td>3</td><td>1.483</td></tr>
<tr><td>Druid</td><td>15</td><td>Light Healing</td><td>31</td><td>25</td><td>2</td><td>1.24</td></tr>

<tr><td>Beastlord</td><td>15</td><td>Keshuval's Rejuvenation</td><td>85</td><td>30</td><td>3</td><td>2.83</td></tr>
</table>

<P>At this point, Beastlords pull significantly ahead of their Shaman parent class, and retain this advantage for the rest of their career. Additionally, Beastlord pet heals are almost twice as mana efficient as Cleric heals; again, the only advantage to clerics is the 5% bonus.

<P>The next pet heal upgrade for Beastlords does not come until two spell circles later, at level 30. At level 29, Shamans and Druids gain their advantage over Beastlord heals, and for 6 levels prior Clerics have a major advantage. However, its worth noting that Beastlords get their first slow, Drowsy, at level 22.</P>

<P><table border=1>
<tr><td>Class</td><td>Level</td><td>Heal Name</td><td>HP</td><td>Mana</td><td>Cast Time</td><td>Efficiency</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cleric</td><td>30</td><td>Greater Healing</td><td>315</td><td>150</td><td>3.75</td><td>2.1</td></tr>

<tr><td>Beastlord</td><td>30</td><td>Herikol's Soothing</td><td>300</td><td>75</td><td>3.75</td><td>4</td></tr>
</table>

<P>At this level, Beastlords catch up to their parent Shaman class in healing, but once again have a <I>significant</I> mana efficiency advantage.</P>

<P>The next spell circle for Beastlord pet heals is level 39. Remember, Druids and Shamans do not receive their heal upgrade at this level. Druids have to wait until level 44, and Shamans 51. While clerics do receive Complete Healing at this level, as stated above it is ignored.</P>

<P><table border=1>

<tr><td>Beastlord</td><td>39</td><td>Yekan's Recovery</td><td>580</td><td>125</td><td>4.5</td><td>4.64</td></tr>
</table>

<P>What we see is, once again, beastlord heals pull <I>significantly</I> ahead of druids and shamans, and come very close to Clerics. The mana efficiency of Yekan's Recovery is almost twice that of Superior Healing; once again, the only advantage Clerics have is the 5% bonus.</P>

<P><table border=1>

<tr><td>Beastlord</td><td>49</td><td>Vigor of Zehkes</td><td>840</td><td>250</td><td>4.5</td><td>3.36</td></tr>
</table>

<P>At this level, beastlord heals pull <I>SIGNIFICANTLY</I> ahead of even Clerics! They take an efficiency decrease, but its off set by the sheer amount of healing capabilities of beastlord pet heals. Its safe to say, at this level, Beastlords are more apt at keeping their pet alive than Clerics are at keeping players alive!</P>

<P>At levle 52, beastlords get their quick heal; overall though its worse than Vigor of Zehkes, so it will be ignored.</P>

<P>Clerics finally catch up to Beastlord's Vigor of Zehkes, but beastlords pull ahead <I>again</I> with Sha's Restoration. However, a trend changes; Beastlord pet heals now, for the rest of a Beastlord's career, have a very long cast time compared to Cleric heals. They still have a much better efficiency increase. Also worth noting, at level 50, Beastlords get their second slow.</P>

<P>Beastlord pet heals are still <I>significantly</I> ahead of their parent class.</P>

<P>Clerics, for the first time in several levels, pull ahead of Beastlords in terms of total healing. Beastlords will, however, keep their advantage of efficiency. Also, at level 60, Beastlords get Sha's Advantage, their 50% slow spell (which effectively cuts mob damage output in half).</P>

<P>For this one level, Beastlord heals are better in efficiency and total amount healed over their parent class. However, the cast time is long enough to where its a virtual version of shaman's Kragg's Mending, but with the ability to be hasted with Spell Haste.</P>

<P>Including Gates healing, Clerics <I>finally</I> gain their mana efficiency edge over Beastlord healing. Druids finally catch up to Beastlords in amount healed. Shaman, on the other hand, lag significantly behind. Its worth noting that Beastlords have a 65% slow at level 65. (Shaman get 75%)</P>

<P>The general trend is that Beastlord healing is <I>significantly</I> better than their parent class of Shaman. Additionally, until the high 50s, Beastlords are more potent healers than even Clerics, and throughout virtually their whole career also have more efficient heals.</P>

<P>It would seem the statement "Because Shamans have slow, they have the weakest heals. So, one would argue that slow is so powerful, less heals are needed" does not apply to Beastlords as well.</P>

<h1>Magician and Beastlord Pets and Heals</h1>

<P>Its been said that Magicians have the best pets. While statistically this may be true, it no longer seems that Magicians are capable of supporting their pet adequately. But before we get into that, we should compare the general statistics of each pet.

<P>Note: Hit points listed are to the best of my knowledge.</P>

<P>Its fairly reasonable to say Magicians and Beastlords have very similar pets statistically. I'd be willing to wager, until the high end, they also midigate very closely to one another.</P>

<P>Short answer, they don't. Not only do beastlords have a <I>huge</I> healing advantage, they also don't have the penalty of a long duration recast timer.</P>

<P>But don't Magician pets have better midigation, you ask? Yes, they do, but it does not justify giving us weaker heals. <a href=http://www.beastlords.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1739>Take this sample parse</a> and <a href=http://www.beastlords.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1720>this sample parse</a> for Beastlords:

<P>Unslowed, yes, Magician pets end up tanking significantly better than Beastlord warders. However, its rare that a Beastlord will <I>ever</I> fight an unslowed monster, grouped or not; Magicians only have access to slow in groups, never solo. Even the stun from Ward of Xegony doesn't do enough to close the significant gap between Magician and Beastlord pet tanking.</P>

<P>How do the actual mana consumptions and healing <I>rates</I> stack up?</P>
<P><table border=1>

<P>In the above situations, the pure priest classes will have no problem chaining their quick heals to keep pets alive. Even the Beastlord is able to chain heal and keep his pet alive. The Magician, on the other hand, cannot heal <I>anything</I> unless the mob is first pre-slowed. In addition, Magicians are the only class that have to chain two heals in order to sustain his pet; Priests and Beastlords only need one.</P>

<P>Additionally, slow gives Beastlords a <I>permanent</I> advantage over Magicians in that they are never fighting a mob at full capacity, in a group or while soloing. Magicians, on the other hand, must rely on other classes to accomplish this.</P>

<h1>The Bottom Line</h1>
<h2>Magician Pet Midigation does <U>NOT</U> justify weak heals. Beastlord heals are too powerful given that they have near-magician strength pets, AND slow.</B></h2>

<P>Not only do Beastlords have close to equal pets to Magicians, but they have more potent heals than Clerics for most of their career, AND the ability to slow monsters substantially. Additionally, there is no valid reason to give magicians a healing penalty when no other class has one</P>

<P>To make matters worse:

<P>Because Beastlords have near-monk midigation, Beastlords are able to tank <I>for</I> their pet, and off-tank monsters themselves. Magicians have no such ability; all tanking must be directed towards only the pet. Beastlords have the capability to jump and tank for their pet at almost every level, midigating pet damage even further. Magicians can't, unless VERY highly geared, and even then for a very short time. Beastlords also have the ability to use their pet as a form of root, should they want to tank themselves; Fight monsters toe-to-toe, and when their health gets low, back off and heal themselves once the pet gains sufficient aggro. Again, mages can't do this.</P>

<h1>The Solution</h1>

<P>A TOTAL revamp of the healing lineup for Magicians, starting from the ground up.</P>

<P>Magician pet heals should be much, much more potent, equal to or better than Beastlord pet heals, and similar in strength to Cleric and Druid heals. Additionally, the long cast time and recast time <I>must go</I>.</P>

<P>I do not believe it appropriate for Magicians to be more potent healers than Clerics; however, Magicians should at least match the <I>healing rate</I> and <i>healing efficiency</I> that Beastlords can do.</P>

</table>

<P>Next, Magicians need ALL pet heals to go to Conjuration skill. Priests do not have the penalty of heals being one type, then spontaneously switching at higher levels, and neither should mages.</P>

<P>Third, Magicians must have healing AAs. Priests, Hybrids (including Beastlords) and even Necromancers get them. Why don't Magicians?</P>

<P>Finally, improved healing focuses need to be significantly more common for Magicians. As it stands, they are few and far between. The ones that are present are very expensive to acquire, if they are indeed able to be acquired. More low-level items with Improved Healing need to be Mage Usable, and easily attainable.</P>
