<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Falthrik Lothoro says 'Rrrrr. Many stories
Falthrik has to tell. Most would not suit you, would not translate to common
well but perhaps I tell you <font color="#FFFFFF">[history]</font> of Kerrans,
stories of their past and present.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">You say, 'What history ?'</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Falthrik Lothoro says 'So you wish to listen?
That is good. Then sit, listen to the story of the pride. Our stories all start
the same. In the beginning there was the mighty Kejaan. No one remembers the
lineage of Kejaan. Many think he didn’t have one. It is said no god made him,
that his spirit came from the winds and his body from the rocks. Wherever he
came from his <font color="#FFFFFF">[legends]</font> are many.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">You say, 'What legends ?'</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Falthrik Lothoro says 'Kejaan traveled the land
of Odus far and wide. He visited the splintered and fighting tribes of Kerran
and gathered together his companions, Kerrans of power and knowledge. Together
Kejaan and his companions tamed the wild lands of Odus. They journeyed through
jungle, desert, and beach killing monsters and evil. They made the land safe for
all Kerrans. This is when the <font color="#FFFFFF">[golden time]</font>
started.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">You say, 'What golden time ?'</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Falthrik Lothoro says 'Rrrrr. The golden time.
After Kejaan and his companions tamed the lands he came back to the splintered
tribes. With his strength of claw and mind he <font color="#FFFFFF">[united]</font>
all the Kerran people around him, made them into a mighty civilization, made
them strong and smart.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">You say, 'What united ?'</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Falthrik Lothoro says 'Many hundreds of years
the Kerran were mighty and wise. Elves, dwarves, humans, all races knew the
might of Kerra. All things end though, and our empire fell eventually, our proud
history and achievements torn apart and destroyed by the foul Erudites. We could
have shared land but the haughty Erudites would not share so they <font color="#FFFFFF">[destroyed]</font>.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">You say, 'What destroyed ?'</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Falthrik Lothoro says 'Destroyed utterly. Tried
to remove all trace of great Kerran works. Cities, statues, writings. All gone.
Kerrans fled to this tiny island, forced to leave by Erudites. Many Kerran, many
of our finest peoples, died on travel to here. Poets, warriors, shamans,
children. Kerran settled here, made this little island of dirt home, continued <font color="#FFFFFF">[old<br>
customs and traditions]</font>.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">You say, 'What old customs and traditions ?'</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Falthrik Lothoro says 'Yes. How we live. Way we
organize. In Kerran peoples magic runs greatest in the females. They grow larger
and stronger. It is females who are most worshipped and revered as mothers and
protectors. That is why all adult female Kerra live in inner village and all <font color="#FFFFFF">[male]</font>
live on beach.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">You say, 'What male ?'</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Falthrik Lothoro says 'Male Kerran smaller and
quicker than female. Male Kerra make good guards. Females watch after Kerran
souls and guide Kerrans, males guard Kerran safety. All Kerran understand their <font color="#FFFFFF">[place]</font>
in life.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">You say, 'What place ?'</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Falthrik Lothoro says 'Many places. Young live
on beach and learn how to be shaman, guards, or trades people. Old live their
last days on beach teaching the young. Males guard all of Kerra. Females guard
the inner village, our leaders, and our spirits. It is the way of things. Rrrrr.
I have talked for so long. I must eat and rest now.</font>
