All of the over 300 AAs were affected by this change. Some of the AAs have since been behaving incorrectly and we feel that these AA problems are enough of a hindrance to gameplay that it is necessary to correct them tonight.<br><br>Here is the list of changes we have for you tonight;<br><br>- AA abilities that were previously usable when using a discipline, sitting, or under the effects of stun, divine aura, or silence should once again be usable in those situations.<br><br>- Resolved an issue with Warriors Shielding that caused it to cancel instantly.<br><br>- A bug in the Iksar Necro skullcap quest that allowed players to obtain it illegitimately has been fixed.<br><br>- Several tradeskilled items have had their values modified to prevent a profitability exploit.<br><br>- The key to Veeshan&#39;s Peak is now No-Drop on Firiona Vie.<br><br>We apologize to those of you, who had raids and other activities scheduled tonight and thank you for your patience.<br><br>Thanks all&#33; <br><br>- The EverQuest Team </font><br><br></td>

<td width="100%"><font size="2">Headlines&#33; <br>-------------------<br><br>Veeshan&#39;s Peak has been re-worked. Enjoy the new challenge. <br>A new Adventure Zone appears on Stormhammer.<br>You can now remove augments without losing them.<br><br>Veeshan&#39;s Peak&#33; <br>-------------------<br><br>With this revamp we have Updated the level and NPC list for the zone: Please note that this zone is now an elemental level zone&#33; The entry quest to Veeshan’’s Peak has been changed. The original key quest has not been modified. However, the new entry quest uses the old key and offers an alternate quest to do instead of the original key quest. <br><br>- Items in the zone are now of elemental planes quality.<br><br>- Faction now matters: Dragons in Veeshan’s Peak will now speak to players if you have the correct faction and can understand them.<br><br>- New quests and lore: The dragons in Veeshan’s Peak will now give players the option to acquire items through questing for them.<br><br>- The zone is now an exp zone as well: Hunting in the areas before the dragons yields experience and loot.<br><br><br>New Adventure Zone for Stormhammer <br>-------------------<br><br>Stormhammer gains a new adventure zone. This is a 2 group adventure zone for characters of level 65.<br><br>Can you help the Eldritch Collective find and rescue Professor Bartleby Beckelbracker? Search the Desert of Ro for the whereabouts of Bartleby and his assistant Bomo and try to save them from the steel clutches of their enemies.<br><br><br>Augment Removal *<br>-------------------<br><br>- You can now purchase special "distillers" that will remove augmentations without destroying them. These distillers are sold by a merchant in Butcherblock. The item inspect window for an augmentation will tell you which distiller is required to remove it.<br><br>- The existing solvents can still be used to destroy an augmentation if you don&#39;t want to keep it. You no longer need a different solvent for each augmentation slot. The interface will allow you to select which augmentation you wish to delete.<br><br>- For those with custom UI&#39;s, you will need to update your EQ_Container.xml file in order to use the new augment window.<br><br>Pets * <br>-------------------<br><br>- Zoning pets are in. Persistent pet data includes: Items, Spell Effects, hit points, mana, name, height, and mana cost to summon them. All PC summoned pets should zone with you in all instances except for when you die. Pets will also follow the same rules as no rent items if you log with a pet.<br><br>- Pets can be shrunk again. Please wash them in only Cold water to prevent inadvertently reducing their size.<br><br><br>Tribute Changes * <br>-------------------<br><br>- Some items have had their favor value lowered.<br><br>- Players will now "Pre-pay" for tribute benefits. When benefits are activated, the player will immediately be charged for those benefits from their Favor pool. After that, the player will be charged every 10 minutes for the next 10 minutes of benefit. If benefits are deactivated before the timer is depleted, no refund is given for the time remaining.<br><br>- Players now have the ability to activate/deactivate the tribute benefits they&#39;ve selected (as a whole) whenever they like using a button on the Tribute Benefit Window. However, every time the player activates his benefits, he will be "Pre-pay" (see above). The ability to change selected benefits (downgrade) away from the Tribute Master has been removed.<br><br>- When visiting a Tribute Master, the player&#39;s benefits will deactivate. Players may re-organize their selected benefit load, but will not be able to "preview" the benefits (seeing the effect on their character when the benefit is selected). Benefit descriptions should give the player a good indication of what the benefit will do when activated.<br><br>- The EQ Label that shows the Tribute Benefit Timer will now show green when benefits are active and gray when they are not.<br><br>Item Changes <br>-------------------<br><br>- Manastones will no longer work in Forgotten Halls. It was not intended for the item to be used there and some naughty folks were taking advantage of the zone.<br><br>- Malcohm Thimbleton, in the Plane of Knowledge will now swap out some Robe Graphic items for Tunic Graphics. *<br><br>- The Staff of Revealed Secrets now has a 2hb weapon model instead of the little stick it had before. Enjoy your bigger stick.<br><br>UI Changes <br>-------------------<br><br>- It is now possible to display your mana as a numeric value on your inventory screen. *<br><br>- By mousing over your buff icons, you will now be able to see the buffs remaining duration. *<br><br>Berserkers <br>-------------------<br><br>- Berserkers now have innate crits beginning at level 12.<br><br>- Tainted Axe of Hatred now comes in stacks of 20.<br><br>Additional Notes <br>------------------- <br>- You now have the ability to sell back LDoN items and augments to the adventure merchants for a percentage of their original cost. *<br><br>- We have increased the number of NPC debuff slots from 30 to 50. Necromancers rejoice. *<br><br>- The Doppleganger AA&#39;s re-use timer has been reduced to 30 minutes. *<br><br>- Sprint and Planeswalk have had their movement rate increased. *<br><br>- Beware&#33; Many named mobs in Gates will now summon.<br><br>- The Hide all traders option, for the Bazaar, will no longer need to be reset each time you enter the zone. *<br><br>- /stopspellcast will no longer give spells recast delays.<br><br>- Leadership: Group/Raid mark npc should now update for people that are added to the group or raid.<br><br>- Main assist will no longer clear if the main assist zones.<br><br>- Bards should once again play the stringed instrument animation when playing a stringed instrument song.<br><br>- Hynid fleshrippers, tide feasters, and shore stonemites in Natimbi no longer hit so hard.<br><br>-- The EverQuest Team<br><br>*Denotes a change requested by the community</font><br><br></td>

<td width="100%"><font size="2">On June 11, 2004, questions from the Magician community were sent to SOE President John Smedley, and Everquest Community Relations Manager Alan Crosby (aka Brenlo).<br><br><br><P>John Smedley, Alan Crosby, and the entire EverQuest development team,<br><br><P>On behalf of the Magician community, I thank you for this opportunity for<br>reading this feedback and for answering our questions.<br><br><P>With the Omens of War expansion coming up so soon after the (poorly<br>implemented) Gates of Discord expansion, the entire EverQuest community has<br>place extreme criticism over Sony Online Entertainment. I needn&#39;t go into<br>the flaws with Gates of Discord; however, SOE, until recently, seemed poised<br>to repeat the mistakes of the last five major expansions:<br><br><P>-Creating class imbalance due to level increases, mob difficulty increases,<br>and poor creativity and implementation in class abilities and spells.<BR><br>-Alienating the common player, and catering to the high end player base (aka<br>uber-guilds).<BR><br>-Providing little or no benefit to low and mid level players, and providing<br>heavy emphasis on the high level player base.<BR><br>-Straying away from the fantasy roleplay aspects of the game, and instead<br>concentrate on "alien" themes.<BR><br>-Making the game less "fun" by removing, among other things, the "Quest" in<br>"EverQuest."<br><br><P>The Magician community addresses the representatives of the EverQuest<br>development team and seeks to find out more about the new expansion to<br>determine its value.<br><br><P>However, before we can understand Omens of War, we must understand the<br>Magician class further. We MUST know the CURRENT state of the Magician<br>class. Therefore, I present these specific questions.<br><br><P>-What is Sony Online Entertainment&#39;s definition of the Magician class? What<br>is our role?<BR><br>-What is our relative rank among "DPS" classes? Among other spell caster<br>classes?<BR><br>-Are we, or are we not, the premier pet class? If so, why are we less<br>capable of supporting our pets as other classes? Why are Dire Charm pets<br>perceived as outdamaging our pets?<BR><br>-Are we, or are we not, a soloing class? If we are, why is soloing from<br>level 61 beyond far less viable than it was from levels 1 to 60? Why do many<br>classes (especially classes able to Kite and Quad-Kite) have a superior solo<br>advantage?<BR><br>-At this point in the game, why are we the only caster that has no way to<br>survive a hostile environment except Gate?<BR><br>-Why are Magician pet heals so lacking?<br><br><P>The members of the Magician community also want to know answers to the<br>following class balance issues.<br><br>-Why are druids overall a better nuke class than Magicians? [Note: As of<br>June 9th, Test server was patched to bridge the gaps between Magician and<br>Druid post-level-63 nukes. However, Druids still retain their nuking<br>advantage from levels 1 to 62, and 63+ with Quick Damage]<BR><br>-Is our pet expected to cover the full range of abilities (Root, Snare, etc)<br>that other classes have?<BR><br>-Where are the pet-specific focus items? (Aeromancy, Aquamancy, Geomancy,<br>Pyromancy)<BR><br>-Why has it taken so long to resolve the issues with the 51+ fire pets?<BR><br>-When will Magicians receive a form of defense that is actually usable by a<br>level 50 mage with zero AA?<BR><br>-Why was the summoned population of Plane of Fire apparently nerfed, while<br>Planes of Earth and Air were left untouched?<BR><br>-Will pets ever return to high (invulnerable or near) resists to specific<br>element AoEs?<br><br><P>There are several things known about the new expansion. However, the<br>Magician community seeks more specific answers to the following questions.<br><br><P>The number one question on EVERY EverQuest player&#39;s mind is:<br><br><P>-What kind of Quality Assurances will be in place to ensure the "Cluster"<br>(as elequantly put at the Guild Summit) does not happen again in Omens of<br>War, and future expansions?<br><br><P>Furthermore, the following questions about Omens of War are asked by the<br>Magician Community:<br><br><P>-What is the expected level range for Omens of War zones?<BR><br>-Related to the above question, will the Gates expansion be required to gain<br>access to Omens zones?<BR><br>-Will the Epic 2.0 be accessible to Non-Time-equipped players?<BR><br>-Will the Epic 2.0 quests be mostly 1 groupable, or will raids be required<br>for most parts of the epic?<BR><br>-Will summoned creatures be put into the new (and retroduced into existing)<br>zones so we have a reason to use our anti-summoned spells?<BR><br>-Related to the question above, will there be a continuation of the poorly<br>implemented summoned-charm and summoned-mesmerization spell lines?<BR><br>-Will a large number of Omens zones be seeded with direcharm-able (normal,<br>animal, and undead) creatures? If so, how many will also be seeded with<br>level 60 summoned and charmable creatures?<BR><br>-Will there be any new spell lines for Magicians? In general?<BR><br>-Will existing IV focus items and focus items from the Elemental Planes and<br>beyond be usable from level 66 and up?<BR><br>-Will Magicians be receiving any kind of aggro reducing abilities or spells?<BR><br>-Will spells in Omens be common, similar to Kunark, Luclin, and Planes of<br>Power, or will they be rare and hard to obtain, leaving only the elite few<br>to collect them?<BR><br>-Related to the above question, will spell scrolls be NO DROP?<BR><br>-Will there be new content for low to mid level players?<BR><br>-Will the new Task System be implemented for ALL levels of characters?<BR><br>-Will magicians get the needed resist modifiers to our damage spells that<br>all other dps casters (dru/wiz/nec) get? (Even bards were given a -50 resist<br>modifier in their attack spells recently)<BR><br>-Are there plans for an upgraded Mod Rod in Omens?<br><br><P>Finally, the community wants to know about the state of Everquest&#39;s future.<br><br><P>-When will Everquest return to being a fantasy role-playing game, rather<br>than the space/alien themes of Shadows of Luclin, Gates of Discord, and<br>apparently Omens of War?<BR><br>-When will Roleplaying become a significant part of game play again?<BR><br>-When will we hear feedback about our class balance posts that are on the<br>official SOE boards?<BR><br>-Will there be new models for pets in Omens of War and the new graphics<br>engine?

Our new Tutorial is Live and ready to teach them to play.  Creating a new character will give you the option to go through the new tutorial.  You can choose to leave the tutorial at anytime and can return until your character reaches level 5.  The tutorial will walk you through gameplay with easy to follow instructions in text and voice.      <br>- Hybrids will now receive mana at level 1 as they now receive a spell in the tutorial.<br><br>CS Assist<br>-------------------<br>A new CS tool is available for use and should provide you with a better interface when petitioning.

We wouldn&#39;t want all those Halflings to drown, now would we? <br>- Rogues should be able to more easily exit water while sneaking, although I think it would be hard to sneak with wet trousers. <br><br>Misc.<br>-------------------<br>- You now have the ability to "AutoBank" in the Bank Window.<br>- Casting a spell while sitting will stand you up.<br>- Camping while standing will sit you down automatically.<br>- NPC&#39;s will not begin regenerating immediately if fleeing or combat ends. <br>- Improved the Iqthinxa Karnkvi event in Qvic</font><br><br></td>

Knights in particular should find it easier to tank the NPCs they previously had difficulty with.<br>- Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order to complete the Ikkinz trials. Only one person needs to complete all events/raids to start the seventh Ikkinz trial. At that point, all players who complete the seventh trial will get full credit for the zone.<br>- NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably.<br>- Zone travel has been made easier. Animal aggression was lowered by changing their faction and See Invis percentages were reduced on several NPCs.<br>- Spell drops have been increased.<br>- Increased the rate of cash drops.<br>- The mini bosses in Qvic now have a more appropriate respawn rate.  Their item drop rate has been increased to compensate for this.<br>- Breakdown in Communication quest now has improved rewards&#33;<br><br>Collision<br>-------------------<br>More improvements to the collision system should make it a lot more difficult to get stuck.<br><br>Misc.<br>-------------------<br>The Eye of Zomm will once again open closed doors.</font><br><br></td>

Please remember to read the naming policy as listed on EQlive.station.sony.com as it applies to both first names and surnames.

The longer you sit, the faster you regenerate&#33; <br>- You will not receive increased regen while under the effects of a DOT or while feigned.<br>- You can now bandage yourself up to 70% of your HP. Folks with the appropriate AA abilities can bandage above 70%.<br>- You can now bandage while sitting.<br><br>/rewind<br>----------------------<br>/rewind is back and should help if you find yourself stuck.  This is not an automatic rewind, you will have to execute the command.  We are continuing to work on other collision issues and hope to no longer need /rewind in the near future. This command is only able to be used once every 30 seconds, and in order to make use of it, your character will need to be stationary for at least 30 seconds.</font><br><br></td>
