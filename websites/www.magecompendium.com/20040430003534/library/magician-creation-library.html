<P><b>Issues to consider</b>:
<ul>
1. Race<BR>
2. Religion<BR>
3. Starting Stats and Bonus Points
</ul>

<P><b><U>What are the differences between races?</U></b>

<P>In general, Magicians are considered a "Neutral" class. There are no major penalties associated with being a Magician

<P><b>Dark Elf</b> - Considered an "Evil" race, and will be KOS to many good races. Racial ability to Hide, as well as innate Ultravision. Can wear small and medium armor.

<P><b>Erudite</b> - Erudite Magicians are considered a neutral/good race, and will be KOS to the Paineel Heretics. Agnostic Magicians will be welcome in Neriak. No form of night vision. Can wear medium armor.

<P><b>Gnome</b> - Considered a "Neutral" race, but will be KOS to some evil races. Smallest race in stature. Racial ability to Tinker, and innate Infravision. Can wear small armor.

<P><b>High Elf</b> - Considered a "Good" race, and will be KOS to evil races. Innate Infravision. Can wear medium and small armor.

<P><b>Human</b> - Considered a "Neutral" race, but will be KOS to some evil races. No form of night vision. Can wear medium armor.

<P><b><U>Which Race is the best?</U></b>

<P>In truth, there is no one "Best" race to pick. While each race has its own advantages, they also have disadvantages. For example, Erudites possess the highest INT, but also have low STR, AGI, and no form of night vision. Conversely, while Humans have the lowest INT, they are also very balanced stat-wise. All race and deity combinations are viable, and all should be considered.

<P>It is also important to remember that, at high levels, maxing INT is rarely a major concern, and a Magician's gear can offset any racial disadvantage.

<P>Only Gnomes can tinker. That must be considered at character creation.

<P><b><U>Which Religion should I follow?</U></b>

<P>Religion serves to adjust your character's starting faction in relation to the rest of Norrath, at character creation. For example, Dark Elves are not inherintly KOS to some cities, but if they choose to worship Innoruuk, many cities will consider them enemies while others will consider them allies.

<P>Religion also serves to determine what, if any, cultural armor a player can wear. Each race has deity specific player-made armor that they can wear, and only characters worshipping the appropriate deity can wear such armor.

<P>Most magicians would be wise to choose Agnostic, as it will allow the greatest range of travel across Norrath.

<P><b><U>Spending Bonus Points</U></b>

<P>The traditional wisdom has been: All Races should spend 25 points in INT. The other five should either go into STA or AGI.  However as the game has evolved and expanded over the years this is not as definitive as it once was.  While your mana pool is determined by your INT, maxing ones INT is hardly a challenge even for lower level charactors with the introduction of the Bazaar and serverwide auction channels.

<P>My personal recommendations are you first choose a race based on faction issues and appearence.  Once you have decided on a race, I recommend you increase the statistics that are the hardest to raise via equipment.  Those stats are Agility, Dexeterity, and Stamina.  Try and get at least 75 in each and devote the rest to INT.
