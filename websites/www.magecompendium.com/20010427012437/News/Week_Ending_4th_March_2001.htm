<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">1. Are there plans
to split any servers in the next month?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">2. Are there plans
to add any new servers in the next month?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">3. Are there plans
to split any servers in the next 3 months?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">4. Are there plans
to add any new servers in the next 3 months?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not that I know of. But that
doesn't mean that there won't be new servers some time in the near future, just
that there aren't any plans that I know of for one. As I've said several times
before, as soon as we make such plans, we let you know.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">5. Are there plans
to increase lvl 55+ spell drops in the next 2 months?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">6. Are there plans
to sell lvl 55+ spells (that are currently dropped) from vendors in the next 2
months?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">6a. Are there
plans to make lvl 55+ spells (that are currently dropped) questable in the next
2 months?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're still looking at all that
stuff from the class talk threads. Again, as soon as we have solid plans about
these things, we'll let you know. I'm not prepared to predict the unknown…</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">7. Will there be
an adjustment made to the Cleric/Hate issue on the next patch?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Seems likely. There are changes on
Test now. They might go live, they might not. Until we're done testing them we
don't know. But it seems likely that at least some of the changes on Test
currently will go live.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">8. When the
servers drop as they did today can we please get something posted on the system
status/scheduled downtime page to inform us of what is going on?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That often depends on why they
went down. Often the servers seem to go down because of ISP problems at one end
or the other. We do our best to get a notice up. But for very short-term outages
it's not always practical or useful to put up a notice.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">9. Will changes to
the epic quests be made in the next month?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don't know. We're working on
some changes. Because these changes are complicated and important, we're not
going to make them until we're ready.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">10. Are there
plans to make the Pegasus cloak tradeable?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not that I know of.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">11. Are there
plans to change the faydedar spawn so that at least a handful of druids can get
their epic?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">12. Are there
plans to move ranger/druid drops off VS or at least split them up so you don't
have 2 classes competing for the same drops?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">See answer to #9.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">13. Will more
boats be added within the next 2 months?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not that I know of.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">14. Are there
plans to change the SLeeper's tomb key to soulbound item</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not that I am aware of.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">15. Are there
plans to fix the Monk Mend issue in the next 2 months?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're working on locating the
problem.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">16. Are there
plans to release the zone THE WARRENS in the next 2 months?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is planned. We'll announce
it's release when we nail it down.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">17. Is POM
Itemized at this time?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As far as I know it is.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">18. Has anyone
from a LIVE server gotten any items out of POM other than the cards we are
hearing about?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don't know.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">19. Are there
plans within the next 6 months to release diety specific quests (such as POG)?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Deity specific? I don't understand
the question.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">20. Are there
plans to reduce the UBER MOBS HP or offensive power in the next 2 months?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are looking at some of the
creatures of Velious for potential change.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">21. Would you
consider setting up special chat room sessions with people who post on this
board to discuss customer communication issues in a small group format?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have developer chats just about
every month, hosted by fan sites. We are considering hosting some ourselves. But
it doesn't seem likely that we would restrict attendance to any sub-group of
players.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">22. Are there
plans to upgrade ranger defense in the next 2 months?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, we're looking at all the
class balance stuff. We'll certainly let you all know when we've made decisions.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">23. Are there
plans to implement better written polls on the log in board (the last one on
customer service gave many of us no choice to really voice our opinion on the
quality of customer service)?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No. We plan to start writing polls
in thieves cant so that nobody can understand them…</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I find it amusing that you would
ask a question that leaves me no way to answer it under your rules (yes or no)
that is so skewed that just by answering I must also agree with your assumption
that the poll in question was poorly written. Perhaps you should reword that and
ask again.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">24. Do you play on
a live server?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sure do.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">25. If the answer
to 24 is Yes is your character above lvl 50?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don't talk about my characters.
I will not reveal level, class, race… none of that. Doing so, unless I could
claim to have played all classes and all races to 60th level, would do nothing
to improve my credibility. It would only serve to focus people on the facts of
my class preferences and be a hindrance to conversation on nearly any topic.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">26. Are there
plans to give the clerics a JOLT type spell in the next 2 months?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not that I know of.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">27. Are there
plans to implement more portal type spells in the next 2 months?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not that I know of.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">28. Are there
plans to revamp POA in the next 2 months?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don't know. I haven't heard any
such rumors.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">29. Are there
plans to implement more bind points in the next 2 months?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've already announced such
plans. The exact date of implementation is not set. Again, we'll announce them
when we know them.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">30. Are there
plans to change the Succor type spells so they will become more effective in
cuttong down on travel time (ie DL and WK place group near a current portal
rather than the opposite end of zone which would be MUCH more helpful in cutting
down travel time)?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I have no idea. It seems unlikely
to me, though.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">31. Are there
plans to reduce the Spellbook med from lvl 35 to lvl 20 within the next 3
months?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Not that I know of.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sorry, I don't follow restrictions
like only yes or no. They certainly don't make your questions easier to answer.
Some of your questions just can't be answered with only a yes or no. My general
answer is that we'll announce changes as we decide them.</font>
