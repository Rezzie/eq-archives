have a few different characters on the game, but in all honestly I love playing
the Magician. I am not one for many words really so I will get right to the
point. I started a Gnome Mage, dumped all my points into intelligence (of
course) and the remaining into Agility, don’t ask me why I just like to do
that. Anyhow...</span></font></p>

wacked everything in sight in The Steamfont Mountains until level 4, WhooHoo
Pets! Level 1 - 4 are kind of tedious but can be done in a sitting or two.</span></font></p>

you get your first pet spells the wait will be worth it. By level 4 u should
have collected enough coin to buy most of your spells and hopefully as much
cloth armor as possible). If you do not have enough coin, at least by the Fire
Elemental for Steamfont, The 2nd pet I summoned coned yellow to me. The pets
range 1-3 levels from your own. If you are lucky enough to get a con yellow pet
(and you will) that means you can take on yellow monsters and more often than
not, red... Great Experience. With a high intelligence and a pet you will level
faster than any other class in the game (almost anyway). Just explore your
surrounding area and get loot and experience until level 8, get a bubble or 2
into 8 though.</span></font></p>

I did is got the invisibility spell and high tailed it to the lovely human city
of Qeynos (sonyeq) I got bound there (not hard to do just shout it out as you
know) and head to Blackburrow. Great Experience. Never hard to group here and
Humans love Gnomes, especially the ladies hehe. KILL, LOOT, KILL, LOOT… get
the idea, you can stay here until level 16 - 20 depending on how patient you
are.</span></font></p>

to change things up a bit take the boat to Erud’s Crossing. The boats first
stop is in Erud’s Crossing. Wisps… CHA CHANG is all I got to say about these
little bad boy light bulbs. You can get almost 8pp for a single Greater Light
stone and about a plat for a regular light stones. A couple of days here and you
will be able to afford a hot tub in Steamfront :-). B.T.W. I started killing
Wisps with a friend same level at level 10. Get killed sometimes but well worth
the coin.</span></font></p>

it for now, check back in a few weeks and I’ll give you a run down when I have
progressed further :-).</span></font></p>
