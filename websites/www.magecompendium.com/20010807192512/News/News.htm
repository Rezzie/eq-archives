<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Switching spell
slots to buff does indeed almost always occur during downtime. Switching the
spells, however, does not create downtime, because you are medding during swaps
anyway. The entire point that you missed, is that this is incredibly tedious to
do, particularly for buffing classes. I play a chanter twink, i experience it
every day. These solutions are being suggested to reduce the tediism(sp?)
involved, NOT to reduce downtime.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Recently you have
added several features that reduce tedious things like buying stacks of food,
etc. There is a solution here that will reduce the tediousness of switching out
buffs without decreasing downtime, or giving any other gameplay advantage. I
really like the idea of extra slots, say 4, reserved for buffs only. Maybe this
is the solution, i haven't thought of anything wrong with it, but perhaps there
is a better idea.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, increasing the number of
spell gems certainly does affect the balance of the game and all that above and
beyond reducing tedium.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The idea of some sort of less
tedious method for swapping spells might be feasibly set up so that it would
only reduce the tediousness of the activity without affecting much else. I'm
certainly not against that idea at all. Though I can imagine that it might be a
lot of programming work.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The idea of adding extra slots
that only accept buffs… that would be a change in the effectiveness of casters
and their groups, making them that much more versatile.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In any case, I've sent both ideas
to the team. Something like this isn't likely to see much internal discussion
right now, what with all the other stuff going on here.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Here is the
problem that I think is not being recognized. I have 8 spell slots to use -- but
hardly any of them are free to be used. As a Shaman I ALWAYS have the following
spells memd and do not swap them out: gate, heal and root. 3 down at all times.
When I am in the field I have more spells that I do not swap out: malise and
slow. Leaving me with 3 slots, just 3 slots that can be swapped. Since sitting
down to swap spells out during combat can get you killed I am stuck in a 'mode'
of operation regardless of what happens in the fight. There is also the spell
cannibalize which I can only swap out for a minute or so. Down to just 2 slots
that can be used reliably to get 'strategic' with. 2 slots are not enough and
there are spells I have never even gotten a chance to use because of that
restriction. I am certain it is much the same with other casters but from my
point of view Shaman have it the worst.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But you've made my point.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Since
  sitting down to swap spells out during combat can get you killed…&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Exactly. A lot of the strategy
playing your shaman is picking what spells you'll need before the fight. If you
have access to all the spells that you can even vaguely imagine that you'll
need, there's no strategy until the fight starts.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And, well, you're the one that
decides which spells you will always have memorized. Personally, I've played
several casters that only memorize gate when I need it to go someplace. I rarely
use it for escape, simply because I don't usually like to escape without my
party. But that's how I do it. You do it differently. You 'set' spells vary from
mine, and probably from most other players. That, too, is part of the strategy.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If you want to cast the spells
that you've never 'gotten the chance' to cast, then memorize them. Break from
your set spells and use them. Those chances to cast spells are always yours to
determine. You might just find some new combination of spells that works well
for you.</font>

message boards.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I applaud the
spell Focus of Spirit. Good job on that one, it really helps Shaman out a lot.
Three buffs in one, lasts a long time, good deal.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Only problem is, I
cannot use it on myself, if I want to use Voice of the Berserker. They don't
stack. VotB is level 59, so it's really only currently useful for one level.
Once you hit 60, it becomes useless.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Before Focus
existed, I could cast Talisman of Kragg, cast Maniacal Strength, and cast Mortal
Deftness. If I wanted to cast Voice of the Berserker, I could just click off
Mortal Deftness, and let VotB fly. Sure I couldn't use other spells for 20
seconds, but VotB is a very specialized spell.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The simple
solution is to just let Focus of Spirit and Voice of the Berserker stack. The
only downside I can say is that instead of 200 dexterity, the shaman will have
close to 255 dexterity. Big deal.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've had a few shaman reminding me
of this issue for a couple months, and I kept forgetting to get it corrected. I
finally remembered this time (You can thank Nixx and Jenemdar), it should be
corrected next patch.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">This spell was apparently
from all sources removed from play... as I understood it, it was simply the
opposite of shrink and only useable outdoors.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Why remove it ?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">On the flip side
why have it to begin with...</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Positives:<br>
Provides an aspect change that helps when fighting giants.<br>
Provides entertainment when running thru the long Karana Plains. Is in general a
nifty little spell with little to no ballance issue I can see.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Negatives:<br>
Costs money to purchase the spell or time to camp it if it's a dropped spell
Could make the EC tunnel more a pain in the bottom...</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Maybe just a
reason for us newbs as to why it was taken out would be great.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The coding for this spell was
never finished, as I've stated before.... I will try to get the spell in as soon
as possible.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">One of the things
I would put in the category &quot;Infuriating but Understandable&quot; is the
randomness of the invisibility spell.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I also understand
that higher level characters should be able to see through invisibility.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">But I do wonder
what use Superior Camouflage has.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Superior Camouflage
is supposed to be better than invisibility, yet in many of the places notorious
for lower level, invis seeing MOBs (Sol A, Firona Vie) it is just as completely
worthless as Invisibility.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">In other words, i
am having a hard time seeing where Superior Camo is really all that superior.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">If I ruled the
world, I would do one of two things:</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">1. Make Superior
Camo more resistant to some of those lower level invis seeing mobs; or</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">2. Giving Superior
Camo a solid minute where it is guaranteed not to drop, and then after that
minute, make the duration random.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Superior Camo, like every other
pre 50 invis spell, has a random expiration timer. This isn't going to change
any time soon, as we introduced the Improved invis spells in Velious that do
have a set duration. Superior Camouflage is Superior to normal Camouflage
because it can be cast indoors.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alan added :</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And keep in mind that there will
be, and should be, strengths and weaknesses for each spell. The fact that the
&quot;invisibility&quot; spells have a random duration until you reach at least
50th level is one of those weaknesses. It's strengths, well those are pretty
obvious.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Alan</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">SLN regens 2
points of health per tick, Natureskin regens 4 points... Protection of the
Glades is supposed to regen 6 points of hp and 6 points of mana per tick, but it
only regens mana. It is not regen'ing ANY HP. I've tested this numerous times</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Protection of the Glades does not
have a regeneration component, it never has since Velious release. When the
spell was put in it was decided to give it mana regeneration instead of hitpoint
regeneration. I hope that clears it up for ya.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alan added :</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As with the Growth spell question
above, it's not uncommon for one rumor or another to grow to the point where it
is assumed by some to be truth. It's important to keep that in mind. When you
hear yourself saying things like &quot;supposed to but doesn't&quot;, it might
be a good idea to step back and figure out where you learned what it was
supposed to do.</font>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Can someone please
take a look at the level 59 druid spell Legacy of Thorn. This is supposed to be
a 28 point group damage shield. Yesterday, I casted it with my level 60 druid
and it was only doing 24 points of damage.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thanks for pointing this out. The

the quest for it. At least, at the very least, let us know if it's live.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Velium Chill of Al'Kabor is not a
player spell, any confusion caused by it are as a result of parsing the spdat,
which I do not apologize for.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">In one of the
recent patches (July 10?) a new lvl 4 Mage spell was added into SPDAT.EFF. By
using a common parser tool (these are ok to use, right?) I and a few other mages
noticed this addition. What I and many other mages were wondering is if this
spell has been put into the game yet or was it just added to the .EFF? I don't
expect to be told where it can be found but if at all possible, I'd like to save
myself the multiple hours and porting fees that I would be spending to try and
find a spell that doesn't exist. If ye kin also let us know what it summons
exactly, it would be appreciated.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is not a player spell, see
previous statement about parsing the spdat.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And this is often the source of
the rumors that we so often have to respond to. Parsing the spdat file is really
not going to make your game play more enjoyable, folks. Play, have fun, and
enjoy the game. Tearing apart game files and then worrying about what you find
there isn't something that we encourage (ok, we actively discourage it).</font>
