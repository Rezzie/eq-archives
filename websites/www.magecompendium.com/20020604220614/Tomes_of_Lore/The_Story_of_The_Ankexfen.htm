<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This ancient tale of a civilization long since
forgotten by the name of Ankexfen was handed down to me by a visiting priestess
in Najena by the name of Aerthane D'Zitherak, a Priestess of Innoruuk, and
seeker of the Fabled and Ancient Staff of The Ankexfen.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">'Long ago, there existed a race known as the
Ankexfen, after their progenitor Hazeg Ankexfen, who were created by Rallos Zek
during the Elder Age.&nbsp; This race was quite intelligent and cunning.&nbsp;
They quickly expanded their knowledge of magic and the other planes, yet
constantly yearned for more power.&nbsp; So, along with their ogre counterparts,
they set out to master the Plane of Earth.&nbsp; Alas, their attempts proved
futile and the combined might of the other gods forced Rallos Zek back to the
Planes of Power, leaving his creations to the whims of the other gods. '</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">'The wrath of the unnamed gods was grim.&nbsp;
Thousands of ogres were instantly slain - their empire left to crumble under the
hand of retribution.&nbsp; The giants were flung across the face of Norrath like
seeds to the wind.&nbsp; The Ankexfen's fate was more severe.&nbsp; The entire
race was exterminated, but from the ashes were born the four goblin races.&nbsp;
Exactly how this happened is unknown.&nbsp; But what is known is that each
goblin clan was stripped of any knowledge and was neither informed of the other
clans nor of their origins.&nbsp; Each clan was then transported to a separate
environment to help preserve the gods' will.&nbsp; However, the gods were not
without mercy and each clan was granted a section of the staff.&nbsp; Upon each
staff, a crystal was adorned.&nbsp; These staves served to aid the goblin clans
in understanding their environment.&nbsp; These remnants of the Staff of
Ankexfen combine to create the fabled and powerful Staff of Ankexfen.</font></p>
