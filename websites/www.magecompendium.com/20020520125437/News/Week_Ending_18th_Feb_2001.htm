these lists:<br>
<br>
First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be
brought to the Live Team. This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not
telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<br>
<br>
Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here. Epic Quests,
Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests. Those three items were
mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<br>
<br>
All items are currently marked with NONE for status. Obviously we've already
started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on
the Test Server. I will be updating the status for items early next week to
reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team. I just
wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<br>
<br>
I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need
to be changes made. So this list is not final. But if you want something added
to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change. At this
point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already
reviewing the original list.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the input so far.<br>
<br>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Magicians:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: No Rent Items.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: Recently the way
players log back into the servers after disconnect was changed, and it affected
magicians (not to mention people holding no rent quest items). It would be nice
to fix this by making No Rent items disappear on log-in instead of log-out, and
only if the last log in time was more than 30 minutes prior. Whatever the
solution, Magicians are greatly inconvenienced by this change.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Rain Spells.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: It seems that
removing the pets from the equation would be the best way to make rain spells
useful without making them too useful. And it might also just eliminate the bug
where some pets attack other PCs when they are caught in a rain or AoE spell. It
might also be a good idea to look at the resist rates on these spells, which
seem to be higher than with most spells. Some people would also like there to be
one or two waves to these spell types.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Pathing.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: Any continuing
improvement on pathing would be a great benefit to magicians. There are several
places where the pathing, rather than the actual pet or the zone design intent,
is bad enough to exclude the use of a pet.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Notes: Plane of Hate, Chardok,
Nurga, the Hole, Old Sebilis, Trakanon’s Lair were the zones suggested.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Pets and AoE fear.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: Pets are unwanted
against any enemy that can cast an area of effect fear spell (and those are some
of the more important encounters, at least emotionally), because the pet will
always flee, and will often run directly into other monsters that the party does
not want to engage. It might be nice to give magicians the ability to make their
pets immune to fear for short periods of time. It could be debated about letting
them make other pets immune to fear. And it will most certainly be expected by
the players that immunity to fear would make sense for necromancer pets than
mage pets.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Voceration: Fire and Greater
Voceration: Fire.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: The claim is that
these two pets do less damage than the level 29 fire pet. Are they really less
useful than the 29th level pet?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Spell Drops.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: Players believe that
the 54th level Water Pet Spell (heck, all the 54th level pets) is dropping off
the wrong level monsters. There is a rumor that the water pet is dropping off of
lower level mobs in Skyfire. Is that really where it should drop? Also, the
Muzzle of Mardu is supposedly way too rare.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Pet Names.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: How about letting
players pick a pet name (just one per character) and have all of their pets
named by that name. It would be no more likely to be abused than the naming of
characters, and it would make people with pets much happier. Not to mention it
would help diversify the landscape a bit. Or, perhaps, have pets show up as
&lt;Character&gt;’s Pet.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Pet Graphics.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">How about a new graphic for high
level magician and enchanter pets, something to match the spectre for the necros.
At least can we look into getting an interesting look for the epic magician pet?</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: DoTs.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: Why give them DoT's
with Velious? It does seem a bit out of line.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Dyzil's Deafening Decoy.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: The claim is that it
doesn't actually decoy very well. The ability for this pet to taunt could be
increased. There seems to be no reason that it can’t be a super taunter. With
its low hit points, letting it taunt the heck out of things wouldn’t seem to
overpower it. Though, if it’s going to be attacked so much perhaps more hit
points would not be out of line. Also, perhaps making it more of an escape spell
would be a good idea. Give it a very short casting time (2 seconds), so that
magicians could summon it in bad situations real quick and then run like heck.
(Summary of requests for this spell: A lot more taunt, more hit points, 2 second
cast time).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None<br>
<br>
---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Higher level pet healing
spell.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: By giving them a
better pet healing spell (a standard upgrade) at higher levels, they can decide
if they want to heal or summon a new pet in a tight spot. The last one they get
is at 20th level, I think. It’s a good spell line that really should be
continued.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Improved Invisibility.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: Why don’t magicians
get this spell when all other Int casters do?</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Phantom Armor.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: Two concerns here.
The first is that it uses 4 components! That’s an awful lot of components to
carry around. It would be nice to make the component a single item that costs 4
(or even more) times as much. The second concern is that it is overwritten by
Shield of Words. It seems logical that the 52nd level personal magician spell
should hold over the 49th level cleric spell. Though the cleric spell seems to
have more AC, the mage spell also gives additional regen…</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Robe of Conjuration.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: Both necromancer and
magician pantaloons (legs) for caster classes give them mana free level 50 pet
buffs (Burnout III, Augment Death), but the necromancer robe has the level 57
Conjure corpse, while the Robe of Conjuration gives the level 49 damage shield.
How about changing the magician leggings to the level 56 damage shield?</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Pet Health Bars.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: It would be nice if
the magician could see his pet's health bar at all times. Even better if every
party member could see the health bars of all party pets.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Summoning text:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: There is no text
message when summoning magician pets. Necromancers get a ‘rises from the
dead’ emote. How about something for magician pets, a different one for each
type.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Magician Research.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: Magician research is
a little harsh compared to the others, with chain research and all. Perhaps this
could be changed a bit.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Pet SoW.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Summoned Levitation Rings.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: It seems that these
rings don’t always report the right number of charges left, often saying that
there is one left when there are none.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Summoned Staves.</font>

more of them were one-handed.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Shard of the Core.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: How about letting the
item summoned by this spell be equipable in the ranged slot, like the Coldstones
and Heatstones.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: None</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: Aegis of Ro.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: The players think
that this spell is more than rare, that it is not dropping at all. I've also
been told by a very few players (one that I can think of) that it does indeed
drop off a dragon in Dreadlands.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: Spell scroll was never
created. It is now dropping. Item fixed.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">---</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">ITEM: New Summoned Proc’ing
Weapons.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DESCRIPTION: With the recent
changes to the status of pets (making them Pets instead of NPCs) and the fix to
the way their weapons proc (and the ‘nerf’ of Sword of Runes) it should now
be possible to add new proc’ing summoned weapons for Magicians.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">STATUS: N/A – This is an idea
for future use, no action is expected on this item.</font></p>

Sony Online is aware of lag and packet loss that some European customers using
DTAG for Internet access are experiencing. We have been in communications with
our ISPs and are working out a solution to offload some of the DTAG traffic
destined for our networks to less congested circuits. The changes that our ISP
had to make were completed on 2/15/01. However, since we are not direct
customers of DTAG, we do not have a guarantee that DTAG will honor our request,
and therefore do not have an expected date of remedy.<br>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's
very hard to find anything wrong with the overall balance of this class. They
can solo for their entire career fairly well. Because of their pets, they are
welcome enough in any group, and at higher levels they get the Malo spell line
that makes them even more welcome. There is some concern about the use of pets
in higher level groups. Pathing in places can make them more of a danger than a
help. And any creature with an AoE fear spell will exclude the use of magician
pets. I'm not sure that these issues constitute any sort of imbalance, though.
Fixing them, however, would most certainly eliminate any concern that magicians
might have about having something to do in raids against the boss mob, or
against the high hit point Velious monsters. Having powerful pets gives them the
ability to contribute to the combat, regardless of the magic resistance of the
monster, or the magicians available mana. So, most of what is listed below are
essentially minor. The issue of a change to the way rain spells work crosses
several classes, though, and is the only real sweeping concern here. The change
to the way link death and logging back in works hit magicians pretty hard. The
tedium and expense of summoning new items when you go link dead is harsh.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No Rent Items: We all know what
happened when we changed the way players log back into the servers after
disconnect, and how that affected magicians (not to mention people holding no
rent quest items). The most viable solution for this seems to be making No Rent
items disappear on log in instead of log out, and only if the last log in time
was more than 30 minutes prior. This would be a perfect solution (and one that
I’ve heard the players suggest a few times).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rain Spells: Can we remove the
pets from the equation? Just this would probably make them useful without making
them too useful. I've looked at the numbers, and adding more waves would
probably overpower these spells by a large margin. We might want to look at the
resistance on these spells, though. They may be too high.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">New Summoned Proc’ing Weapons:
With the recent changes to the status of pets (making them Pets instead of NPCs)
and the fix to the way their weapons proc (and the ‘nerf’ of the Sword of
Runes) we also mentioned that we would be adding new proc’ing summoned weapons
for them. Perhaps something like this could be a good way to introduce a few
situational weapons.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pathing: Any continuing
improvement on pathing would be a great benefit to magicians. There are several
places where the pathing, rather than the actual pet or the zone design intent,
is bad enough to exclude the use of a pet.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Notes: Get specific zone examples
where pathing is at its worst.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pets and AoE fear: Pets are
unwanted against any enemy that can cast an area of effect fear spell (and those
are some of the more important encounters, at least emotionally), because the
pet will always flee, and will often run directly into other monsters that the
party does not want to engage. It might be nice to give magicians the ability to
make their pets immune to fear for short periods of time. It could be debated
about letting them make other pets immune to fear. And it will most certainly be
expected by the players that immunity to fear would make more sense for
necromancer pets than mage pets. But, as always, gameplay has to come before
appearances.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Voceration: Fire and Greater
Voceration: Fire: The claim is that these two pets do less damage than the level
29 fire pet. Are they really less useful than the 29th level pet? Can someone
check? If it is, should it be? Perhaps another careful examination of these pets
is in order…</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Spell Drops: Could someone look
into the 54th level Water Pet Spell (heck, all the 54th level pets) and
Blizzard, just to see if they are dropping off the right level monsters? There
is a rumor that the water pet is dropping off of lower level mobs in Skyfire. Is
that really where it should drop?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pet Names: How about letting
players pick a pet name (just one per character) and have all of their pets
named by that name. It would be no more likely to be abused than the naming of
characters, and it would make people with pets much happier. Not to mention it
would help diversify the landscape a bit. Or perhaps some other way to allow for
more interesting names than the list they are randomly chosen from now.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pet Graphics: How about a new
graphic for high level magician and enchanter pets, something to match the
spectre for the necros. At least can we look into getting an interesting look
for the epic pet, something like the original appearance (this thing looked
pretty cool the first time out, then something bad happened and it lost its cool
looks)?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rage of Zomm: How about making it
look like a big fat Eye of Zomm?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">DoTs: Why did we give magicians
DoT's with Velious? It does seem a bit odd.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dyzil's Deafening Decoy: The claim
is that it doesn't actually seem to decoy very well. We should up its ability to
taunt. I don’t see a reason that it can’t be a super taunter. With its low
hit points, letting it taunt the heck out of things wouldn’t seem to overpower
it. Though, if it’s going to be attacked so much maybe we should give it a few
more hit points. Also (or maybe instead), perhaps making it more of an escape
spell would be a good idea. Give it a very short casting time (2 seconds), so
that magicians could summon it in bad situations real quick and then run like
heck. (Summary of requests for this spell: A lot more taunt, more hit points, 2
second cast time).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Higher level pet healing spell: By
giving them a better healing pet healing spell (a standard upgrade) at higher
levels, we can force them to decide if they want to heal or summon a new one in
a tight spot. The last one they get is at 20th level, I think. It’s a good
spell line that seems worthy of continuation.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Improved Invisibility: Why don’t
magicians get this spell?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Phantom Armor: Two concerns here.
The first is that it uses 4 components! That’s an awful lot of components to
carry around. It would be nice to make the component a single item that costs 4
(or even more) times as much. The second concern is that it is overwritten by
Shield of Words. It seems to me that the 52nd level personal magician spell
should hold over the 49th level cleric spell. Though the cleric spell seems to
have more AC, the mage spell also give additional regen…</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Aegis of Ro: The players think
that this spell is more than rare, that it is not dropping at all. I've also
been told by a very few players (one that I can think of) that it does indeed
drop off a dragon in Dreadlands. Perhaps a slight increase in the drop rate on
this spell would be good. (Note: Obviously we've fixed this one since I wrote
this. This spell never was dropping, but is now.}</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pet Fear Immunity spell: One idea
that came in during the necromancer thread spurred me to suggest this. Area of
affect fear spells make pets unwanted in some places. How about we give
magicians a spell that would allow them to make a pet immune to fear for a short
while? (another note: See, the dev team DOES read these threads…)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Robe of Conjuration: Both
necromancer and magician pantaloons (legs) for caster classes give them mana
free level 50 pet buffs (Burnout III, Augment Death), but the necromancer robe
has the level 57 Conjure corpse, while the Robe of Conjuration gives the level
49 damage shield. How about changing the magician leggings to the level 56
damage shield?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Pet Health Bars: It would be nice
if the magician could see his pet's health bar at all times. Even better if
every party member could see the health bars of all party pets.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ok, keep in mind that this list
was written a while ago. Obviously some of these items have already been added.
And some of them really are not class balance issues (I wrote this up before the
idea of starting the class balance threads even existed). So, please, let's only
talk about these ideas (if you don't like them or think I've written them
incorrectly) and new ones. But please keep in mind, if you know you've stated it
before and it is not on this list, that's probably because I purposefully did
not add it to the list…</font>
