<H1>The Magician Epic Quest 2.0</H1>

<P>This is a work in progress, and is definitely <B>NOT</B> complete. Please help out and fill in gaps where needed. If you have a missing image, <a href=mailto:xalmat@magecompendium.com>Email it to me</a>. Just an FYI, this guide is printer friendly (Text will appear black when you print), but is a rather large amount of pages. Certain images and phrases will not print; this is intentional.</P>

<P>A couple disclaimers about this quest. You won't be able to skip around hail sequences; you must do them in order. Very little of the quest can be skipped around; Unless the mob or item is always up and does not involve a series of hails to trigger, you will not be able to get the item. Nothing can be MultiQuested, which was a common practice in most other quests. With that said, good luck!</P>

<P>While the 1.5 is completable by Elemental-geared people, the 2.0 is intended for end-gamers <I>Only</I>. Word is several pieces are located in the final zone, Asylum of Anguish, so if your guild has no plans of going there, don't bother with this second half at all.</P>

<P><B>Requirements: Group</B></P>

<P>You will need your <b class=item>Staff of Elemental Essence</B> to begin the Epic 2.0 quest.</P>

<P>Look for Iilivina is Dranik's Scar.</P>

<p class=quote><B class=you>You say, 'Hail, Iilivina'</B><BR><BR>
Iilivina says 'The magic here is quite unique. I am thrilled I've had the opportunity to study it.'</P>

<P>Give her your <B class=item>Staff of Elemental Essence</B>. Don't worry, you get it back.</P>

<P class=quote>Iilivina says 'My goodness, I did not realize you were the one [Bantil] sent to me! This is truly amazing! I was shocked when Magi'Kot's dream had been realized. I never thought it would be surpassed. My, so much focused elemental energy. This is truly amazing. You have accomplished quite a feat.'<BR><BR>
<B>You say, 'bantil'</B><BR><BR>
Iilivina says 'Yes, Bantil told me you would be coming. Perhaps we can help each other. There are two tribes of elemental beings here. They have an unprecedented ability to channel elemental energy. I have yet to see one with my own eyes, but they may just contain [power] that will help you unleash the staff's true power ' <BR><BR>
<B class=you>You say, 'power' </B><BR><BR>
Iilivina says 'They use the elements in a way we have yet to understand. I suspect something in their essence that allows them to tap into the elements in a different manner than we understand. If my suspicions are true, these creatures should leave behind a small portion of their essence, when their spirits leave their bodies. If you find anything like that, bring it to me. They may be rather small, so bring me two from each type for good measure.' </P>

<P>You will need to travel to <b class=zone>Riftseekers</B> and kill Pyrilen and Gelidran mobs, and collect two each of <B class=item>Pyrilen Essence</B> and <b class=item>Gelidran Essence</B>.</P>
