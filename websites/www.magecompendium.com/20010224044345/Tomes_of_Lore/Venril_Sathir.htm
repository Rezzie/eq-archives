The Kunzar</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As described in the Iksar Lore Books in Cabilis:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The greatest lizard to walk upon the land was
Venril Sathir of the Kunzar tribe. All that is known of his youth was that he
was a member of the ancient Kunzar Tribe. This was during the time of division
among the tribes of the Iksar. He was said to have never been a mere broodling.
He was forever a master of combat.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Venril would soon slay his father and take his
rightful place as chief of the Kunzar Tribe. He led the Kunzar on many
expeditions into the ruins and wilds of Kunark. He sought knowledge and weapons.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In his late youth, he find the hidden library
of the necromancer, Kotiz. He would come to open a large book which opened into
a small room. Climbing into the book he finds a floating book. The Unholy Writ
of War is it's title. Made of Iksar skins and containing great knowledge of
combat. Venril becomes the books master.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Venril soon shows signs of dark knowledge. He
begins to wield the forces of the dark circle and his knowledge of combat
tactics becomes supreme. He trains his army new tactics and even raises the
bones of the fallen to fight yet again for their master. His army grows and
marches to all corners of Kunark.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Venril Sathir's army is now unstoppable. He
shall soon plot the union of the entire Iksar nation. He no longer wishes to be
just Chief, but rather, Emperor. Under his direction the four remaining tribe
states of Iksar shall unite and a new age shall dawn.</font>
