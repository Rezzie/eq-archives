<P><B>Description:</b> Focus items make pets "better". If you equip a focus item while summoning a pet, the pet will generally be an improved version of itself, often having better defensive and offensive stats. They have a focus effect on them denoting they are focus items. (note that focus items do not "glow" when the pet is summoned).</P>

<P><B>There are 4 Minor Focus items: Focus level 4 to 49 pets</b><BR>
These four focus items are obtainable via quest from the gnome magician Vira within the Temple of Solusek Ro located off of the Lavastorm Mountains zone.  You must have at least indifferent faction standing to quest the minor focus items.<BR>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><i>*from level 34 to 49 the pets will appear visibly larger when focused</i> </span>
