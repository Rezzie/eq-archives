:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fennin Ro Split</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">PLEASE READ THIS MESSAGE IN ITS ENTIRETY</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We are in the process of finalizing plans to
implement a split of the Fennin Ro server as announced a few weeks ago. At the
time the split occurs, players from Fennin Ro will be moved to the new server on
a voluntary basis. Current Fennin Ro players that wish to have all their
characters moved from Fennin Ro to the Split Server will need to register for
the move.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The registration log will be opened on Monday
during prime-time hours. A server-wide Broadcast will be made on Fennin Ro to
announce that the Move Registration Log is open. Furthermore, a patch message
will be placed at that time to give the information to incoming players. PLEASE
DO NOT ASK THE GM/GUIDE STAFF THE TIME THAT THE REGISTRATION LOG WILL OPEN.
EXECUTING THE REGISTRATION COMMAND PRIOR TO THE TIME THAT REGISTRATION IS
OFFICIALLY OPENED WILL HAVE NO EFFECT AND MAY IMPAIR YOUR ABILITY TO REGISTER AT
THE PROPER TIME.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once the registration log is open, and assuming
you are a current FENNIN RO player, you may register for the move to the Split
Server by logging into a character on Fennin Ro, and executing the command '/movelog
yes' (without the quotes). YOU MAY NOT CANCEL THIS REGISTRATION AFTER IT HAS
BEEN ISSUED.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">PLEASE NOTE:</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The physical move should occur on the following
day (Tuesday). We will be moving people on a first-come-fist-serve basis, based
upon the order that you executed the /movelog command. The number of people that
will be moved is unknown at this time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Moves will be made without regard to guild or
group, meaning that should you choose to execute the /movelog command, you may
be separated from your friends. In addition, your guild affiliations
(guild-tags) will not carry over to the new server. You will need to establish
new guilds when you arrive.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some additional important notes:</font></p>
<ol>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you are selected for the move, all of
    your characters currently on Fennin Ro will be moved to the new server.
    Those characters will retain all of their equipment. We recommend that all
    characters settle any outstanding debts over the next few days.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">You will not receive any confirmation or
    feedback in regards to whether or not you have been moved. If you log on and
    find your characters missing from Fennin Ro, you will find them intact on
    the new server.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">CORPSES WILL NOT BE MOVED. If you have a
    corpse in the world, and you are moved, your corpse will not follow. Any
    equipment that was on the corpse will be lost and will not be subject to a
    reimbursement of any kind.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">As mentioned above, once you register by
    executing the /movelog command, it may not be revoked.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The move is one-way. If you are selected for
    a move, you will not be moved back.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">No special consideration will be made to
    keep groups or guilds together. It is recommended that you do not execute
    the /movelog command unless you are willing to risk separation from your
    friends.</font>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The GM/Guide Staff will not be able to tell
    you if you have or have not been selected, but should be able to clarify
    general information in regards to the move.</font></li>

Mistmoore says, 'Then who is the real demon here? You who would sacrifice all
that it is that you have fought your entire life for? All for information that
you only carry.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Think not lightly of your situation, child, as you covet
something that means nothing to you. Think of the price you would pay for
holding the secrets of nothing.'<br>
A pain filled cry echoes throughout the castle. Although forced with confidence,
each syllable the elf utters trembles with fear, &quot;I shall tell you
NOTHING!&quot;<br>
Whispering voices again fill the air, their gentle tones filled with sadness and
warning for the tortured elf. The whispers grow louder in a plea for mercy,
their thundering echoes roaring throughout the castle.<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Silence, fool. Mayong speaks!'<br>
Khasra Vei`Ras says, 'Show Lord Mistmoore some respect and back up!'<br>
Khasra Vei`Ras turns an icy glare upon Zivilyn.<br>
Roaring above the booming echoes, Mayong's voice shatters the eerie harmony,
&quot;SILENCE!&quot; The whispers fade and a still silence descends upon the
castle again.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore begins to cast a spell.<br>
Khasra Vei`Ras walks to Mayong, placing her hand upon his shoulder in suggestion
for him to lean down towards her.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore looks down at the beautiful Teir'Dal woman and raises his hand
to her cheek, &quot;Yes, my dear?&quot;<br>
Khasra Vei`Ras eyes the elf, still crouched upon the ground, a twisted sneer on
her face.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore raises an eyebrow in interest to Khasra Vei`Ras, &quot;Do
continue, my dear.&quot;<br>
Khasra Vei`Ras says, 'Forgive me if I offend thee milord, but the elven heart is
a difficult thing to destroy. Their pathetic faiths keep them from doing what is
in best judgment. However, I know of one weakness easily penetrated.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore raises an eyebrow in interest to Khasra Vei`Ras, &quot;Do
continue, my dear.&quot;<br>
Mayong Mistmoore laughs to himself, a sadistic grin adorning his face.<br>
Khasra Vei`Ras says, 'The council at Felwithe even holds a place within their
disgusting honor.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Of course my dear, you are the better half of my
judgment.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore turns his attentions back towards the elf, smiling gently at
his weakness.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Lord Galendore .'<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Yes, My Lord?'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Fetch me the boy's family as well as his mentor .'<br>
A wounded elf says, 'Wait!'<br>
A wounded elf raises his head and faces Mayong, his eyes begging for him to hear
his plea.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Now you wish to speak? Your time grows quite short,
boy.'<br>
A wounded elf breathing heavily, he looks to Mayong and those surrounding him,
pleading for assistance from the onlookers.<br>
A wounded elf says, 'What is it you wish to know?'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'The note, boy. The information of which you were
carrying to all the bardic stations around Norrath. Tell me all that you know
regarding what it is you are carrying.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore cackles madly.<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'ENOUGH!'<br>
Khasra Vei`Ras begins to cast a spell.<br>
Khasra Vei`Ras's casting is interrupted!<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'You are fools, you cannot harm me on my home grounds.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'I suggest you back off, before I slay you all.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore glares impatiently at the elf.<br>
A wounded elf says, 'What is it you wish to know?'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'The note, boy. The information of which you were
carrying to all the bardic stations around Norrath. Tell me all that you know
regarding what it is you are carrying.'<br>
A wounded elf says, 'You have what information I know, Mistmoore. You hold it
within your hand now.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore takes in a deep breath, glaring impatiently at the elf.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Do not play dumb with me, boy. I know the ways of your
kind. Tell me the truth, sing me your tales if you must, but do it swiftly as my
patience grows quite thin.'<br>
A wounded elf closes his eyes again, squeezing out the last tears of rage and
fear,<br>
A wounded elf says, 'I know nothing of what you speak, Mistmoore. I know only
what it is written within the note you hold now.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore paces quickly around the elf, starring down at him with a gleam
of disgust and impatience.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore pauses in his tracks, he turns an eye to Lord Galendore.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore nods at Lord Galendore.<br>
Lord Galendore grabs the wounded elf by the hair, forcing his head back into the
hilt of his sword.<br>
A pain filled cry soars through the castle as the interrogations of the captive
begin.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'The Dragons, boy. What is it that concerns them so that
they would drop their masks and be so open with their plans?'<br>
A wounded elf stands from the ground, his weak legs trembling with barely the
strength to hold his weight. The elf begins to speak through deep breaths.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore nods at the elf, turning his head away in disappointment and
irritation towards the elf's stubbornness.<br>
A wounded elf says, 'I know not of their plans nor of what you ask, Mistmoore. I
know only what I have written down.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'I believe that I have been as patient with you as needs
be. Perhaps we are in need of a new tactic.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore glares at the elf, a look of sadistic thought washing over his
expressions. Tilting his head slightly to the onlooking crowd, Mayong takes in
another deep breath, lowering his arms to his side.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Remember my words, child. Never call my bluff.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore looks into the crowd, quickly running them over with his eyes,
searching for one that appears to be of strength and innocence.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore grins evilly at Kotori.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'You shall do quite nicely.'<br>
Khasra Vei`Ras beams a smile at Mayong Mistmoore.<br>
Kotori cries.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore gazes into Kotori's eyes for just a moment, holding his hand
out in invitation.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore begins to cast a spell.<br>
Kotori shrinks away.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore smiles sadistically at the elf standing before him, motioning
his hand towards.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'You would endanger those whom you care for to protect
such information that is meaningless to you? Come child, I know that you wish
nothing more then for this to all fade away into the past'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'You have the power to grant yourself such wishes, but
you also have the power of life and death now residing on your shoulders.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'The choice is yours now, child as this is the last time
I will ask of you what information you cradle within your soul.'<br>
A wounded elf looks upon the innocent whom has fallen into the charm of
Mistmoore. Looking into Kotori's eyes, tears of regret and anger towards Mayong
begin to roll down his cheeks.<br>
A wounded elf says, 'I know of only one thing other than what is written within
the note.'<br>
A wounded elf heaves heavily, his throat moving as he swallows large gulps of
air, attempting to hold back his fury.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore smiles impatiently towards the elf, &quot;Do carry on, if you
would be so kind.&quot;<br>
Mayong Mistmoore grins evilly at Kotori.<br>
A wounded elf begins to breathe heavier and faster, his face flushed with his
fury as he glares between Mayong and his innocent captive.<br>
A wounded elf says, 'You are truly one of great cowardice, Mistmoore. Even if I
were to tell you the secrets which you feel are so important, you would not even
have the gall to stand up to prevent it yourself. You disgust me, Lord Mayong
Mistmoore.'<br>
A wounded elf spits at Mayong, almost standing in shock at what he had just
spoke and done.<br>
Lord Galendore raises his sword, swinging down sharply to the elf whom has
disgraced his master.<br>
A pain filled cry pierces through the still silence yet again, the whispers
quickly beginning to sing their song of regret and warning again to those who
would dare oppose their master.<br>
Lord Galendore Scores a critical hit!(69)<br>
Mayong Mistmoore raises his hand to Lord Galendore in motion for him to cease
his actions to the elf.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'No, Lord Galendore, the elf would not be so lucky as to
receive such a quick fate from your hands.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore raises his hand to his face, wiping away the bit of saliva from
his cheek with the back of his hand.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'There is an example to be made here. I am done playing
with your games, child.'<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Back off fools! I'll say it not once more!'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore looks to Kotori, their eyes clouded, staring out into a sea of
nothingness. Reaching down to them, Mayong grabs a hold of her hair, May your
conscience rest well, boy, with the death of this innocent now resting upon your
actions.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore raises his hand to Kotori's face, tilting their head to the
side as to expose their neck. Mayong's mouth agape and his fangs extended he
leans down to her throat.<br>
A wounded elf says, 'The Wurm Queen!'<br>
A wounded elf attempts to step forward with the intent to cease Mayong's
advances upon the innocent, but stumbles to the ground as all strength has
escaped his body.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore turns his head from Kotori's throat, raising an eyebrow towards
the now fallen elf.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'What of the Wurm Queen, child?'<br>
A wounded elf says, 'I do not know much about this. What I do know is the
dragons are weakening due to an ill maintained barrier created by the Wurm
Queen. I swear to you, I know nothing more.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore pushes his Kotori, his charmed victim aside, reaching out one
arm to the elf. Although not touching him, the elf rises as mayong lifes his arm
upward into the air.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore's feet leave the ground.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore begins to cast a spell.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore's casting is interrupted!<br>
Mayong Mistmoore begins to cast a spell.<br>
A wounded elf's feet leave the ground.<br>
A wounded elf says, 'The tale it mentioned something regarding a shard a shard

Mayong's voice roars across the castle, the tones of which he shouts being more
horrid then the most wicked of banshees. The castle itself, seeming to tremble
with the very might of the vampire lord's anger, &quot;Play no more games with

A wounded elf says, 'The tale it mentioned something regarding a shard a shard

A wounded elf says, 'Dragons to harness the powers from her realm again. That is
all I know, I swear it to you.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore hisses through clenched teeth, his face twisted with hate,
&quot;The veil...&quot;<br>
Mayong Mistmoore throws his arm down, forcing the elf to fall down to the
ground.<br>
A wounded elf feels a bit dispelled.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore sighs at A wounded elf.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore looks to Lord Galendore, a sadistic smile twisted upon his
face, &quot;Fetch me this boy's wife.&quot;<br>
A wounded elf says, 'No! P please I cooperated with you. She has nothing to do
with this please I was he who defiled you .'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Khasra, my dear, cease this boy's pathetic ramblings. I
grow tired of hearing his voice, but make sure you keep him alive. I wish for
him to learnat least one thing before he takes his leave off of the physical
world.'<br>
Khasra Vei`Ras grins evilly at Mayong Mistmoore.<br>
Khasra Vei`Ras begins to cast a spell.<br>
Khasra Vei`Ras's casting is interrupted!<br>
Mayong Mistmoore turns toward Kotori. &quot;Well my dear, it appears that I am
no longer in need of your services this eve. Fare the well.&quot;<br>
Kotori feels a bit dispelled.<br>
Kotori feels a bit dispelled.<br>
Kotori feels a bit dispelled.<br>
Kotori cringes away from Mayong Mistmoore.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Lord Galendore, a word?'<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Of course, Milord.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'With the events that are no doubt to be drawing upon us,
I will need you to perform a few outside duties within these next few days.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'No doubt, with the current disruption from their own
creator's realm, the Wurm's children will begin to assemble themselves. Find
what you can and any Wurms of which you encounter .'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Destroy them immediately'<br>
Lord Galendore bows before Mayong Mistmoore.<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'It shall be done, Milord.'<br>
Lord Galendore turns on his heels and begins to walk away from Mayong, towards
the entrance to the Lesser Faaydark forest.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'One more thing, Lord Galendore .'<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Aye, Milord?'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'I would advise that you gather some assistance. This is
not an easy task, and although I do not doubt your abilities, I do know their
limits '<br>
Lord Galendore nods at Mayong Mistmoore.<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Of course, Milord. There is a dwarf, one who is unlike
those of which inhabit this continent, someone of which has the same desires and
heart .'<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Or rather, lack thereof .'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Aye, I know of whom you speak and his ways. Engage his
services if you feel he can be trusted, but remember, if he fails, it shall be
you whom the consequesnces shall be dealt.'<br>
Lord Galendore bows before Mayong Mistmoore.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore cackles gleefully.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore begins to cast a spell.<br>
Mayong's voice fills the air, his tone enchanting and alluring as that of a
siren, &quot;I welcome you all to my home, as it is the first time in over a
century that I have seen the grotesque faces of mortal life.&quot;<br>
Kotori hugs Dreadwar.<br>
&quot;I thank you as well for your assistance in maintaining the... life blood
for my servants. For this eve, I bid thee all good night.&quot; His voice fades
into a faint whisper and then disappears into silence.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some
races are better at being certain classes than other races. That being true,

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the
same fashion, some classes do have inherently stronger abilities than others. A
paladin for instance has nearly the fighting abilities of the warrior, but they
also get spells. As such, they have lower hit points and inferior armor and
weapons. In addition, they also require more experience to level.</font>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">For
most part taking a cue that a hybrid is a combination of a warrior and something
else. Naturally this springs to mind that the hybrid will function as least as
well as a warrior with the additional abilities of being able to cast spells.</font>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">No.
There still has to be a compelling reason to play a warrior. &quot;Level

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">We
are always be made a tank. Which we do not do as well as the warrior. Fine, then
our spells are supposed to compensate for that. Fine- then why the experience
penalty ?</font>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I hope
I've answered the questions above to your satisfaction. To be completely frank,
regardless the points and discussions that come up, adjusting the amount of
experience required to level for any class isn't open for debate on our end. I'm
not trying to be smug or close-minded, just honest when I say that it is not

From the worlds core, the rock children rose,&nbsp; Shielded from wurms eyes by
dirt and stone.<br>
With gnarled hands and broken bones, they carved their place into Veeshans Home.<br>
Soon after, the woodlands and deserts and swamps.&nbsp; All nurtured life
planted by interloping Gods.<br>
Veeshan left her children, in peaks carved by her claws, turned her back on
Norrath, and her fellow Gods laws.<br>
The Crystalline Dragon content in her lair, Sealed off Sky and still slumbers
there.<br>
Some dragons went mad, apart from their queen, Others took charge and formed a
wurm ring.<br>
The rebels were hunted and sent from the peaks, To dwell in the lands inhabited
by the weak.<br>
One of these rebels a lady white as snow, Swept up a shard of nature unknown.<br>
As years dragged on one by one the wurms fell, Into a deep slumber from what no
one could tell.<br>
Their magic had faded, because of the shard? Or perhaps from the magic they call
Veeshans Veil.<br>
Now a new verse to this legend Ill share. In regards to the Sky and what is
happening there.<br>
Veeshan still slumbers, the veil has worn thin, The Wurm Queen neglect wakes her
children again.<br>
My song is done, but I will warn you to heed the words of my verse for the speak
the truth. Mortals now visit where Veeshan slumbers, and only dragons once
dwelled.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hey
folks :</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
Simply put, there aren't &quot;packet storms&quot; produced by EverQuest. BUT,
certain network conditions can perhaps look like that if you run the game under
a sniffer. We use UDP, but we have a reliable protocol built on top of it. The
reason for that is it's much harder to control the retransmit rate in TCP/IP.
You will find almost all network games are moving to UDP.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, how
do I explain the scenario that Tony showed? It's pretty easy.. let me explain :</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
the client zones or does something that needs guaranteed data (as in the case of
zoning or many other critical cases) and the network conditions get extremely
bad, the server keeps attempting to send the data at the normal retransmit rate.
Basically sometimes (and this happens much more often on Modems) things can back
up. I'm sure you've seen the PL meter rise, fall and then all of a sudden your
data rate (right hand side number) goes up for a bit. Thats exactly the symptom
here, except that TonySanders had that sort of symptom under a microscope. Those
of you that think there's a better way of handling this situation will have to
trust that we've looked very closely at this. The bottom line is that when you
HAVE to send something reliably, then it either needs to get there or error out.
In this case we have a certain amount of time that it attempts to retransmit and
then it gives up (that's when you get the &quot;You have been disconnected&quot;
message).</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for
Firewalls seeing strange things - Games like EQ that use UDP will cause
Firewalls to be alarmed because Firewalls aren't really geared for this sort of
thing.</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I hope
this answers the questions - btw.. sorry I didn't answer it before, I just
didn't notice the Thread.</font>

I forgot to mention an important part in my last message.</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
the server OR the client are attempting to retransmit packets, both sides resend
at a rate that is MUCH lower than what you see in Tony's log. What Tony's log is
measuring is when the data goes across his network, not when it's sent. So from
the server end, it could retransmit the same packet 2 times a second, but on his
end if it backs up for 20 seconds all of a sudden there could be a ton of
packets that hit him all at once.</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Again,
this only happens when network conditions become poor (mostly you will see this
happen on Modems, but it happens on Cable modems as well when PL starts to rise,
or when there are temporary latency spikes).</font>

&quot;official&quot; response. Anyway, given your two choices I'd have to answer
&quot;A&quot;. NPCs change in game. Places that may be safe one day may not be

<br>
As to the original authors assertion that the lich &quot;annihilates&quot; the
Totemic Helm Quest, I'd have to say that's false. Certainly, it has no more of
an effect on that quest than Sand Giants in Oasis have on croc-hunters.<br>

suggestion : PLEASE make Iksaur(sp?) skins and other animations for the
expansion available via &quot;Optional Patch&quot; at least a WEEK before Kunark
goes live. Once Kunark is live, make the skins mandatory.</font>
