Velious Subscribers<br>
<br>
Please run the &quot;Velious Patch&quot; off of the patch program.<br>
<br>
New Patch<br>
<br>
We appreciate everyone's continued patience over the past couple of days, and
are happy to see that the problems that have been experienced are relatively
minor compared to those of the past. Tonight's patch is expected to be the last
one we'll have to do for a while, so we hope to have you enjoying Velious over
the weekend non-stop.<br>
<br>
Today's patch corrects the following issues:<br>
<br>
- The user interface problems that occurred as of last night have been
addressed, such as window positioning and transparency. Also addressed were
problems with targeting, enabling and disabling windows, and switching to and
from resolutions above 1280x1024.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Corrected a problem that would cause some Voodoo card users to lock up when
killing giants.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Added messages for some new skills that some NPCs have (e.g. Rampage, and
Flurry).</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Fixed items and item drops in a number of zones.<br>
<br>
Enjoy your weekend!<br>
<br>
- The EverQuest Team</font></p>

been pretty busy in here…</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">However, Verant has said that the
aggro will not be cleared all the time. This has interesting effects:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">1) The groupmate will be pulled
out of the situation, but likely still in danger. Since the groupmate may still
be on the hate list, the mob may give chase or summon the groupmate back.&quot;</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yup</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">2) The mage and
groupmate can use CoH to pull a mob they otherwise could not pull.</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's this last one that's
interesting to me. Does Verant realize that this change will give groups with
CoH-equipped mages the ability to pull big mobs more easily? I think clearing
the hate list is the right thing to do. The mob believes the player to have
gated, unless the summoned player is within the normal aggro range of the
mob.&quot;</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, it could be used that way, I
suppose. But the chance of the hate list not being cleared is supposed to be
pretty low… it might be faster to pull it the normal way.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">And thanks for fixing
the pet suicide!</span></font>

I see Verant continuing the evocation path with magicians. This is
disheartening. We are conjurers. Let the wizards have their evocation. Long ago
I asked GZ why spells like &quot;Rain of Spikes&quot; were evocation. His
answer? Paraphrase: &quot;It was likely a mistake, but we can't change it now
since people may have based their specialization on it being evocation.&quot;
Sigh, I went to magician school. Mages should conjure heavy and sharp flying
objects rather than rely on fire so heavily IMHO. Why are so many of our spells
(with Kunark and current Velious spells) fire-based?</font></span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Umm… I dunno? I'm, again, not
really going to comment about Velious spells. But from reading the – oh so
excellent – Prima Strat Guide, it does suggest that magicians should either
specialize in conjuration or in evocation, and that many mages choose evocation.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Is that really how it should be? I
dunno. But GZ is right about it being a little late to change horses mid-stream.
I'll mention this comment to the folks here and let them think about it, though
for whatever is in Velious it's likely too late to fiddle with that.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Rain Spells<br>
<br>
Why do things that can't be affected by these spells reduce their effectiveness?
I'm a magician...I'm going to have a pet up nearly all the time. Why is it that
the rain loses a wave to my pet when my pet can't be harmed by the rain? Our
rain spells are efficient only when all waves have a chance to hit. We pay for
that efficiency with a resistance check on each wave and the risks of aggroing
more mobs with its AE nature. Totally losing a wave on our pet makes these
spells mana inefficient and is one of the main reasons they are not more heavily
used. If you can't &quot;fix&quot; the pet problem, would you consider making
the rain spells target only rather than AE? Again, the resistance checks on each
wave should balance the spells.</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's just as easy to argue the
other way, that pets should be damaged because they are obviously being hit by
the spell…</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The real way to look at this is
from the game mechanic point of view. Is having the pet take a wave making the
spell too weak? Would making him not hit make the spell too strong? Honestly, I
don't know. I do plan to bring this up, but probably not until after the
holidays. I know that's not fast enough, but it's as fast as it's gonna happen.
Verant deserves a holiday too…</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">PBAoE<br>
<br>
Thanks for Scintilation! I love frying those undead lowbies that think they can
gang up and melee me into the ground. This spell isn't useful for things my
level, but if it were, it'd overpower the class.</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cool. Thanks.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="background-color: #000000">DOT Spells<br>
<br>
I know, you won't talk about Velious...But with the CD gold and the release
around the corner, I thought you might speak a little more on the tpoc. Why are
we getting weak DOTs? I'm not a shaman or necro. I don't want to waste mana and
time on a DOT when I could do the same or more damage instantly.</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">The tradeoff for DOTs is typically
more damage, for more time. More time, same damage makes no sense to me. Shamans
can debuff a mob to lengthen the fight, giving their DOT time to work. Necros
can fear a mob, giving their DOT time to work. Magicians have no means of
lengthening a fight other than to cast more slowly. In fact, the longer a fight
continues, the worse shape magicians are in, typically.</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Please, reconsider DOTs...or make
them more powerful for the trade off of time.</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Umm… Let's wait on this. I'm
really, really not talking about Velious stuff.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Fun Spells<br>
<br>
Bristlebane's Bundle...ah...what a fun spell! Seriously, having a summoned party
pack is great! (You'd be surprised how many high levels I've tricked into
spinning themselves with the bottle, heh). A few Velious spells like this would
be great! In fact, as the DOTs are currently listed, take them all away. Give us
things we can have fun with...Voice Graft, anyone?&quot;</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm all for fun spells too. I'm
one of those people that tends to buy the fun spells first and worry about
combat spells later. Eye of Zomm rocks! Again, I'll make this suggestion to the
team, but it's probably too late to make any changes to Velious (I know, it
might not have been when you first posted…)</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Pet Graphics<br>
<br>
Rage of Zomm: Make it an eye...please? It would be something different to look
at that fits the Zomm line. We can't hand the Rage weapons anyway, so why make
it an elemental? Eyes are in the global file already, right?</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Very good idea.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">High Level Elementals:
We were told that there was no room in the global file. Sorry, mages. Spectres
yes, new elementals no. Ok, fine. Now there's 3 more gods in the global file
that I have yet to see in game. I guess gods have to be able to go to any zone.
Ok, fine. Sigh.&quot;</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Also a nice idea. I have no idea
how much space there is (or isn't) for new globals. I do know that enchanters
want some new stuff too. Both ideas are on my list.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Linkdeath<br>
<br>
Absor was incorrect in stating that it has always been the way it is now. In
fact, it was changed when it was discovered that people were banking summoned
arrows and food...or forcing linkdeath to save it (oh my!). I do not believe
that I should be able to summon the equivalent of dragon loot (a Treasure
Hunter's Satchel, for example). But really, did a few banked summoned items
throw off the game balance?</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">My inference is that Verant would
rather punish all magicians and shaman 100% of the time than risk a few percent
of players who are willing to linkdeath themselves to save summoned items. Isn't
there a solution that meets both ends? You've already prevented summoned items
from being banked. Put code into the /q and camp commands that trashes summoned
items in a player's inventory and leave it at that. If someone is willing to
physically disconnect a wire or reboot their machine in the middle of an EQ
session to save some arrows, let them! Or consider this option: make it a 10%
chance that things will poof on linkdeath...that will prevent people from using
the summoned bags to lug around all their good loot, yet give us a fair shot at
keeping our items most of the time.</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There have been several
suggestions for changes to the way linkdeath works with summoned items. Again,
it's on my list. Hopefully after the holidays we'll be able to tackle my growing
list…<br>
<br>
<span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF">Elemental Pets<br>
<br>
Earth and Air: Nice! Thanks!</font></span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yer weclome.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Water: I wish I could
say. Are you sure the drop has been fixed for 54 Water?</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So I have been told. But I haven't
taken it off my list yet…</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Fire: Argh! A 52 and 58
pet that casts low level spells, cancels debuffs, has a newbie fire shield,
gates and can't melee to save its life or mine? Verant has told us that we just
haven't found the right use for this pet. I'd bet I've logged more magician
hours than ANY Verant staffer, but perhaps I'm just dumb. Please, please,
please. Take a serious look at this pet! I don't know any magician who would
take the current pet over the existing, properly buffed 49 and under pet
model.</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Also on my list.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Power of Pets: We've
been told that our pets are more powerful than ever thanks to the DW bug fix a
year ago. What Verant fails to mention is that fire, air and water now hit as
slowly as earth. The differences in attack speed is now gone. Fire dished out
more damage before, allowing it to finish fights faster than earth, now it
doesn't. The differences in pets was narrowed greatly by this silent nerf. Just
a point to make that pet variety got narrower. Narrower is bad.</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Are you talking about the supposed
'nerf' that was supposed to have happened last week? I hate to repeat myself,
but there wasn't one… The reduction of the procing will certainly make pets a
bit weaker, even with the dual wielding change.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Decoy Pet<br>
<br>
This pet doesn't seem to be much of a decoy. As has been pointed out, it doesn't
taunt very well. The whole point behind this pet is to get mobs to lock onto it!
It should do that or it won't be useful.</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">On my list now (I'm sure you're
tired of hearing that by now).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Rage of Zomm<br>
<br>
This pet is interesting. It's at least some variety, although I'm convinced that
Zomm was a sissy mage that died at an early age. I wish this thing could survive
more than a single ripostle. Would you consider increasing it's health? Give it
half the health of an elemental. It is not dishing out twice as much damage as
an elemental, so this would not seem to overpower the pet. If not, would you
consider lowering the casting time to 2 seconds? Yes, 2 seconds. This would
allow us a chance at summoning a pet to distract something that's beating
us...even if not for very long.</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, I'll bring it up. I'm not
familiar with this pet, so I'll talk to someone about it.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Summoned Items<br>
<br>
&quot;Well, one man's junk...&quot; is a newbie's dream? Nope. It's junk to most
newbies too. The Sword of Runes is unqiue because of its proc. Other summons
that proc that level of damage would be awesome! It'd give me options. I don't
want to summon weapons that make warriors drool. What about weapons that proc a
small DoT? Weapons whose proc is a serious taunt? Weapons that make wood elf
women rain down from the sky?</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It may be a little while before we
start talking about new procing summoned weapons. I'll certainly let you all
know when we get to it, I'll probably ask for ideas.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Pet Heals<br>
<br>
I wish we had them when I was low enough for them to matter. They really added
some dimension to the class. Why not give us a high level heal? I can resummon a
pet in 10 - 12 seconds at 51+. Let me CH my own pet in 10 seconds for 500 mana.
That's a lot of mana...more than a cleric's CH (and of course, limited to the
pet). Now I have a choice. With 500 mana do I DD, try to summon a new pet or
heal my own?</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sounds interesting. Again, it's on
my list… (yikes)</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Buffs &amp; Stuff</span></font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">
Invisibility: Why didn't magicians get improved invisibility? Normally, we get
what other casters get with the exception of things like root and stun for which
we must rely on pets. However, my pets don't invis me (thankfully, since they'd
become despondent and suicide).</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Er… that's a Velious thing…
but my answer would be, I don't know…</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000">Phantom Armor: Woot!
Finally, a reason for casting it! Now, two things...can you make it use one of
something 4 times as expensive as the agate? No? What about one of something 10
times as expensive? I'd prefer that...most magicians 51+ would. Also, why does
Sheild of Words overwrite this? If you can't let me have both my Phantom Armor
and the cleric Shield of Words, then make Phantom Armor higher on the list so
the cleric gets &quot;Your spell did not take hold&quot; -- I hate losing my
armor to well meaning clerics.</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You mean you want it to cost more?
I don't know the current cost, so perhaps you're being sarcastic (and I hate
missing good sarcasm… Again, I'll ask about the stacking on this spell, and the cost, once I figure
out what you mean…</font>

I need a no drop rare from the Minions of Hate? Ack! The &quot;minion&quot; is
an 8-day timed spawn. He'll pop 45 times in a year (slightly more due to servers
going down and resetting the timer). The general consensus is that the staff is
dropped about 10% of the time. Ouch. Even if I can raise an army and get this
minion every time, it will take between 8 and 80 days with the average being in
the middle of that just to get this one item. Note the NPC says &quot;minions of
Hate&quot; ... was the drop to be moved from where it is to the minions of its
current owner?</span></font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've mentioned this elsewhere. The
'minions' thing is in there in anticipation of possible changes to Hate. Even
when (if) it is changed, the minions will not be easier to deal with than the

But if you had more than eight, yes, they would poof on death. There just
wouldn't be anyplace to put them.<br>
<br>
Yes, that could become a problem in the future. The team is aware of this (and
I'll make sure they don't forget, unless I forget…), and I'm sure they'll
figure out a solution before too long. A soulbound bag is a pretty good idea.<br>

1. in ALL Europe, products are produced and will reach stocks next friday<br>
2. street date is the 14th of Dec in FR / GR / SP / IT / AU / NL / SCAN<br>
3. street date is the 15th of Dec in UK only because in this country, releases
always happens on the friday, not thursday.<br>
4. in japan, the release date will happen the 22nd of Dec<br>
<br>
And here's another update after speaking further with our VP of Sales &amp;
Marketing:<br>
<br>
I wanted to add that we (SOE/Verant) did attempt a simultaneous release with
Europe but some errors were made on our side (was not UBIsoft) getting the right
materials over there, hence the delay. We apologize for the delay and will do
our best to do better next time.<br>

Patch Day<br>
<br>
Today's patch addresses a few issues brought up by players over the last several
days:<br>
<br>
- Fixed an issue with /split that would cause people to go linkdead in the event
that they used the command in quick succession.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
- Fixed a bug where you could not edit socials or skills (via the hotbutton
window right click) in fullview mode if you had hidden your &quot;MainMenu&quot;
window.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
- Fixed a bug where you would not see hotbuttons in &quot;normal&quot; mode if
you had hidden that window in fullview mode.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
- Fixed it so you can't use hotbuttons when looting, trading, banking, or using
a merchant in fullview mode (which is how it is in normal mode, but with the
inventory working in fullview mode now it wasn't blocked properly for that).</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
- Fixed the message for the /dynamiclights command to report properly.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
- Fixed a problem where INI setting were not being read properly if you had
camped or went LD to server select then reentered the game. This was causing
various UI problems with window positions and colors being wrong.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
- Fixed a problem with Sirens Grotto - Some people entering the zone were
getting stuck.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
- Fixed a problem with passage from Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar. Travel in that
direction was supposed to require a key.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
- We believe we fixed a problem where NPCs sometimes would hit a pet-owner no
matter how far away the owner was from the pet and the NPC.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
- Corrected loot drops in Thurgadin<br>
<br>
We again appreciate patience while we stabilize following Velious launch.<br>

Velious Patch<br>
<br>
Today's patch requires that Velious subscribers press the &quot;Velious
Patch&quot; button on the patch program UI.<br>
<br>
<br>
Emergency Patch<br>
<br>
We appreciate everyone's patience while we address a few issues as tens of
thousands of new players check out Velious. This emergency patch addresses
several issues:<br>
<br>
- The transparent inventory screen will no longer come up in 640x480 resolution.
It was not supposed to come up as the available screen space is not large enough
to house the new screen.<br>
<br>
- &quot;Disabled&quot; windows in full screen mode will no longer interfere with
mouse clicks.<br>
<br>
- Addressed some item drop bugs in Skyshrine that had the highest-level loot
dropping off of yard fodder. This has been addressed with a retroactive item
change. We apologize for the inconvenience.<br>
<br>
- Several disciplines (Resistant, Trueshot, Unholyaura, and Holyforge) have been
upgraded. Please read the updated EQManual_Supplement.doc (or .txt) in your
EverQuest Directory.<br>
<br>
- &quot;Dragon Circles&quot; have been fully implemented. In short, you will not
be able to receive a teleport to a dragon circle unless you've been to the
circle before and carry a soulbound souvenir that spawns at the circle. Please
read the updated EQManual_Supplement.<br>
<br>
- Innate class-based resistances implemented a year or so ago did not take into
account levels 50 through 60 with exception to those provided to the warrior. As
such, each class that has class-based resistance bonuses (with exception to the
warrior) will get an additional bonus as they level from 50 to 60.<br>
<br>
- The problem of blank faction messages being reported to the players has been
corrected.<br>
<br>
- Screenshots are again enabled.<br>
<br>
Overall the Velious launch is going very well. We are happy to see that the
problems found so far are minor and that we can address them quickly.<br>
<br>

Continued Velious Preparations<br>
<br>
Please be patient with us over the next few days.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
As Velious goes live we are expecting to be very busy, both on the servers and with tech support.  We will be doing everything we can to keep things running smoothly for everyone.  But if something untoward happens, please understand that our staff will be working hard to help you out.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We are anticipating a rather large increase in volume on the servers, in petitions and on our tech support phone lines.  Velious is an exciting new adventure for everyone, with people rushing out to see the new lands.  Servers will probably see a lot more activity than they are used to, and they already see a lot.  So will our customer support personnel.  Please, be patient with them during this busy time.<br>
<br>
And happy holidays to everyone!<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yup,
that should be the spell (I didn't list which one mostly because I don't know
all of them...)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
But what happens is that pets under 36 will be boosted to 36, the level range
was not moved up.&nbsp; So, basically, the range is now something like 36-37.&nbsp;
:)<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I think most mages will resummon to get the most powerful one anyway, when they
have time.&nbsp; We changed it because we thought it was rather silly to see one
spell get such a dramatically different power in their pets.&nbsp; Yes, it will
make mages and necros a bit more powerful at those levels.&nbsp; *shrug*&nbsp;
It was such a glaring difference in power from 35 to 36 that it felt silly to
leave it that way.<br>
