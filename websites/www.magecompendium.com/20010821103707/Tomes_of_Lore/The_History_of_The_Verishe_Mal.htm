<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fear not my brethren!&nbsp; We have taken this
home and we shall make it our own!&nbsp; Use what resources we have to establish
ourselves here.&nbsp; Care not about the Theth, for they are our inferiors.&nbsp;
Use their goods, use their services, and use their skins if need be.&nbsp; In
time, we shall feel our former glory!&nbsp; Ishk kal hobra!</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Volume 1 'History of the Verishe Mal'&nbsp; We
were forged from the Earth by the hands of our lord, Brell Serillis.&nbsp; He
molded us into an image that suited him, and we were glad.&nbsp; Such is our
roll to learn and expand, and be one with the underworld.&nbsp; We were born to
know many things, and we shall.&nbsp; Our lord told us that we suffered not the
curse of the others, and for this, we are grateful.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Volume 2 'History of the Verishe Mal'&nbsp; Our
forefathers gave us many tasks to better us.&nbsp; We learned the way of the
sword, and the way of magiks.&nbsp; Each test we proved victorious, and for a
time, quite prosperous.&nbsp; In time, we grew to be a large race, riddled with
a rutheless empire that spanned many a mile.&nbsp; Our worth was broken down
into a caste system, and many were made slaves.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Volume 3 'History of the Verishe Mal'&nbsp; The
Verishe Mal were then ruled by the Ishva Mal, a hard and stern ruler.&nbsp; In
the old tongue, Ishva meant Supreme and Mal meant ruler.&nbsp; Beneath the Ishva,
there were the Rosch, and the Tesch, the caster and warrior caste.&nbsp; Above
the Rosch and the Tesch were the Nisch, the spiritual leaders of the Verishe
Mal.&nbsp; Shortly after the abolishion of the old ways and the Ishva, the Nisch
Val formed a council of nine, which still rule us to this day.</font></p>
