<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Charasis (Howling Stones) : City of The Kunzar</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nestled deep in the plains of the Overthere
rests the cliff city of Charasis. This city of grandeur was home to the mightiest
of all Iksar tribes, the Kunzar.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Charasis is also recorded as the birthplace of
the great Emperor Venril Sathir the uniter. Although Emperor Sathir ruled from
the Kunazar city of Sebilis, he was rumored to have stored his most valuable possessions
within the library of Charasis.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Emperor Sathir's beloved, Drusella, rests
within a grand crypt in Charasis' depths. After her funeral and burial, Emperor
Sathir cast all citizens from the cliff city. Only the royal guard and servants
where allowed to stay, forever.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These Iskar were never again to feel the warmth
of the sun or bask in the moonlight. It is written that Emperor Sathir craftted
a spell to hide the entrance of Charasis from raiders and those who dared to
steal his knowledge and defile his beloved Drusella's crypt. Emperor Sathir
would visit the cliff city frequently. What he would do inside is not known.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Upon the death of one of Emperor Sathir's royal
guard was revealed the secret to gaining entry into Charasis. Upon a tattered
scroll did the guard record the secret. The scroll is now lost to the world.
Taken as pure babble by the mortician, it was cast aside and lost to time.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">After Emperor Sathir's death his son and new
emperor, Rile is the last to hold the secret of entry. The ancient cult of
Emperor Sathir known as the The Arisen are rumored to have acquired the lost
scroll of the royal guard. They are said to care for the crypt of the late
Emperpr Sathir.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was during the time known as the End Days
that the spirits of Tunare, Underfoot and the Rainkeeper destroy most of the
great cities of the ancients. Charasis and it's guardians and treasures are lost
forever. May those entombed within guard her secrets from invaders.</font></p>
