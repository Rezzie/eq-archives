<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.1 What is a FAQ ?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">FAQ stands for Frequently Asked
Questions. FAQs are designed to cover the most common questions and answers
regarding a product.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.2 What is EverQuest: The Ruins
of Kunark ?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The EverQuest Expansion Pack is
essentially an add-on to the massively multiplayer game EverQuest.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.2.1 What is EverQuest ?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EverQuest is a real 3D massively
multiplayer online RPG. Another equally accurate way of describing EverQuest is
to call it a graphical MUD. EverQuest was released March 16, 1999.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.2.2 When will EverQuest: The
Ruins of Kunark be released ?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our target release date is April 24, 2000.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.3 What are some of the main
features of the Expansion ?</font></b></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">An entire new continent, called
    Kunark, located south of Faydwer.</font>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font face="Verdana" size="2">20+ Brand New Zones, including
    newbie zones all the way up to zones filled with dragons.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font face="Verdana" size="2">A huge array of new, even more
    visually stunning NPCs.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font face="Verdana" size="2">A more detailed world, using
    more polygons and larger textures.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font face="Verdana" size="2">More animation of objects
    throughout the new continent.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font face="Verdana" size="2">New Playable Race, the Iksar
(Lizardman).</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font face="Verdana" size="2">Lizardmen are neutral/evil and
    can be Monks.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font face="Verdana" size="2">New ships will sail from both
    Antonica and Faydwer to Kunark.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font face="Verdana" size="2">New cover and box art by famous
    fantasy artist Keith Parkinson.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"> <font face="Verdana" size="2">The ability for players to
    exceed the previous level 50 limit.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.4 Will there be a beta test
for the Expansion? If so, when will it begin and how many people will it involve
?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Closed beta testing is beginning the week of February 14th and will involve a
small group of external testers on an invite-only basis. We anticipate between
50 and 200 external testers to be involved in this process -- we will bring in
additional testers as needed. Testers will primarily be chosen from the pool of
players who already play on the Test server and regularly help out in the
testing process.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.5 What opportunity will
existing EverQuest customers have to upgrade to the Expansion ?</font></b></p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">All existing EverQuest customers will
be given the opportunity to upgrade to the Expansion directly (via the Login
server) and at a discounted upgrade-only rate. This opportunity will most likely
happen during the month of April, prior to launch. The upgrade package will
include an upgrade CD-ROM and a new world map.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><font color="#FFFFFF">IMPORTANT :</font> The retail EverQuest box will be replaced with a new box that will
include both EverQuest and the Expansion. You may have already begun to see
advertisements for this box at a regular retail price. If you are already an
existing EverQuest customer you do NOT need to purchase the box at retail -- you
will be given an opportunity to buy an upgrade only package directly and at a
discounted price.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pricing for the upgrade will be announced shortly.</font>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.5.1 Will purchase of the
Expansion affect the monthly subscription rate ?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.5.2 What if I don’t purchase
the Expansion ?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You will still be able to play
EverQuest as usual. You will be able to view characters of the new race and
trade/purchase new items from Kunark, but you will not be able to create an
Iksar character yourself nor will you be able to travel to Kunark.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.6.1 Will the graphical
upgrades used in the Expansion affect the rest of the EverQuest world ?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No. To take advantage of the
advanced techniques used in the creation of the Expansion we would have to
completely recreate the older EverQuest zones, and we’ve made the decision to
focus our resources on new content instead.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1.6.2 Will Kunark Allow More
Character Slots ?</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No. Kunark is an expansion to the
existing game. It contains landmass, content, and an additional race. The core
game of EverQuest really isn't changing as a result of it exept to include
quests related to Kunark and the boats to get there. Hence, the 8 character
limit per server won't change as a result of the expansion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.0 EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark Product FAQ</b></font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.0.1 What is the Kunark Expansion Pack
  Upgrade ?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Upgrade allows current EverQuest
  subscribers the ability to access the new features of the Ruins of Kunark.
  Such new features include the continent of Kunark with 20+ brand new zones as
  well as a new playable race the Iksar. The Upgrade comes with a Kunark CD,
  Upgrade Account Key, and a cloth map of the EverQuest world including the new
  continent. The Upgrade key will allow an existing EverQuest subscriber to
  access the Ruins of Kunark and enjoy all the new features.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.0.2 What is the difference between the
  Kunark Upgrade and the retail Kunark Box Edition ?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Kunark Box Edition includes both the
  EverQuest and Kunark software as well as an Account Key allowing for the
  creation of a new EverQuest account. The Upgrade only includes the Kunark
  software and an Upgrade Account Key that allows existing players access to the
  Ruins of Kunark. If you are not currently an EverQuest customer we recommend
  you purchase the Kunark Box Edition.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.1 Will I need to order the Upgrade to keep
playing EverQuest ?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No. You can still play EQ, but you won't have
access to the new continent or the new playable race.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.2 Who can order the Kunark Expansion Pack
Upgrade ?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All active EverQuest subscribers. Players that
once had an account, but cancelled service will need to re-subscribe before
being able to access the EverQuest Store.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.3 What is the EverQuest
Store ?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The EverQuest Store is an area ONLY accessible
from within the EverQuest software at the foyer screen. Players will be able to
purchase the Kunark Expansion Upgrade from the EverQuest store. In the future we
hope to offer other EverQuest products.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.3.1 How do I purchase the Kunark Upgrade or
  access the EverQuest Store ?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once the Kunark Upgrade is available, a pop
  up window will appear the first time you login announcing it's available and
  offer you the opportunity to purchase it. If you don't elect to purchase it
  immediately, it will be available via the Store button on the Server Selection
  screen thereafter. Once in the store, follow the on screen instructions. Be
  advised that you are limited to one Upgrade per EverQuest account.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.3.2 What payment methods are offered in the
  EverQuest Store ?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A credit card or compatible debit card (most
  banking cards with a Visa or MasterCard logo) is required for making purchases
  from the EverQuest Store. Due to limitations in the billing system, you will
  need to use the same credit card or compatible debit card for your EverQuest
  subscription as well as store purchases. If you don't remember which card you
  are using for your EverQuest subscription, don't worry. The Store will allow
  you to update your subscription card number to match the one used for
  EverQuest store purchases The EverQuest Store will only be accepting Visa,
  MasterCard, Discover, or American Express. No other forms of payment will be
  accepted.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.3.3 Why does the store need my email
  address ?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We use the email address to send you an
  invoice receipt on a successful purchase or a notification that we couldn't
  successfully bill your account. It's important that you give us a correct
  email address since this is the only way we can notify you if your purchase
  didn't go through.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.3.4 When will my order be
  filled ?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We will process your order within 1-2
  business days of receiving it. The shipping option you choose will determine
  when you receive the software. Please note that even if you ordered the Kunark
  Upgrade before 4/11/00</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.3.5 What types of shipping options are
  available ?</b></font></p>

  offer both ground and next day/ shipping options. Ground shipping should take

  customers depending on customs delays while US next day customers should see

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.4 Once I get the Kunark package, what do I
do ?</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Install the Kunark software off the CD then
register for the Kunark service using the account key on the CD. Remember that
if you purchased the Kunark Updgrade, your key can only update and existing
EverQuest account. You can update your account from the server selection screen
by clicking Register Kunark, or by going to the account, change account menus.
If you purchased the full Retail version of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark you
may use your key to either create a new EverQuest account with both EQ and
Kunark access, or update an existing EQ Account. BUT YOU CANNOT DO BOTH.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><b>2.4.1 I keep getting &quot;invalid account
  key&quot; errors when trying to register. What should I do ?</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sometimes zeros can be confused with o's and
  I's can be confused with 1's. With the font used on the key labels, remember
  that o's appear angular (kind of like diamonds) and zero's look more
  rectangular. Try the combinations. If you still have trouble, contact customer
  service for help.</font></p>
