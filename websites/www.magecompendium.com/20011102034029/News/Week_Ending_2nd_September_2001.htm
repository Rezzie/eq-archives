message boards.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Before going into the Ask Brads I
received, I wanted to first post this email I received about the trivial loot
code and Luclin:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">It completely
destroys the role-playing feel of the game. It is also not farming to go get a
specific item that you wish to wear from a lower level zone and then leave.
Since I have played pretty much since the beginning, I was one of those people
who killed for everything I wear and readily recognize that wearable equipment
choices are very hard to come by. Any lower level item that is farmed now is due
to a mistake in its placement or a mistake in not having another choice of
similar equipment, farming is a very, very rare problem for anyone and can
always be handled by your play nice policy anyway. I am also a very average
player . A 34 year old truck driver that works full time and have my characters
at high level and in a good guild through time played and being a good group
member. I really think you should ask what everyone thinks, if an average player
thinks the trivial code is awful you might just have made a bad mistake.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good points. What we're trying to
do is twofold:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Stop a small minority of high
level players from storming into low and mid level zones at launch and then
publishing all the treasure to spoiler sites. Yes, we know that will happen
anyway, the information coming from level appropriate players, but it will
happen more slowly. Right now, when we revamp or launch a new zone, it's filled
with lookey-loo high level players who just blast everything. This inhibits the
appeal of exploration and discovery for the players for whom the zone was
designed. For example, when we re-vamped Runnyeye, this is exactly what
happened. And while there were still some players who went into the Warrens and
Stonebrunt and blasted everything, they didn't get any significant loot and
therefore couldn't talk much about it.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. The loot code should hopefully
allow us to put some decent items in low and mid level zones. Now, an important
point is this: the items will still be measurably less powerful than those found
in tougher, high level zones. Also, the items will probably not hold much appeal
for mid level players on very old servers due to the fact that better items are
available because of the trickle down nature of the economy. But, we are trying
to make a better, more interesting EverQuest, and we think the loot code will
contribute to this, especially on newer, younger servers.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One of your points is that heavy
bottom-feeding farming only occurs if the item is in a low or mid level dungeon
and is still attractive to the high level player because there is no better item
in a higher level zone. This is an excellent point, and when these instances
occur, we should correct them (by either moving the item if it's too powerful,
or by putting a better item in a higher level zone that is equivalent in
nature).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our plan with Luclin is to make
sure there are more attractive items for high level players so that they won't
feel they 'need' to adventure in zones that are too low level for them. If we
can accomplish that, then, in my opinion, there would be no legitimate reason
for a higher level player to be blasting mobs in a low or mid level zone, and
therefore the loot code will interfere with very few players' enjoyment of the
game. (By the way, I've seen the argument that the high level player has the
'right' to enjoy all content in the game and therefore has equal rights to be in
the new zone as another player for whom the zone was designed and populated -- I
must respectfully disagree -- the character who is in a zone designed for his
level range should have the right of way).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are aware this is a
controversial issue, but honestly, I think most of the controversy comes from
the fact that we've inadequately explained how the system will work, why we're
doing it, and who it would really affect. I've received many emails and read
many posts regarding the subject, and there are players who are both for and
against the system. Going forward, Absor and I will attempt to better explain
the system.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I will say that I'm generally
against making any sweeping changes to the game because disrupting the status
quo of a game more than two years old is not usually a good idea. When we do
make big changes (for example, removing the class based experience penalties)
it's typically after a lot of thought and consideration and after concluding
that, overall, the change would make a better EverQuest long term. If we are
unable to communicate the benefit of this new code in Luclin to most of our
players, we will reconsider it.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">In one of the 'Ask
Brad' columns someone asked the question about 'Are you doing the moon of
Norrath because you have run out of continents to add?' Your answer was along
the lines of 'There is a globe in skyfire mountains, check that out.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Well I was porting
someone to Skyfire the other day and thought I'd study the globe, because I was
sure there was undiscovered continents. I was right, directly on the other side
of the world from Antonica is a land mass about the size of the original EQ
game, also with a couple of small islands between it and Odus. So that would
answer the question of 'If the world is round how come I can't go from Odus to
Faydwer/Kunark?' 'Because there is a big chunk of land you don't know about
yet.'</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">But what I would
like to know is (and I know you'd have a slight idea by now), will this last
continent be expansion number 4? (Don't suppose I'll get an answer for that
one.) Or I guess you could even make this the setting for EQ2. At least then
people would be familiar with the world and could leave some sort of connection
between the first and second generation EverQuest.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You’re right, you won’t get
much of an answer because it’s simply too early to talk about unannounced
titles or products that ‘might’ happen. What I can say is this: we think
EverQuest has a very bright future ahead of it and we intend to turn the game
and the world into a franchise – in other words, we are very committed to
EverQuest for the long term.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">To that end, we’ve thought about
and planned all sorts of stuff as it relates to Norrath and the universe it’s
in. The globe you saw is just one example of how there might be more to the
world than most people think. Our opening of one of Norrath’s moons in the
Shadows of Luclin is another. And trust me, we’ve got all sorts of crazier
ideas too</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Let's take a quick
look to the future:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">EQ Q4 2002 -
500,000 Subscribers (optimistically) - 100,000 Level 60 players</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">With a level cap
like you have (and I do see the need for it) everyone who keeps playing will get
to level 60 eventually, some with multiple characters. For them the game is
pretty much played out until whatever new zone or super quest is added. Are
there far reaching plans of some sort to keep players who reach level 60?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Some idea's that
I'd like your view on:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Upping the level
cap and adding more content (basic and boring)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Continually adding
Level 60 only quests and goals as were hinted would be in SoL (would require
constant additions - likely twice monthly)</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Starting a new
'Dimension' of play... where characters who reach level 60 can move to another
EQ dimension. Based on their current class they would be able to choose a new
class only available in this new dimension. The new class could be levels
60-100.. or could start at level one. In either case the character would keep
it's old classes skills, spells, and such and be able to add on top of that the
skills, spells, and such from this new class. (Complicated to implement and
requires a lot of content up front - basically a whole new game).</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Thoughts?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think your concern will
eventually be valid, and you’ve got some neat ideas on how to address the
issue. While I can’t reveal in details as of yet, I will say that we are also
thinking about the future as it relates to where the majority of our player base
is at and where it will be. And we are working on ideas to address this. Sorry I
can’t be more specific at this time.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Every time there
is talk of Veeshan at least five people refer to the original video with Veeshan
in it, saying she is larger than a planet. They said it was on the original
game. I bought Kunark and maybe I missed it, but where can I download that
video? I mean I am sure you guys have an archive of old trailers and videos you
have, but I guess I can't find the link.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If I recall correctly, since the
Kunark CD-ROM has both the Old World and Kunark on it, the intro movie
wouldn’t fit. I will bring up the idea of making it available somehow, but I
doubt it will be via download, because the movie is several hundred megabytes.
I’ll bring up the idea of resurrecting it somehow on Trilogy, or Luclin, or
perhaps some future product if people seem interested in seeing it.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I'm a big
EverQuest fan and have been playing the game for about 3 months now.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have a few
questions/comments that I'm really hoping you answer. I've voiced them on
several forums but never received an 'official' response. So here goes:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">1) Are there any
plans to introduce any interactive, non-combat related activities in EQ? By this
I'm talking about things like darts and chess games in the taverns; the ability
to use stools and chairs in the taverns, etc. One of he things that have
disappointed me about EQ is that there seems to be so little activity in the
cities not related to questing or selling loot or fighting. It might be nice to
have something else to do but play GEMS by yourself. I think that may be a
neglected aspect of EverQuest had been in this area. It seems that when I play I
find myself pushed into hunting and fighting just because no one else is doing
anything else.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I sure hope so, but I think
they’ll be added slowly, over time. They’re not easy to implement, but I do
think they’d add a lot to the game. Here’s some interesting trivia: we had
intended on making a cards mini-game (called King’s Court) in the casinos in
Highpass Hold – you can still see the textures there, where we had planned on
doing this. One day it’s my hope that we are able to implement this and other
mini-games.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">2) Are we ever
going to see a graphical overhaul of the original EverQuest continents and not
just player characters when you buy expansions?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, in the past I know I’ve
said no, but now I’m going to upgrade that ‘no’ to a ‘maybe’.
Unfortunately, it’s too early to say more, but stay tuned</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I was wondering if
any free zones will be added to Kunark or Velious, instead of the old world
continents in the future?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Quite possibly, yes. One I’d
really like to see is Veksar, which should be a completely underwater zone
similar to Kedge Keep – I’d like to see more underwater zones in the future
because they require such different strategies when adventuring there. Veksar,
by the way, is (or would be) deep in the Lake of Ill Omen.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Hi! I was
wondering if all the gnomes will be changed. I was looking at some of the models
and I really don’ like those bald gnomes. When I think of gnome, I usually
think of small skinny old man, but the new looks were more of a bald halfling.
Please tell me you're going to keep some of the old looks, or at least very
similar, just with better graphics maybe? Thanks.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Good question, to which I have two
responses:</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, the screenshots of the new
gnome had no hair because you’ll actually be able to configure hair to an
extent on the new Luclin player characters – so they won’t all be bald.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Secondly, we understand that there
will still be some players who prefer the older models, and so you will be able
to configure your client to display either the old character models or the new.
At this point in our planning, it will be a global change – you’ll either
see all of the new models or all of the old.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have a question
about when you look at what we're doing. I know that GM's often pop up to look
around, check things out, etc. But I've always wondered, can you check out
what's going on without creating a character? Can you, for instance, view what's
going on in a given room or area like you're watching TV? I think that would be
so cool to watch!</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even GMs have to be characters –
there’s no way to enter Norrath without one. That said, GMs are able to be
completely invisible, and to fly, and to look through the eyes of other
characters.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Hi, I have been
playing an enchanter for a very long time. I enjoy the selection of illusions
that I can cast. Just wondering if it possible to have ‘illusion froglok’? I
think this would be loads of fun, to be able to hop like they do. And to be able
to do a back flip when casting.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Neat idea, but to be able to do
so, we’d have to add the Froglok model to the global character file (like we
did with the Spectre). Most NPCs are only loaded into your computers memory when
you enter a zone in which they are found. I’m not sure we have the room to be
able to do this, but we’ll certainly toss the idea around.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Interesting
comments from you as usual, but one of them really saddened me.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">You say you plan
to revamp a number of the underused mid-level dungeons for high-level use.
Unfortunately, I am sure this is inevitable and that your decision has been
made.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">By the time Luclin
comes out, I will have been playing EQ for over two years. I play at least 30 to
40 hours most weeks - playing EQ has been my main leisure interest over the last
couple of years. (Fortunately it's my girlfriend's main hobby too). By that
reckoning, I should have at least one very high level character and probably two
or three.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I don't. My
highest is a 51st druid, who I very rarely play. Next after that are two in the
mid 30s and then a whole lot in the teens and 20s.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Quite simply, the
whole high-level game is completely unappealing to me. I found even the 40s to
be too high-level - too far from anything I can associate with. Take away the
fantasy trappings and the magic, and the struggles of a character up to about
30th level are pretty believable. After that, though, they just get sillier and
sillier, more exaggerated and fantastic.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Unlike the
experience you recount, when I first found out there were dragons in the game I
was disappointed, although not half as disappointed as when I heard about the
planes. I have never been on a raid to either and never intend to.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">There are still
many mid-level dungeons in which, after two years, I have never hunted. Even
playing 30 or 40 hours a week, there's an awful lot of Norrath to get through
and I have yet to hunt in Sol, Cazic Thule or Dalnir, to name but three.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Partly that's
because I like some zones and dungeons so very much I keep creating new
characters to experience them again and again - after all, it's different every
time with a different class or race.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Now, I realise
there will be new low and mid-level zones in Luclin, but that doesn't make up
for losing the old ones.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I do appreciate
that many players require new content constantly, but I don't have their craving
for novelty. Every day on Norrath is entirely different to me - I make and
manage my own content.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I appreciate that
there can never be stasis in an MMORPG and as I said, I am sure you have already
made this decision and won't be swayed. I can't even suggest an alternative and
I'm sure my opinion is a minority one. Nevertheless, I felt I had to let you
know how sad this news made me feel.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Inasmuch as the
game needs its legends, it also needs its traditions and some of the low and
mid-level dungeons are the backbone of those traditions. I am very sorry that
because I've perhaps been enjoying the game too much, I have progressed too
slowly to see everything I wanted to before it turns into something else.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I do hope, though,
that some things remain sacrosanct and we won't see any major changes to the
classic low-level dungeons which are heavily used. The thought of beginning a
new character and not being able to hunt in Blackburrow or Crushbone - well it
doesn't bear thinking of.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Excellent email, thank you. And
you are certainly not alone – there are a lot of players who enjoy the low and
mid level game more than the high.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I probably wasn’t as clear as I
should have been in my earlier Ask Brad regarding this issue. Our intent is to,
over time, revamp the older low and mid level dungeons that just aren’t very
popular. In general, our priority would be to keep the level range pretty close
to what it was. But in some cases, for a variety of reasons (location, layout,
etc.), just making the zone more interesting or putting new treasure in it
isn’t enough. Those dungeons we will probably upgrade to higher level zones.
For example, off the top of my head, Paw and Droga/Nurga. For their level range,
they’re just too remote and/or the layout is too difficult.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This certainly doesn’t mean,
however, that we’re abandoning the low and mid level player. You have our
commitment that we’ll continue to provide hopefully interesting content for
you. I think, in fact, that the Warrens and Stonebrunt Mountains as well as the
recently revamped Runnyeye are a pretty good indicator of that commitment.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I hope that ‘un-saddens’ you</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I own Kunark, but
not Velious... When SoL comes out, will I need to purchase Velious first, or
does SoL come with Velious, or is Velious not needed for SoL?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No, you won’t need to purchase
Velious first. In fact, you don’t even need to own Kunark. Just having the Old
World is enough to upgrade to Luclin.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">How much of a
player's armor will be visible in SoL? I've heard just about everything but I
need some first hand info.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I wouldn’t say ‘everything’,
but I would say a lot more. Not only that but wearing armor shouldn’t just
change the textures on your character – you should see geometry changes (the
shape of your character will actually change), which we’re very excited about.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">When I got
EverQuest, I picked up the Small Box version, since my computer would get about
3 fps in Kunark. I've since upgraded my computer, and considered getting the
Velious and Kunark expansions, but was disappointed to find that I would need to
buy them separately. I was wondering: Are there any plans for a
Kunark+Velious+Luclin expansion box that the Small Box version players can buy
to get all the expansions at once?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We do plan to launch EverQuest:
Trilogy shortly, which will include the Old World, Kunark, and Velious. Luclin
will, however, remain a separate product, requiring at least the purchase of the
Old World first. We do want accommodate different combinations as much as
possible, but we can’t have too many products on the shelf, lest it
potentially confuse customers.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Anyway, my real
question was, since SoL is going to introduce revamped character models, will it
also introduce revamped spell graphics? Things like area-effect spells actually
having the area ignite in flame or whatever, or buffs illuminating the character
in an aura rather than just having sparkly things fly around them. If you've
ever played Final Fantasy 7 or 8, you know the sort of potential that special
graphics (and sound!) effects can reach, and it's high time that the spell
graphics code gets a dusting-off as well.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We’re not sure yet, but we are
going to try. We’ve wanted to upgrade our particle effects engine for some
time, but whether we’ll get it done by Luclin or not remains to be seen. While
I think we do have some excellent spell effects and such, I do agree it could
even be more spectacular.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Will the new Umbra
technology in Luclin cut down on zone loading time at all?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No, Umbra doesn’t really have
anything to do with the size or amount of content in a zone, which is what
determines its file size and therefore its loading time. To be honest, the
Luclin zones will probably take more time to load than older zones because
we’re putting so much more detail into them. The textures are richer and
higher resolution, the number of polygons and the general detail level much
greater, and the indoor zones are larger than they’ve ever been.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The best thing you can do to
improve zone loading times is to increase your system’s RAM and/or the speed
of your system’s hard drive – both will generally help dramatically.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thanks once again for all of your
emails and I’ll talk to you all again soon!</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">There is a new,
fairly involved quest, in the Stonebrunt Mountains. It appears to be a fairly
interesting quest, and I'm hoping that the end result is nice, although its
still too early to say at this point. There are, however, some problems that I'm
seeing with it.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The problem
revolves around the trivial loot code, unfortunately. The quest requires players
to retrieve items from the Tower of Frozen Shadows, a zone in Vellious that is
appropriate for players from roughly level 30 to level 40. The quest also
requires players to loot items from the spiritlings in the Stonebrunt Mountains.
Unfortunately, the level on these creatures is low enough that your typical
player who can actually visit the Tower of Frozen Shadow and retrieve one of the
needed items is probably not going to be able to get what he or she needs from
the spiritlings due to the trivial loot code.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">There is also an
additional item worth mentioning, although I'm not yet certain if its a problem
or not. Further along on the quest an 'apparition' will spawn. Apparently there
are at least two types of apparition that spawn. One automatically attacks the
player that spawned it, while the purpose of the other one is not yet
understood. Both are apparently fairly easy to dispatch, and both drop trivial
loot items. The apparition that aggros is apparently meant to be killed, so the
fact that it has an item that is impossible to loot by anyone that can complete
the quest is very strange. The other (non-KOS) apparition apparently has an item
that falls under the trivial loot code as well, although not enough is known
about the quest, yet, to know if it is meant to die in battle with a player that
is unable to loot it.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">At any rate, it is
my personal suspicion that this quest needs to be looked at, and possibly have
the tags on some of the items changed so that they can be looted by those
players who can reasonably be expected to complete the quest.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is one assumption that
you're making here that I want to correct first.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Quests are not always designed to
be completed all at one time. Many quests are designed for the character to grow
into, so that a character might begin a quest at a certain level that he can't
complete until he reaches a higher level. A lot of people see quests as
something to be done all at one time, and that's just not the case.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So it might indeed be true that
some quests in areas that use the Trivial Loot Code can't be completed by folks
that didn't discover the beginnings of the quest in that zone when they were of
a level to do so.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I understand that this may seem
unfair to some of you. I've received a few comments about &quot;punishing people
for leveling&quot; in regards to the Trivial Loot Code. Let me address that
issue while I'm here.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Trivial Loot Code is indeed a
restriction based on the level of the character. But it isn't a punishment, as
if gaining levels was a bad thing. It is simply a way of keeping content
available to those characters of the level that the content was designed for.
It's really no different than the fact that low level characters are restricted
from accessing high level content, or that enchanters are restricted from
accessing certain quests designed for paladins, or that worshippers of a certain
deity are restricted from using items designed for worshippers of another deity.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All of that content is available
to the player. If a player wants to wield a Fiery Defender, he'll need to be
playing a paladin. If a player wants to have a character that can visit the
Plane of Hate, he'll have to level him up. And if a player wants to do a certain
level restricted quest (and, by the way, this isn't the only kind of level
restricted quest in the game…), he'll have to be playing a character of the
appropriate level.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Back to the question, though….
In this case there is indeed a problem with this quest. We'll take a look at it
and see if we can get it fixed for the next patch.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Alan returned to
the thread later to answer some more questions:</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The difference
with a low level character, however, is that they will eventually be able to
increase in levels and obtain the higher level items/complete the higher level
quests. A high level character doesn't have the same option.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I love doing
quests - even if the reward is not an uber item-of-greatness. The Tunare
Initiate quests for example - they came out after the quest mobs were already
green (i.e., trivial), however, the RP potential and general fun of the quests
has prompted me to work on them. If the TLC were in place in that instance, I
would be blocked from the fun of completing the quest.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I'm not suggesting
the TLC be changed - just that you give some consideration to the above
specifically when designing quests.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">And yes, I noticed
that you said the quest at hand would be looked at, just wanted to make the
point for any future quests, etc.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You're correct that a high level
character doesn't have the same option. But what we're really talking about
here, for the most part, is what the player wants not what the character wants.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A player with no high level
characters that wants to experience high level content just needs to gain
experience on one of those characters and he can see that content.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A player with no mid level
characters that wants to experience a level-restricted quest just needs to gain
experience on a low level character and he can see that content.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, there are most certainly
going to be some cases where it is the character's desire to complete a quest
that he can't access due to his greater experience. But that is very different
than a player that claims that they are being unfairly restricted from that
content.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The inclusion of Trivial Loot Code
for Shadows of Luclin does indeed sacrifice the desires of a few high level
characters. In exchange we gain a greater ability for appropriately leveled
characters to access that same content. But in no case is one player given less
of a chance to access any content than any other player.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's not that we are unaware of
the desires of the players. We are very aware of those desires. But there are a
lot of players, with characters of all levels. And all of those players need to
be taken into account as much as possible.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All quests implemented for Shadows
of Luclin will be designed with the Trivial Loot Code in mind.</font>

selection screen soon as well.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">While I understand
this from the perspective as Sony Online and Verant as a business, it does
create a few potential problems. New players to the game are usually recommended
to find a less populated server to start on. Not only is this in the newbie's
best interested, but its in your own interest since the server counts are the
player-driven load-balancing mechanism.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">The other problem
I see is for those players who play outside the United States in different time
zones. Being able to see which servers are populated at the times they are able
to play allows them to find a home which is active during their timezone (not
all servers are).</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">While the decision
is inevitable with the games the competition is offering coming out, will there
be any system for alleviating the problems I mentioned? Even something as simple
as being able to rank the servers in the login screen by population despite the
actual number not being visible?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You will still be able to sort
servers by population, so you will still be able to determine which servers are
the least (or most) populated. This should keep the functionality on par with
the old system, just without the exact numbers.</font>

<p>Sony Online Entertainment and Ubi Soft today announced the postponement of
the European Fan Faire. Our European community of EverQuest players has seen
much growth in the past year and we are excited about all of our initiatives in
this market and beyond. While we regret the delay in bringing what has been an
incredibly successful and one-of-kind event in the U.S., we know that all of our
international initiatives will enhance the player experience, increase our
international fan base and lead us overseas in the coming months.</p>
<p>We want to thank all of the fans who had planned to participate in this
inaugural event and will be sending a full refund in addition to a special gift
from our fan faire team. While we are disappointed that we cannot meet you next
month, we hope that our presence in Europe continues to grow. We will be able to
better serve you by postponing this event to a more suitable time and place for
everyone. We apologize for any inconvenience.</p>
<p>EverQuest boasts more than 410,000 players on a worldwide basis including the
U.S., England, France, Italy, Germany, Canada, Singapore, Zimbabwe, Saudi
Arabia, and New Zealand. We recently announced the availability of Game Cards on
retail shelves worldwide giving cash holders the ability to play in 90-day
increments. And, the initial phase of localization involving both human and
automated translating agents, beginning with French, German, Japanese and Korean
is well underway. Sony Online Entertainment is continuing to build a bridge
between nations and is actively working toward new server deployment plans with
Europe as a primary target.</p>
<p>This winter, all EverQuest players can look forward to the launch of
EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin. The new expansion pack will introduce an
enchanting moonscape packed with new adventure zones, new items, creatures and
spells, a new playable character race and more.</p>

<p>SAN DIEGO, CA - August 29, 2001 - Sony Online Entertainment, a worldwide
leader in multiplayer online gaming announced today that a free zone is being
added to the world of EverQuest®. The addition of the Stonebrunt Mountains will
bring a new set of landmarks, quests, and challenges to EverQuest subscribers at
no additional cost.</p>
<p>Located on the small continent of Odus, the Stonebrunt Mountains are rich
with vegetation and distinctive hills that give way to the towering Mount Klaw;
the largest mountain in Odus and home to the Kerran village of Kejeka. The zone
of Stonebrunt is designed to be a mid-level, outdoor zone similar in scope and
scale to the Lake of Ill Omen on Kunark, which has proven to be a very popular
zone in EverQuest.</p>
<p>&quot;Stonebrunt marks the fifth free zone we've added to the world of
Norrath,&quot; states Brad McQuaid, Vice President of Product Development, Sony
Online Entertainment. &quot;The commitment by our team to give EverQuest
subscribers more uncharted territory to explore is strong and we're very excited
to see new faces on the continent of Odus.&quot;</p>
<p>Other free zones that have been added to EverQuest include: The Temple of
Solusek Ro, Paineel, the Hole, and the Warrens.</p>
<p>Continuing to grow with top-selling expansions The Ruins of KunarkÔ and The
Scars of VeliousÔ, EverQuest proves to be one of the largest fantasy worlds
ever created online. During peak periods, more than 98,000 adventurers and
dragon slayers have explored the world of Norrath simultaneously. The active
global EverQuest subscriber base is comprised of players from various countries
throughout the &quot;real&quot; world, including the U.S., England, Canada,
Japan, Taiwan, Korea, Saudi Arabia, France, Italy and Australia.</p>

several months and I would really like to complete her quest.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, we thought we had her fixed
with the last patch. But she refuses to be fixable.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Basically, despite intense effort
on our part, she won't spawn as she is supposed to. We don't know why. We've
rebuilt her and everything about her. We've examined everything and can't locate
what it is that keeps her from spawning.</font>

we'll get it fixed as soon as we can.</font>
