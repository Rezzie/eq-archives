<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of the clans and the kingdom of
Kelethin</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Little more then three months after their
betrayal of Dagnor and their march to the east, the newly freed orcan slaves
were left stranded with no place to call home. None of the orcs had ever lived
without the watchful eye of an ogre master looking over their shoulder, so now
they were like children: wandering without knowing exactly what they were to do.
The dwarves had made it clear in their pact that, while the kingdom of Kaladim
was responsible for freeing the orcs, they were still very much enemies. It was
not an option for any of the orcs to return west, so they each began plotting
for a new place to live.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The decision was split three ways and the orcs
began to revert back to the methods of their ancestors: splitting into three
differing clans. One clan marched north, taking residence in the familiar
northern peaks of Rakthok's ridge and away from the careful eyes of the dwarves.
The second clan decided to make the grassy fields of the Loping Plains their
home. Even today this clan remains there, looting and plundering any caravans
who happen to pass by. The third, and the largest clan, was lead by a young orc
named Gharol. He convinced the majority of the orcs that true riches lied to the
fertile lands of the east. There, he said, the orcs would find their new home
and the Crushbone clan, as he called his followers, would grow strong.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was at this time, as the Crushbone clan
started making their way further east around the Wayunder lake and straight for
the greater Faydark, that the elven lord of Kelethin began to take notice of
their advancement.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of the border struggles and the
Great Burning</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The elves of Kelethin were tentative at first
and the lord of Kelethin, an old elf by the name of Carandril, sent many
messages to Gharol to ask what his plans were in moving his clan eastward. To
this day no scholar can really be sure if Gharol was able to decipher the
letters or not, as it is general knowledge that most orcs can't read a word of
any written language, but it is certain the orcan lord was angry to find that
another race had already taken residence in the eastern lands. Carandril never
saw any messengers he sent out again, as they were all killed by Gharol
immediately as the letters were exchanged. Acting purely on his instincts, the
leader of the Crushbone clan told his followers of this &quot;new&quot; race and
how they had &quot;stolen&quot; the east from the orcs. Gharol then started to
plot a new plan which would entail the complete destruction of Kelethin and the
enslavement of the elven race, as he thought kelethin was the only city of elves
and the center for the entire elven empire.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Both assumptions were false and the forces of
Gharol were met with bitter, however surprised, resistance on the borders of the
greater faydark. Most of the orcs leading this first attack were killed and the
rest were turned quickly away. Angry at this new defeat and jealous of the elven
strength, Gharol started to plot a new system of attack. He understood that most
of his soldiers had been slaughtered from elves high in the treetops who would
rain showers of arrows down on his forces. So for the second attack, Gharol put
his orcs into a long line of attackers, gave each soldier his own makeshift
torch, and then ordered the entire host to run into the borders of the greater
Faydark and burn whatever they could touch. The Crushbone orcs set fire from
everything to the tops of the trees to the grasses on the forest paths. Nothing
but ash was left in their wake. The elven archers high in the trees were burned
to death and the remaining elven soldiers, horrified and shocked at the tactics
of their strange enemy, began to make a hasty retreat. The wood elves would
later call the incident &quot;The Great Burning.&quot; Gharol, seeing how effective his new methods were, gathered his clan into many small camps
around the greater Faydark and ordered the construction of hundreds of torches
for a second assault. The lord of Kelethin, desperate for help, sent word of his
plight to the heart of the empire: Felwithe.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of the warrior Edril and the Legion
of Wind</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first elf to take interest in Kelethin's
request was a young soldier named Edril. Edril had lived his entire life in
Felwithe, schooled by the best teachers and raised in a wealthy family. Around
his 30th birthday, young by elven standards, he admitted himself into the
imperial school of soldiery where he impressed his teachers with both his
knowledge of military science and his deadly accurate fighting skills. After
graduating and performing many deeds of merit in the imperial army of the elves,
he was chosen as a personal guard of the emperor at the unprecedented age of 50.
What brought him everlasting fame among the elves, however, was not how he
excelled in schooling but what he chose to do for Kelethin. Going straight to
the emperor himself, Edril asked that he be allowed to lead the attack against
the orcs. When the emperor granted his wish, Edril hand picked 100 of the best
elven warriors and the best horses, and rode quickly to the woodland kingdom of
Kelethin.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He was met at Kelethin with a large reception,
but decided to ride through quickly. He was there for only one purpose: to make
a name for himself by destroying the orcs. Little more then two days after
arriving in the city, Edril and his men rode outside the greater Faydark and
headed directly for the first orcan encampment. It was the middle of the night
when Edril made his first strike, and the orcs were completely caught off guard.
Edril's men rode straight over the orcs, slaughtering every clansmen they saw
with little casualties of their own. Edril is said to have fought like a madman,
tallying over 20 kills himself. Without even stopping to catch their breath,
Edril's soldiers rode for the next camp so as to keep the element of surprise.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One by one the camps of the crushbone orcs were
destroyed quickly and brutally. The orcs, still preparing for their second
assault on Kelethin, were always caught by surprise. Edril and his men moved
from one battle to the next so quickly, the elves called them the legion of
wind. The strategy worked perfectly: Gharol was never able to get word of the
new attackers in time to plan a defense and so most of the orcs were
slaughtered. The final battle, lasting longer then the rest, was against
Gharol's own camp. Many of Edril's warriors were killed in this fight but all of
the orcs, including Gharol, were driven away to the deep growth of the wild
Greater Faydark. Here they have made their makeshift kingdom. When Edril
returned to his kingdom, he was proclaimed high protector of Kelethin with over
150 kills to his name alone. This would not be the last time Edril's name was
written into elven history, however. It is believed that only weeks later after
their retreat, Gharol was killed by his own followers.</font></p>
