<P><A name=2></A><B>Innate Strength</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Statistical<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases base STR by 2 per level.<BR>
Only useful for magicians if encumberance is an issue. 
Usually it's better to just buy weight reducing bags. </P>

<P><A name=3></A><B>Innate Stamina</b><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Statistical<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases base STA by 2 per level.<BR>
Marginally useful for magicians. At level 65 with 5 points in this skill, this increase only amounts to a maximum 26 hit points without Natural Durability.</P>

<P><A name=4></A><B>Innate Agility</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Statistical<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases base AGI by 2 per level.<BR>
Minor usefulness to magicians, due to already low midigation abilities. </P>

<P><A name=5></A><B>Innate Dexterity</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Statistical<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases base DEX by 2 per level.<BR>
Slightly helpful to magicians. DEX is used in conjunction with channeling skill, and every bit of DEX helps increase 
channeling success.</P>

<P><A name=6></A><B>Innate Intelligence</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Statistical<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases base INT by 2 per level.<BR>
Useful for magicians with little to no access to INT gear, but useless if already at cap. With level 65 and more than 200 INT with 5 points in this skill, this amounts to 65 more mana. With less than 200 INT, this amounts to 130 mana.</P>

<P><A name=7></A><B>Innate Wisdom</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Statistical<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases base WIS by 2 per level.<BR>
Useless for magicians, as wisdom has no relevance to magicians.</P>

<P><A name=8></A><b>Innate Charisma</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Statistical<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases base CHA by 2 per level.<BR>
Useful for extra saves with Call of the Arch Mage and Elemental Silence. Also helps to decrease vendor prices. However, it's usually better to buy Charisma gear than purchase this ability.</P>

<P><A name=9></A><B>Innate Fire Protection</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Statistical<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases base Fire Resistance by 2 per level.<BR>
Useful to help save versus fire based spells.</P>

<P><A name=10></A><B>Innate Cold Protection</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Statistical<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases base Cold Resistance by 2 per level.<BR>
Useful to help save versus cold based spells.</P>

<P><A name=11></A><B>Innate Magic Protection</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Statistical<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases base Magic Resistance by 2 per level.<BR>
Useful to help save versus magic based spells.</P>

<P><A name=12></A><B>Innate Poison Protection</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Statistical<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases base Poison Resistance by 2 per level.<BR>
Useful to help save versus poison based spells. This is particularly useful, since there are few magician usable items with saves versus Poison.</P>

<P><A name=13></A><B>Innate Disease Protection</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Statistical<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases base Disease Resistance by 2 per level.<BR>
Useful to help save versus disease based spells. This is particularly useful, since there are few magician usable items with saves versus Disease.</P>

<P><A name=14></A><B>Innate Run Speed</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Defense/Support<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases innate run speed by 10% per level.<BR>
Highly useful for all classes, especially solo magicians. This run speed does not stack with run speed spells such as Spirit of Wolf; rather run speed spells overwrite this ability. Marginally useful outdoors because of that, but highly useful indoors unless Spirit of the Shrew is available.</P>

<P><A name=15></A><B>Innate Metabolism</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Decreases food consumption by 10, 25, and 50%.<BR>
While mages can already summon food and drink in unlimited quantities, sometimes player-made Stat food (such as Misty Thicket Picnics) will be desired. This also significantly decreases food consumption of horses and drogmors (which inherently increases food consumption dramatically).</P>

<P><A name=16></A><B>Innate Lung Capacity</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases air capacity by 10%, 25%, and 50%.<BR>
Almost useless for magicians, since magicians have the ability to summon Waterstones which grant Enduring Breath to the user.</P>

<P><A name=17></A><B>First Aid</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases the Bind Wound cap by 10% per level.<BR>
Quite useful for solo magicians, since you can now bandage while meditating. At level 3, this allows the magician to bandage to 100%.</P>

<P><A name=18></A><B>New Tanaan Crafting Mastery</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 51<BR>
3 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 3 / 3<BR>
Allows more than one tradeskill to exceed 200.<BR>
While useless for most, for the tradeskill fanatics this is a dream come true. This allows players to reach 250 skill in all 7 major tradeskills: Baking, Brewing, Fletching, Jewelcraft, Pottery, Smithing, and Tailoring.</P>

<P><A name=19></A><B>Innate Regeneration</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Statistical<BR>
Level 51<BR>
1 / 1 / 1<BR>
Increases innate HP regeneration by 1 point per level.<BR>
This is most ideal for soloing where magicians do not have access to healing spells, but has utility elsewhere as well. With Level 65 and 3 points in this ability, a magician will completely negate the effects of a Rod of Mystical Transevergence while buffless, sitting and standing.</P>

<P><A name=21></A><B>Spell Casting Mastery</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<BR>
2 / 4 / 6<BR>
Increases innate mana preservation by 2.5%, 5%, and 10%<BR>
This ability is the most powerful ability magicians have access to. At level 3, 10% mana is saved on all spells. This stacks with all innate specialization and all mana preservation effects. (note: the in-game description is wrong. Its been tested repeatedly, and this explanation is correct.</P>

<P><A name=22></A><B>Spell Casting Fury</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Offense<BR>
Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<BR>
2 / 4 / 6<BR>
Increases chance to perform critical nukes to 2%, 4%, and 7%.<BR>
With level 1, spells have a 2% chance to perform a 33% critical blast. At level 2, spells have a 4% chance to perform 66% critical blasts. At level 3, spells will do double damage 7% of the time. Over time this ability will provide a significant increase in magician DPS.</P>

<P><A name=23></A><B>Channeling Focus</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Defense/Support<BR>
Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<BR>
2 / 4 / 6<BR>
Increases channeling abilities by 5%, 10%, and 15%.<BR>
This increases the chance for a magician to take hits and continue to channel spells on the attacker. This is most useful for the solo magician and very marginal use in groups or raids.</P>

<P><A name=24></A><B>Spell Casting Subtlety</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Offense/Defense<BR>
Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<BR>
2 / 4 / 6<BR>
Decreases spell aggro by 5%, 10%, and 20%.<BR>
Highly useful for all magicians. Decreases aggro generated by 20% at level 3, which allows a magician to "chainnuke" longer than he normally could before gaining undesired aggro.</P>

<P><A name=25></A><B>Spell Casting Expertise</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<BR>
2 / 4 / 6<BR>
Removes the chance to fizzle on spells below level 20, 35, and 52.<BR>
Only minor use for magicians, since most high level magicians rarely cast low level spells. However, level 1 removes the chance to fizzle Gate (it does not remove the chance for Gate to collapse)</P>

<P><A name=26></A><B>Spell Casting Deftness</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<BR>
2 / 4 / 6<BR>
Reduces cast time on beneficial buff spells with cast times greater than 4 seconds by 5%, 15%, and 25%.<BR>
Marginally useful for magicians, since magicians have very few buff spells.</P>

<P><A name=27></A><B>Natural Durability</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Defense/Statistical<BR>
Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<BR>
2 / 4 / 6<BR>
Increases HP from STA and items by 2%, 5%, and 10%.<BR>
This increases the HP granted from a magicians STA and from +HP on items. At level 3 a 10STA 100HP item will actually be seen as a 11STA 110HP item. No matter how you look at it, more HP is very important, and its something you can never have enough of.</P>

<P><A name=28></A><B>Combat Stability</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Defense<BR>
Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<BR>
2 / 4 / 6<BR>
Increase melee midigation by 2%, 5%, and 10%.<BR>
Most useful for the solo magician since one should rarely get hit on raids and groups.</P>

<P><A name=29></A><B>Combat Agility</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Defense<BR>
Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<BR>
2 / 4 / 6<BR>
Increases melee avoidance by 2%, 5%, and 10%.<BR>
Highly useful for all mages. Less hits means less heals, and less hits means a greater chance of survival.</P>

<P><A name=30></A><B>Mental Clarity</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 55 - 6 points in General Abilities<BR>
2 / 4 / 6<BR>
Increases base mana regeneration by 1 point per level.<BR>
This increases base mana regeneration, and stacks with all forms of mana regeneration. Mental Clarity 1 is relatively cheap. However Mental Clarity 2 and 3 are considered expensive.</P>

<P><A name=32></A><B>Mass Group Buff</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<BR>
9<BR>
Reuse Time: 72 minutes<BR>
Allows for group buffs to be cast on all players within range of the spell. Also doubles the mana cost of the spell.<BR>
Almost useless for magicians, since the only three spells that can be used are group damage shields. However on some fights this can mean the difference between success and failure.</P>

<P><BR><A name=33></A><B>Mend Companion</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Pet Defense<BR>
Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<BR>
5<BR>
Reuse Time: 36 minutes<BR>
Allows Magicians to perform a Lay-On-Hands type ability for their pets.<BR>
At level 65, this ability does 2146 hp worth of healing. Highly useful for soloing. Reuse time can be further decreased by the PoP ability Hasted Mend.</P>

<P><A name=34></A><B>Frenzied Burnout</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Pet Offense<BR>
Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<BR>
6<BR>
Reuse Time: 72 minutes<BR>
Duration: 36 seconds<BR>
Increases pet haste by 15%, and allows the pet to perform flurries and rampages.<BR>
Almost useless for magicians, but can provide a short increase in pet damage, and could mean the difference between victory and defeat. Frenzied Burnout's haste is similar to Bard Overhaste, and stacks with all forms of haste. It also allows the pet to exceed the haste cap.</P>

<P><A name=35></A><B>Elemental Form: Fire</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>SUpport<BR>
Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<BR>
3 / 6 / 9<BR>
Cast Time: 8 seconds<BR>
Duration: 36 minutes<BR>
Reuse Time: 15 minutes<BR>
Turns the magician into a fire elemental, granting 10, 20, and 30 points of damage shield, as well as 10, 20, and 30 INT.<BR>
Marginal use outdoors, since one cannot ride horses and be an elemental at the same time. Most useful for indoors. This is the most useless elemental form.</P>

<P><A name=36></A><B>Elemental Form: Water</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<BR>
3 / 6 / 9<BR>
Cast Time: 8 seconds<BR>
Duration: 36 minutes<BR>
Reuse Time: 15 minutes<BR>
Turns the magician into a water elemental, granting enduring breath and increasing mana regeneration by 1, 2, and 4 points per level.<BR>
Marginal use outdoors, since one cannot ride horses and be an elemental at the same time. Most useful for indoors and underwater.</P>

<P><A name=37></A><B>Elemental Form: Earth</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<BR>
3 / 6 / 9<BR>
Cast Time: 8 seconds<BR>
Duration: 36 minutes<BR>
Reuse Time: 15 minutes<BR>
Turns the magician into an earth elemental, granting 5, 10, and 20 STA as well as 50, 100, and 200 HP.<BR>
Marginal use outdoors, since one cannot ride horses and be an elemental at the same time. Most useful indoors.</P>

<P><A name=38></A><B>Elemental Form: Air</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<BR>
3 / 6 / 9<BR>
Cast Time: 8 seconds<BR>
Duration: 36 minutes<BR>
Reuse Time: 15 minutes<BR>
Turns the magician into an air elemental, granting levitation and increasing all resists by 10, 20, and 40.<BR>
Marginal use outdoors, since one cannot ride horses and be an elemental at the same time. Useless in zones where levitation does not work. Quite useful for area effect battles, where resists are the key to survival.</P>

<P><A name=39></A><B>Improved Reclaim Energy</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<BR>
3<BR>Alters the formula to Reclaim Energy<BR>
Changes the formula to Reclaim Energy to return 95% of the mana used to summon the pet. This considers all forms of mana preservation present on the mage at the time the pet is summoned. Normal Reclaim Energy is only 75%. This is most useful to mages that employ chain-summoning techniques for killing monsters.</P>

<P><A name=40></A><B>Turn Summoned</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Offense<BR>
Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<BR>
5<BR>
Reuse Time: 72 minutes<BR>
Allows magicians to cast an area effect Fear + DoT on summoned creatures, centered around the magician.<BR>
Almost useless, since very few areas have large quantities of summoned creatures. Furthermore, the spell is resistable, and can have high resists. Even worse is that all level 55+ mobs are immune to fear, and therefore cannot be affected by this ability.</P>

<P><A name=41></A><B>Elemental Pact</B><BR>
<B>Category: </B>Support<BR>
Level 59 - 12 points in Archetype Abilities<BR>

Eliminates the consumption of malachite when summoning pets.<BR>
Removes the malachite cost of summoning pets, but does not remove the need to carry malachite; at least one must be carried at all times. Worth noting that Servant of Marr, Child of Ro, and Rathe's Son do not consume malachite, reducing the value of this AA; however Ward of Xegony and Monster Summoning IV do consume malachite.</P>

Allows a magician to execute a /pet hold command, forcing the pet to stop attacking until told to attack.<BR>
By far one of the magicians most powerful abilities, this removes most liability with using a pet by allowing the mage to control when to attack. Highly useful for the raid mage, and very useful for both the solo and the group mage.</P>

Once this ability is activated, pets will /shield their master from incoming damage, effectively cutting incoming damage to the mage in half with the pet taking 50% to 75% of the damage intended for the magician.
