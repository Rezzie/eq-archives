<P>So you want to learn how to chain cast pets, and find out just what all the hoopla is all about? Here's a how-to. 

<P>1. For starters, pick a pet appropriate for chain casting. The overriding bias is to use an earth pet. The pet root will help keep the mob away from you between killing the old pet and siccing the new pet. You can theoretically use any pet, however. Don't be afraid to experiment. 

<P>2. Keep in mind that the biggest key to chain casting is mana recovery. Buffing the pet should be kept to a minimum to conserve mana. If you find that you can recover your mana quickly enough, buffing the pet can be used to accelerate the kill. 

<P>3. Make sure you have these hotkeys set up: <BR>
a. /pet attack b. /Assist , and optionally c. /pet report health 

<P>4. This part kind of goes without saying, but bring a lot of malachite with you to keep you hunting for a while between merchant trips. It's inexpensive, and a wise investment. 

<P>5. Find a safe spot to pull to, and park your pet there (/pet guard here). Now pull your mob. The preference is to use a low aggro spell like a small nuke, or cancel magic, or Malaise-type spell. <BR>
Alternately, you could use your pet to pull to you, by using /pet attack, then once the mob is aggroed either spam /pet back off or if you have the AA "Pet Discipline" simply use /pet hold. 

<P>6. Sic your pet now, and quickly start negotiating a safe sitting distance. <BR>*Sit down and meditate while the pet is fighting*, and hit f1 twice to target your pet and monitor pet hit points. Pet hit points are your major concern early in the fight, and monitoring them is critical. 

<P>7. Depending on how fast the pet is losing hit points, you will want to recast roughly when the pet is between 20 and 40% of his hit points. When it's time to recast, hit your /Assist hotkey to target the mob, then start casting a new pet. 

<P>8. It takes 10 seconds to cast a new pet, so you have approximately 9 seconds to type this message: /pet get lost. Do not make this a hotkey, and when you type it do NOT hit <Enter> yet. Wait until you have half a bubble of casting time left, then hit <Enter> to kill the old pet. Your new pet will appear in about half a second or so. At that time, hit your /pet attack hotkey to continue the fight. Go back to step 6 and repeat until the mob is either low on hit points or dead. <BR>
Alternately, with the New UI, you can click the "Go Away" button in the pet window instead of typing /pet get lost. 

<P>9. When the mob is low on hit points you must decide whether you want full experience for the kill, or share it with your pet. If you pulled with a small nuke and did any damage, you will get full experience for the kill. If not you will need to nuke at least once before the mob dies to get full experience. If the pet does all the damage it will take 75% of the experience. 

<P>10. Dead mob, loot at will.
