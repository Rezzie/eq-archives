Patch Addendum<br>
<br>
Shralok Pack and Pending Lore<br>
<br>
It's apparent that some EQ players, primarily those who started playing after the introduction of the LORE tag, did not know what the "Pending Lore" tag meant.  "Pending Lore" means that in the future, an item WILL become LORE, making it so the character can possess only one.  When this change occurs, the server deletes additional items upon login.<br>
<br>
The Shralok Pack is one of those items.  However, due to the number of people unaware of the meaning of the tag, we've changing it back to "Pending Lore".  Players who had the item disappear from their characters can contact a GM to have their characters restored to the time of the last backup.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Going forward, we will work to distribute additional notification when making a change of this type.  To that end, the Shralok Pack will become a LORE item in the very near future, and players should take steps to remove all items and get rid of additional packs.  It should be noted that there is no guarantee as to which pack(s) will be deleted when the server reduces the total number owned to one, so you will want to destroy any superfluous packs manually.<br>
<br>
Healing and Hate<br>
<br>
A team member has asked that we clarify the changes to the way hate is awarded in healing.  The important point that may not have been clear below is that there is a cap on the amount of hate that can be awarded for any particular heal spell.  For a target below level 51, no heal spell can generate more than 800 hate, regardless of the number of hitpoints healed.  For targets level 51 or above, the cap is higher, but does not approach the total hitpoints of a fully buffed warrior.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Casting Difficulty<br>
<br>
The patch message mentioned that the casting difficulty for spells above level 56 was reduced.  The actual value is spells of level 51 or above.  These spells should fizzle less than they did before.<br>
<br>
Crashing on Zoning<br>
<br>
We tracked down and eliminated another bug that was causing some people to intermittently crash upon zoning.  If you were affected by this problem you should notice better performance.<br>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Typo, sorry. It’s fixed.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Let Bard
Songs/group spells affect our pets...</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nope. There is a reason that these
spells don’t affect pets. It would restrict the power of those spells if they
had to be balanced to deal with pets. Pets are balanced internally with each
class that gets them.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">/pet report buffs&nbsp;</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I don’t think I heard this one
before. I’ll add it, but it sounds like a lot more work that it might be
worth...</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">/pet no attack</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Talk to your fellow magicians. For
every one that asks for this, I hear from another one that says that they have
enough control already, and that this can be done by a vigilant magician without
such a command. I’ll add it to the list. But I think it’s a bad idea.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">This would cause
your pet to not add any mobs to your hate list unless you did /pet attack. /pet
attack would cause your pet to attack the mob you told it to, but if something
else hit it, or hit you, the pet would not aggro on it. This would make our pets
1000% more desired on raids, where there would be no chance of them breaking mez
on dangerous high-level mobs.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, it sure would. And it would
also make them totally and completely reliable. There would be no danger to
using them, and no skill either. Remember, the only real limitation to your pets
is that they are not as smart as characters played by people. There is no way
that I’ll suggest this in this format.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I will suggest a /pet noattack,
that will have the pet just sit there and not respond to any attacks. But
letting the magician completely control the pets hate list isn’t even close to
reasonable.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The most important
thing I want that isn't on that list is a means of escape in outdoor zones, such
as an item with charges of blind or 1 charge of root or anything.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dude, that is the drawback of the
class. Besides, your pets work pretty well as a method of escape.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I think this
entire tuning thing is just opening a big ugly can of worms and no matter what
is done somebody is going to get pissed off.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That may very well be true. It’s
really unfortunate that even trying to talk about the game seems to garner so
much anger. But if people are going to be angry, it’s not going to be because
we didn’t try.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Absor's list even
has the same mistake sin it as previous (i.e. post 50 pets being worse than 29th
level, it's meant to be worse than 49th level isn't it?).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, that 29 was the number you
folks gave me. I’ll make it 49th.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">And what about the
summoning suggestions, the addition of other types of DD spells (cold based),
and not to mention the many problem zones not listed in the pathing point
(Najena, HH Keep, etc).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">New types of DD are not in the
cards. Remember, it’s the whole benefit for being a wizard that they get all
the lines of damage spells. And I didn’t see anyone mention Nejena or High
Hold. Sure, I probably missed writing down some things. But I certainly read
everything. I know, I was there.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">While I applaud
the idea of discussion threads it makes it appear to be a token gesture if the
issues raised in them aren't addressed (even if only to be dismissed).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No token gesture at all. But I
suppose I didn’t take enough time to explain why some ideas weren’t going on
the list.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Oh yeah, CoTH, let
it work through zones, or move it down to 50 and make CotH II.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another one of those that I
didn’t list because I know the answer. It’s no.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is a reason that Call of the
Hero doesn’t summon people across zone lines already. As the spell exists
right now it allows people to bypass content that they were never intended to
bypass, making some encounters far easier than intended.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Nothing on the Pet
Experience issue?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, no. I guess I’ll add it,
but I certainly wouldn’t expect it to change.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Shard of the core
is equipable already in the range slot. What you meant to say was to make it
equipable in the AMMO slot like the cold and heatstone (which by the way will
still make it useless until you drop the no drop tag on it)</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ok, changed. But I suspect it’s
no drop for a reason.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Description: This
is a wonderful spell, and currently is not usable in the plane of sky. Please
turn on CotH in sky.&nbsp;</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You’re kidding, right? It’s
turned off there because of the way the zone works.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Let our pets melee
and cast with no delay, as hybrids are.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There’s an idea I hadn’t heard
before. I’m not sure that it will pass, but I’ll add it.</font>

Patch Day<br>
<br>
Today's patch contains a wide variety of enhancements and changes.  Due to the number of changes being made, this list is primarily a summary.  Extended descriptions of the changes and the reasoning behind them can be solicited on the EverQuest Message Boards.<br>
<br>
Spell and Skill Changes<br>
<br>
Druids, Shaman, and Clerics</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Superior Healing moved to level 51 for shamans and druids.&nbsp;<br>
 Casting difficulty of Superior Heal reduced (less fizzles)<br>
 New level 55 Druid and shaman spell, Chloroblast, similar to remedy for clerics.<br>
 New Druid spell at level 60, upgrade to superior healing, Natures Touch.<br>
 Created a new spell effect for Celestial Healing, Celestial Elixir, and Torpor.  This will allow them to stack with all other spells, save spells of the same type (Heal over time).  Prior to this, all heal-over-time spells followed the same rules as regeneration spells.<br>
 Reduced the casting difficulty of Remedy.<br>
 Lowered recast time on Wake of Karana<br>
<br>
Paladins</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Added Endure Magic spell at level 30<br>
 Added Resist Magic at 55<br>
 Moved Guard spell from 49 to 39<br>
 Moved Armor of Faith from 53 to 49<br>
 Added New level 53 paladin spell: Divine Glory<br>
 Added New level 59 spell: Celestial Cleansing&nbsp;<br>
 Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors<br>
 Added Yaulp 4 at 60 and enhanced.<br>
<br>
Shadowknights</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Removed artificially inflated mana cost for pre level 50 lifetap spells.  Please note that post-50 lifetap spells never had an inflated mana cost.<br>
 Moved Spirit Tap to level 55<br>
 Moved Drain Spirit to level 57<br>
 Added Drain Soul at level 60<br>
 Grim Aura added at level 22 and enhanced<br>
 Moved Shieldskin to level 34<br>
 Pet buff added at 29<br>
 Added Diamondskin spell at 59<br>
 Defense skill cap made exactly same as warriors<br>
 Due to the recent improvements to "Harmtouch", it is doing much more damage than it would before and unbalances PvP.  As such it will now do less damage in PvP (68% of PvE, down from 80%).  In addition, Shadowknights on the PvP servers were routinely killing themselves via non-XP losing means and attacking other players with Harmtouch immediately upon respawn.  In order to address this situation, Harmtouch is no longer automatically "recharged" by death on the PvP Servers.<br>
 The "Lifeleech" discipline now increases hit probability in addition to its other effects.<br>
<br>
Rangers</font></p>

 Added See Invisible at 39<br>
<br>

 Bards defensive skill made exactly the same as a warriors<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Lowered recast time on Visions of Grandeur<br>
<br>
Bug Fixes<br>
<br>
 Aggressive and Defensive disciplines have been fixed.  Before they would only affect damage taken and not affect damage dealt out.  Now they affect both as designed.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Fixed the bug with going to the spellbook when the inventory window was up in fullview mode. It should work now. Also, fixed a minor bug where if you were in normal mode and tried to go to the spellbook from inventory via /book or the keymapped key it would not go, and it would make the done button not work properly for the inventory mode.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Fixed NPC melee ranges to be the same as for player characters.  In other words, if you can hit the NPC, he can hit you.  This bug was a problem with one dragon that could be hit, but could not hit back.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Fixed a bug that made it impossible to "Call of the Hero" someone out of water or lava.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Fixed the proc on the Chilled Scythe.  Owners of this item will need to swap it out with a
GM.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 The Kromzek Surveyor Scope now fits in the "Ranged" slot rather than the "Ammo" slot as before.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Fixed a bug that caused the two single-target bard snare songs to break too soon in some cases.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Fixed a bug whereby NPCs would consider the race of a player prior to the loading of the faction table upon zoning or logging in.  This would cause people to be attacked by things that normally like them.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Players should now be properly removed from the group regardless of how they exit the game.<br>
<br>
Misc Changes<br>
<br>
 Added text labels to the fullview inventory window "body" slots (Available only to Velious Subscribers)</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Added the ability to toggle those labels on and off. Use /invwinlabels [on/off] (or no arguments to toggle). This is saved in the eqclient.ini file in the [Defaults] section with the key
InvWinLabels=[TRUE/FALSE]</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Increased the pre-50 bind-wounds cap for rogues and warriors.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Pickpocket now works to a max of 5 levels below you, or level 45...whichever is greater... You can pickpocket NPC up to level 55 if you are level 60.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 The mouse pointer will now move at a multiple of its normal speed when you adjust the MousePointerSpeedMod setting in the eqclient.ini file.  You can set that multiple on-the-fly with the /mousespeed command.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 The "AutoHelp" feature that can be set under the options menu has been enhanced.  Spell casters in particular might want to turn it on and try depressing the ALT key.  It's perfect for refreshing your memory in regards to your spell lineup.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 If you are interrupted while trying to cast a spell that uses a component, you will no longer use that component.  Jewelers should be very pleased with this change.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Reduced the casting difficulty (fizzle rate) of all spells over level 56.  Spells have always previously been set up so that it's usually more efficient to use a spell from a previous circle than the current one.  The formula did not take into account the fact that everyone stops at 60.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Changed it so that players will now lose experience when they die in the Arena in Kael Drakkel.  It seems that people were fighting giants in that arena in order to avoid the death penalty.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Naked PC corpses that have experience and are above level 30 will now last 3 hours instead of 3 minutes.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Avatar and Focus of Spirit should now stack.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Raised the pre and post 50 bind wounds cap for paladins, clerics, druids, and shaman.<br>
<br>
Item Changes<br>
<br>
 The effect on the "Frost Giant Beard" can now be used at 35th level rather than level
50.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 The Wurmslayer will now fit in a bag.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Iksar can now use the Ashenbone Shield.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Chandged Crystallized Shadow leggings to rentable.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Changed Gorilla Hide Leggings to show up as leather, was cloth before.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Changed Envy from a piercing weapon to a shield so players could Bash with it. Envy is a parrying dagger.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 The Shralok Pack is now LORE.  It was set to pending-lore some time ago.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 The Guardian and Sentry Armor bracers are no longer LORE.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
 Donal's Breastplate can now only be used on any individual target once every 7.5 minutes.  This addresses some of the balance issues that became apparent given the existence of a mana-free complete heal.<br>
<br>

<br>
 Fixed the Gator Roll baking recipe.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>

 Repaired the recipe for converting 3 Enchanted Large Adamantite Bricks into 1 Enchanted Block of Adamantite in the Tier`Dal Forge, it was previously only possible in the Oggok Forge.</font></p>

 Mithril Studs will be stackable.<br>
<br>
NPC AI - Hate<br>
<br>
We've made a number of changes to NPC AI, specifically to the section dealing with target-selection, or what's commonly referred to as "Hate". It is not so much that NPCs react differently to hate now than before, but that we've changed the way that hate is awarded.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
 We reduced the amount of hate that can be caused by a proc.  Due to the high proc rates at upper levels, the amount of hate generated from procs, and the spells that were selected for those procs, made keeping the attention of the creature much too easy a task for the tank.  Simply, it nearly eliminated the challenge of keeping a foes attention at levels above 50.<br>
<br>
 We've capped the amount of hate that can be awarded to most casters, specifically for debuff-type spells like the Malo and Tash series.  The hate calculation for these spells takes into account the number of hitpoints of the NPC and did not "play nice" with the increased HP limit of Velious.  It explains why Enchanters, for instance, would complain that casting a Tash spell would lead to near-instant death.<br>
<br>
 We've redressed the amount of hate generated by heal spells.  Previously, and *partly* due to a bug, the high level heal spells such as superior heal or complete heal would generate no more hate than greater heal.  In fact, so little hate was generated by these spells that it made controlling NPC aggression trivial.  Heal spells will now generate an amount of hate more in line with the number of hitpoints actually healed.  Due to our desire to leave the lower level game more or less untouched, two separate caps have been placed for targets level 50 or below, and 51 or above.  Heal spells will generate significantly less hate for targets below level 51 than those at or above that level.<br>
<br>
 We've also re-evaluated ways that players have to reduce their own hate.  While spells in place to allow this are OK, the Evade skill (possessed by rogues) let them out of their damage too easily.  A rogue that successfully evaded would immediately drop to a level of hate lower than someone who was in the awareness range, but hadn't done anything to really upset the creature such as damage it or heal its foe.  This problem was exacerbated by the increase of the size of the hate list implemented with Velious.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Tracking<br>
<br>
Tracking now works in full view for all classes that can use it, and sports a nifty scroll bar that allows players to see everything on the list.  In addition, the /trackplayer setting is now saved to the eqclient.ini file.<br>
<br>
The following options have been put in for Rangers only:<br>
<br>
/tracksort &lt;normal/distance/consider/rconsider/rdistance>&nbsp;<br>
/trackfilter &lt;red/yellow/white/blue/green><br>
<br>
*/tracksort options beginning with R are reverse order<br>
<br>
Hybrid Casting<br>
<br>
Hybrids that cast spells in combat were taking double penalties at higher levels.  The casting times of their spells went up, and the amount of melee damage they do per second went up.  This results is having to take longer to cast spells, and losing more damage/second for each second taken in casting.  To help offset this, Rangers, Paladins and Shadowknights casting non-beneficial spells that have casting times greater than or equal to 3 seconds, now get a 3 % reduction in casting time for each level over 50.  3% at 51, 6% at 52, etc., to 30% at 60.  Again, this applies only to non-beneficial spells.&nbsp;<br>

these lists:<br>
<br>
First and foremost, understand that this is only a list of concerns to be
brought to the Live Team. This is not a list of promises, and I'm certainly not
telling you that any or all of these items will be changed or implemented.<br>
<br>
Also, there are three types of items that I don't have listed here. Epic Quests,
Magic Resistances in Velious and Mid-level quests. Those three items were
mentioned by enough classes that I've pulled them out for separate examination.<br>
<br>
All items are currently marked with NONE for status. Obviously we've already
started working on some items, you've seen the lists from the patch messages on
the Test Server. I will be updating the status for items early next week to
reflect those potential changes and with any responses from the team. I just
wanted to get these lists out to you fresh.<br>
<br>
I want these lists to be final as you see them now, but I know there will need
to be changes made. So this list is not final. But if you want something added
to or removed from the list, please be convincing about the change. At this
point I don't want to tack on too many more items, since the team is already
reviewing the original list.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the input so far.<br>
<br>
