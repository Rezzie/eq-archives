an alignment :</font>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With
this server we have decided to introduce the idea of alignment into the world of
Norrath. This is an idea used in many roleplaying games to help the players and
the game master to further describe their characters, to express their social
and emotional personality in much the same way that we take the time to describe
a character's physical appearance.</font>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because
this concept is new to EverQuest, we have written descriptions of each of the
nine possible alignments. Each description is an outline of the ideals of these
alignment types; characters can, of course, move around within the border of
those ideals as they see fit. We encourage you to choose an alignment that suits
the personality of your character. A character that is in all ways neutral, but
refuses to aid a dark elf or troll because he believes them to be evil, might be
neutral good, not neutral.</font>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">These
are things that often develop as you play your character. When you started out
with a new character you may have had certain designs in mind for her. You might
have seen her as tolerant of both good and evil, willing to help anyone that
needed it. But as she travels and meets people she might realize that helping
evil people has never been a pleasant experience, and that indeed she feels
obliged to obey the rules and learns to despise rogues. A character that you
thought would be neutral when you created her may end up being neutral good
after the two of you experience Norrath a bit.</font>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This
is why you will not be able to choose the alignment of your character until you
reach 10th level. Instead, your character will be given an alignment when you
choose his class, race and deity. That alignment will match the ideals of that
character's teachers. If your character starts as an agnostic human warrior, he
will have left his training with all the impressions that his teachers gave him
about the world. Because the character spent so long under the tutelage of
people who insisted that a warrior must follow the middle road and be willing to
fight when and where he was needed, he will enter his career as a neutral. But
adventuring changes people, and after ten levels of such adventure you will be
able to decide your character's alignment, within restrictions determined by
that character's race, class and deity. For example, high elves must be good,
and will be restricted to good alignment options when they reach tenth level, or
at any time thereafter.</font>

  <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A
  person of neutral alignment can be very different from another person of the
  same alignment. For example, a druid might actively defend the center, holding
  a strong desire that neither good nor evil, order nor discord gain control in
  the world, for each of them is inherently unbalanced and unnatural. But a
  warrior of neutral alignment might be unconcerned about such things and simply
  wish that all those with such strong opinions keep them to themselves. In
  either case, the neutral character is not strongly allied with the ideas of
  order or discord, good or evil.</font></p>

  is a character of unruly nature; whether in opposition to the tenets of order
  or just because they prefer to be unconstrained, is immaterial. These folk
  tend to be unmindful of the rules of society, preferring to do what seems
  correct to them at the moment. This isn't a destructive kind of chaos such as
  would make a person evil, nor is it a gentle chiding of the rules intended to
  show where constraints hinder the ability for one to do what is good. Folks of
  this alignment are most often just unable to understand why others have the
  right to blanket their lives with rules when those rules can't be accurate for
  any of the specific situations that they find themselves in.</font>

  of this alignment believe foremost that sentient races must have rules to
  abide by, or they will become lost in uncivilized discord. This does not
  necessarily make them proselytizers of order. It is just as likely that one of
  this alignment would only hold themselves to such restrictions. But even so,
  their belief in the ordering of things is strong and they will often find it
  challenging to allow discord to work around them. One of this alignment will
  follow the rules of any society he finds himself in, and will tend to avoid
  the company of those that hold no rules or laws important.</font>

  rules. If rules cause others to be troubled, then they should be able to go
  where such rules do not apply. But neither rules nor a hatred of such rules
  should be an excuse for a person to be evil. Above all else, being good is
  what matters. This may only be a personal goal, or it might be something that
  the character desires for others. In any case, such a person will be unable to
  abide evil in any form. How they respond to such evil will vary from person to
  person, but they will never encourage evil and will never aid one that does
  evil.</font>

  goals might be personal, or they may wish to impress evil upon others. But
  evil is in them, and they can not tolerate goodness. They will never aid a

  hinder them or shun them.</font>

  of this alignment form the heart of many evil societies. Their rules may be
  cruel, perhaps even frightening, but they are the devices that keep society in
  line. Evil to the core, these characters understand the power of organization
  and order, and they know that the way of discord is the way of
  self-destruction. If you want your dreams to come true, either as a person or
  as a society, then you must have the strength of order to build on. Structure
  is what makes evil terrible and mighty. Ambitious orderly evils desire the
  destruction of all that is good, and often have a plan for making that happen.</font>

  find those of order to be far too constrained by their own rules to be
  effective. Only those willing to throw off the shackles of order can ever
  truly be great. Seething chaos is the soil that nourishes true evil. Honor is

  of this alignment believe that good is enhanced by order. True peace can only
  be achieved through the foundation of just rules and true goodness. Discord
  breeds evil, for those who are unwilling to follow rules most often do so
  because those rules enforce what is good. Certainly some rules are unjust and
  should be defied. But such rules are only created by those who are evil at
  heart. Societies, families, and individuals alike should be willing to do what
  is right, and to set what is right down as law. Some might be asked to make
  sacrifices for the good of others. Those unwilling to do so, those who say
  that rules are too constraining and are unwilling to abide by them because it
  discomforts them to do so, are selfish. Selfishness often leads to evil. Evil
  is intolerable.</font>

  <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Characters
  of this alignment believe that being good is an internal measure, not a
  societal one. Many of the rules that societies create have nothing to do with
  being good, but are designed to restrict people so that they can't be evil. A
  fine distinction, to be sure. But how can a rule, written onto a piece of
  paper or carved into stone by someone days, months or even years prior have
  any pertinence to an action taking place right now? Stealing is against the
  rules in many places, but it is not by its very nature evil. It is only the
  intent of the person doing the stealing that determines the goodness of the
  act. Stealing money from an evil man and using that money to feed those who
  have little is a good act, not an evil one. Rules hinder many acts that are
  indeed good.</font>

  tend to be orderly, primarily because the most commonly worshipped deity in
  Halas is the Tribunal. However, they are a wild people in a wild land, and not
  a few of them feel constrained by rules and follow the ways of discord. For

  society is orderly (as order is the only thing that keeps their society
  stable). But in some the urge for evil is unrestrained by the rules of their
  society, and there are discordant elements among the dark elves, primarily
  among those of the necromantic arts. Upward movement in the society of Neriak
  requires great cunning and self-control, however, and it is rare that those
  who do not posses orderly minds gain power in those circles. But dark elves
  are driven by all kinds of hatred– wild, flaring, dangerous hatred as well
  as cold, seething, dangerous hatred. (OE/NE – DE )</font>

  continuous battle with the evil of the goblins, they will stray toward

  become even more dedicated to the ideals of peace and order since their civil
  war gave a face to those among them who were dedicated to evil. It isn't

  among the Iksar of Cabilis. Those who are too disorderly are exiled into the
  wilderness of Kunark, where most find only death. Those who are too weak are
  often killed trying to prove their strength. Their single-minded acceptance of
  Fear has given their society its strength, and has given them the reputation
  as a terrible and dangerous people. (OE – NE)</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">New news and more clarifications:
First, I ran across a great suggestion on a message board as to how to refer to
the server. It will be listed on the server selection screen as follows :</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Firiona Vie (Role-playing
preferred)</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Also, to clarify some
misunderstandings about emotes:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The /emote command will use the
language you are speaking, so it's not used to get around language restrictions.
The canned emotes (for example, /smile, /wave, etc.), will still be readable by
all, even if you don't understand the language spoken by the character smiling
or waving.</font>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Here is a question
for you.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Who did the
sunsets in EQ?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I mean, wow. =)</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The sky in EverQuest is actually a
descendant of the sky used in our earlier game, Tanarus and was primarily coded
by Shawn Baird. Then after it was put into EverQuest, John Buckley (graphics
programmer) and Rosie Cosgrove (art lead) tweaked it a bit more. Then Scott
McDaniel (art lead) and others added some additional skies (the desert sky, the
Plane of Fear sky, etc.) It mostly involves taking a sky bitmap and then
algorithmically modifying the colors and tints depending on the time of day to
make it look like morning, noon, or night.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I agree, wow.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Why can't
character models be placed in the zone files for every zone rather than the
global files? Might require a huge download but maybe you could just upload an
exe that patches the extra data to every file or something.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The idea behind having global and
local zone character model files is to keep the memory footprint down (as well
as load times, but this is a secondary concern). In other words, it makes sense
to not load a bunch of character models that will never show up in the zone
you're in.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The global file exists for the
much smaller subset of character models that could potentially be displayed in
all zones (this would include all the player races and genders, pets, etc.). We
purposely try to keep this file small, and we also have limits as to how many
NPC models should be present in a zone specific file in order to keep memory
requirements reasonable. That said, because min specs rise over time and RAM
becomes cheaper, we've slowly but surely added to the global file and will most
likely continue to do so in the future.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Some questions
about the Luclin engine:</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">1.) Will the
weather effects be improved in the game? Will we have wind, swaying wind, snow
etc? Also, will weather be more gradual and not just 'pop' in and out like it
does now?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We don't have specific plans to
modify the weather by the Shadows of Luclin release, no. I'd love to see it
enhanced later though, perhaps combined with a newer, more advanced particle
engine (would allow us to do cool thinks like lightning bolts and such).</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">2.)Are spell
effects going to be improved? Will they look better and will we see any updates
to the spell icons?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Same as above - not specifically
for Luclin no, but definitely on our long-term list of cool things to do.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">3.)Will the UI be
usable in full screen mode now? Currently I cannot read a book or open my spell
book from fullscreen.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Much more of the UI will work in
full screen mode, and it will also be more flexible and configurable, and it
should also over time support other character/language sets. This is an ongoing
project, though, that you'll see patched in over time.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Whose picture is
on the book in the library on the second floor of Tower of Frozen Shadows? The
book is lying open on the first circular desk, and when you get near it you get
a warning to stay out. Come on, who is it?????</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Is it YOU? =)</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Nope, not me. That's Ronnie
Ashlock, the artist who I believe created that object.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I posted this on
Voodoo Extreme but you haven't done an Ask Brad there in awhile so I'll post it
here =)</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Okay, way back in
the hay day of computer gaming, there was one computer that really stood apart
from the rest of the &quot;Game boxes&quot; out there, the Commodore 64.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">For me it was the superior Atari
8bit line of machines, but I don't want to re-start that old debate</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">What made the
Commodore so much better than the rest in my opinion? The ability of users to
make games, and share them in magazines like &quot;Computer Gazzette&quot; and
&quot;Compute!&quot;.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, I remember typing in huge,
long strings of machine code using BASIC DATA statements - was fun, but I'd
always make lots of typos</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Move ahead a few
years and you get the Diku Mud phase. What made a Diku mud like Duris so
wonderful? The overwhelming vastness of it all really =) Unlimited zones, zones
created just for one use some times. I know when I was a God (Same as a GM, only
roleplayed better ;-)) I would often create a zone, and drag a party into it,
then remove the zone when I was finished with it.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Duris was awesome, as was Sojourn
(which I preferred because it wasn't PvP).</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Now, looking
forward, do you ever intend to open up the game to outside designers? Create a
method for out side folks to create dungeons that would be submitted to you.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I mean, really,
most of your new dungeons don't have new character models, or if new one's were
needed you could have someone develop a few in house.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Yay, look,
Frogloks, Rats, Spiders, Bats... etc... etc...</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I guess the reason
I ask is that our server is swamped with people, and the ability to add a new
level 55-60 type dungeon every two months would really heighten the game
experience and make the world seem more vast than the tiny crowded place we all
dwell in today.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">140 people in TOV
per night should say *something*.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As difficult and careful the gods
of those MUDs had to be when accepting and then balancing player submitted
zones, it would be even harder and more time consuming for us. So much so, in
fact, that it's simply more efficient to hire artists and game designers and
have them make our zones in-house.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That said, I think eventually as
both tools and the games themselves improve and expand, this sort of thing might
very well be doable. I think upcoming games like Neverwinter Nights, while not
truly MMOGs, will still help significantly in getting the industry and
technology to the point where user generated content is a reality.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Question: For SOL,
Would it be better for me to upgrade (see the following):</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My 128 RD-RAM to
256 RD-RAM<br>
Or<br>
My Geforce2 32meg(RD)4xAGP to Geforce3(yada,yada)<br>
Or<br>
My PIII 866 to PIII 1ghz?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, you've got a pretty nice
machine there already, and it's definitely above min spec. If you still plan on
upgrading, though, I'd think the additional RAM would help the most - more RAM
means less swapping and better load times. After that, more CPU is always good.
As for a Geforce 3, we're not doing much that would give it a significant
advantage over a Geforce 2.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I am just curious
about something about SoL. I heard that it won't be like Velious in the sense
that it won't take 2985798237598237598237589237598 people to fight in a zone. I,
like so many other people, am not in an &quot;uber&quot; guild. I am sick and
tired of not being able to do jack in most of Velious because I'm not in one. I
don't think just because someone is in a great guild that only they should get
the good items. Am I correct in thinking that SoL will be more toward a group or
two? I really hope so.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You're correct - the majority of
the content will be geared more for a group or two. But that's not to say there
won't be some raid content, and please also remember that loot from raid level
encounters will almost always be better than loot from less difficult
encounters. Keep in mind that it's our desire that EverQuest ultimately appeal
to all sorts of gamers, from the most causal all the way to the most &quot;uber&quot;,
and everyone in-between.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have a question
regarding the changes with SoL and armor. They will be changed to attach to the
players rather than be new skins on the model, correct?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Both, actually. Some items will
change the skins, and some will change both the skins and the character's
geometry. Another neat feature is that when we tint these different skins and
other textures, it won't necessarily change the color of the texture underneath
- in other words, the new character models also support texture layering.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Will people who
choose to view the old models for chars see armor added onto the model? Or just
the new models?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just the new models - the old
models were not created to take advantage of this new technology.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Also, will armor
be visible on some illusions, like skeletons?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Many of the pets/illusions are
being re-done, but we don't plan on having extensive armor choices for them
right away. That said, it does put us in a much better position to add them
later.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have Kunark,
Velious and plan to get Luclin. My first question is, will I be able to see the
revamped character models in old zones? Such as Gfay, BB, WC, etc, etc, or will
they only be visible on the moon?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, if you purchase Luclin you'll
be able to see the new character models in ALL zones.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Also, if I *don't*
purchase SoL, will I be able to see the Vah Shir running around?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, you'll still be able to see a
Vah Shir.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">And will I be able
to use any of the new items?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">And will I see new
character textures, or will they all be old looking, and the Vah Shir will look
revamped?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yes, if you don't upgrade to
Luclin you'll see the Vah Shir but not the other new character models, nor their
new textures and geometry.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">This is all kinda
confusing and not very well written probably; oh well, hope you can understand
what I'm saying.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">No worries - the whole character
model visibility issue is definitely a little confusing, and I appreciate the
opportunity to clarify even further.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have a question:
why do you make all green mobs aggro when you enter dungeons? I get attacked by
very deep greens in areas like Paw, Sol A, Runnyeye, Dalnir, and Cazic-Thule?</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Is it possible
that you will make the mobs know when they can and can't be beat? It is
embarrassing for a level 50 caster to need assistance in a zone that could be
easily soloed if the mobs didn't all aggro.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I know this would
be hard to change that fast but is it possible that the lower level mobs won't
be able to bash a high level caster every time? This is probably to prevent
farming in mid-level zones but it would make more sense if a monster didn't
attack something that could kill it in one blow. It is unfair to the classes
that do not melee or have no pets.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are really two reasons that
green mobs still attack characters in most dungeons.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">First, from an immersive
standpoint, it doesn't make sense that an enemy could just cruise into a dungeon
unimpeded. The mobs in a sense are attacking you as a group, in hope that
they'll force you to flee or even kill you, even though they'll probably die
themselves.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And from a game balance stand
point, since there are many zones with green 'yard trash' but challenging 'boss'
mobs, we don't really want players just waltzing through a dungeon to their
target. There still needs to be at least some risk associated with doing so.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All in all, when this does happen,
it probably (but not always) means that the level range differential in the zone
is too great. And in 20/20 game design hindsight, this should typically be
avoided - it's generally better that dungeons have a smaller level range
differential.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have seen that
most of the servers have some degree of significance in the choice of their
names. I'm a Drinal player and am wondering if the name/word &quot;Drinal&quot;
has any significance to it.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">At this point, all that is known
is that Drinal is the name of one of the moons that orbits Norrath (Luclin,
obviously, being the other one). Whether there is a god or demi-god associated
with the name and/or the moon (as there is with Luclin) is unknown… some
legends, however, claim that Drinal wasn't always cold and lifeless, so perhaps
its demi-god is dead or forgotten…</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I've been playing
EverQuest off/on since the early beta days. The game is phenomenal, and I know
you guys have a ton to be proud of; watching EQ grow over the years to become
what it has, has been amazing.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">EQ does a
wonderful job, IMO, of mastering &quot;combat&quot; in a massive multiplayer
environment. Each class is useful, and at the same time, they all need each
other. I've played many of the competitor's games, and none of them can even
come close to making combat as in-depth, balanced, and diverse as EQ. There are
just so many ways to handle encounters in EQ, and strategy and
&quot;skilled&quot; play is incredible.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">My only beef with
the game is the lack of &quot;interaction&quot; in the world. The social aspect
of EQ is so engrossing, it only seems appropriate that there be
&quot;social&quot; things to do in the game. Obviously, the engine for EQ was
never made with this in mind, but I was wondering if this was being taken
seriously in terms of future endeavors from Verant? You guys really have one
aspect of the genre mastered, IMO, in terms of balance, combat, class diversity,
etc, but it just lacks that one &quot;community&quot; feel in terms of guilds,
trade skills, vendors, owning property, decorating, etc.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Again, good luck
with Luclin, and keep up the good work.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We appreciate the praise, as well
as the perceptive observations.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When designing an MMORPG one can
pretty much approach it from one of two directions: depth or breadth. Sure, we'd
all love an MMORPG with both, but that's a lot easier said than done.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So with EverQuest we decided to
focus primarily on combat and adventure, and we are indeed proud of the depth,
content, and game mechanics associated with 'dungeon crawling' and the like. And
while it was a conscious choice to do this, we've certainly nothing against
other games that focused initially on breadth (these are typically the skill
based systems, which offer a lot more choices but less long-term detail in their
various professions or skill-trees).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Will we at Verant ever pursue
other aspects of character development or other advancement mechanisms? Well,
actually, we already are. Star Wars: Galaxies is definitely a game focused
initially more on breadth and player options. In fact, the Creative Director on
the project, Raph Koster, was one of the lead designers on Ultima Online, which
is also a skill based, breadth-focused game. So we're confident that SW:G will
truly be the next step in the evolution of MMORPGs as they relate to a variety
of professions and other less combat oriented paths of advancement (not that
there won't be awesome battles there as well).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Also, as we enter the age of
second generation MMORPGs (of which SW:G is one) I think we'll see games focused
on breadth become more and more detailed. And while EverQuest will always retain
the depth you see now in terms of combat and adventure, I wouldn't rule out, at
least long term, the exploration of other advancement mechanisms. After all,
everyone's really after both depth and breadth, and it's just a matter of
choosing a starting point and then sticking with MMORPG development, iteratively
making better and better games, each generation.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I hope this comes
to the right place. I did a follow up on the ask Brad column of 9/1/01.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">As a pen-and-paper
role-player I have had thoughts on creating a world of my own for quite some
time now and I know the tremendous amount of work that is involved.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">What I would like
to know is if there is more to Norrath than we can see today or if you are just
expanding as you go along. Adding content on the fly, as it were, can cause a
lot of problems when meshing existing content with new content but it is
certainly possible.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I'm not after any
specific information but just curious if you have a secret &quot;master
atlas&quot; that you use when adding new places and new content?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Both, really. We do indeed have
atlases and quite an extensive set of documents describing the world of Norrath,
and it grows every day. There is a lot of detail regarding many places, events,
and persons that either haven't been introduced yet in EverQuest or merely
alluded to. There are also, as people have noticed, many places on the maps that
come with the game to which you can't travel (yet ). The majority of those
places have at least some pre-existing content associated with them, and many
have even more. And then when a game designer sits down to work on a new area or
to revamp an existing area, he often consults these documents, afterwards adding
to them in detail.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Do you prefer
Ketchup, or Mayo with your Fries?</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ketchup, although I really like
Mayo on my hamburgers, which some people think is strange. *shrug*</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Can you tell us
what database EQ uses? Is it relational? Curious minds want to know. The current
rumor is that EQ uses flat files, but that seems a bit ... well, unlikely.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We store virtually all of the data
associated with the world in a relational database, but then we export that data
to flat files which are then typically loaded into memory so it can be rapidly
accessed. That way the game designers can manipulate and query the data using
the advantages of a database, but when it's time to place that data into a live,
playable server, the data can be accessed at the speeds necessary for a real
time, massively multiplayer game.</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Hello all,</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Given that we are
very close to launching the new server into live beta, I wanted to talk a bit
about it and give you a ‘closer to final’ feature list (although it’s
still very subject to change).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">First, just what
are we going to call it ? As I’d mentioned in an earlier post, we do hesitate
to call it an ‘RP’ server for two reasons :</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">1. We feel all of
our servers are Role Playing Servers and that EverQuest is indeed a Role Playing
Game.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">2. We feel it’s
pretty much impossible to define what Role Playing is verbally, much less via a
rule set.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The idea then came
up to call it the ‘Alignment’ server, since a character’s alignment is
pretty key to many of the features we’re implementing. But, to me, that still
doesn’t speak to what the server is really all about. From my perspective
it’s an RP server, an Alignment server, a hard-core ‘Seige Perilous’ style
server, and, quite simply, an experiment server, where we’re implementing some
potential ideas for the long-term future, as well as some features we’d
probably have put in the game originally, given 20/20 hindsight.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">So, from here
forward, I’m just going to call it by its server name, Firiona Vie (in fact,
while we’re waiting on the Nameless to create more gods, we plan on naming
future servers after Heroes and other prominent mortals in Norrath’s
illustrious history). We don’t mind if you still call it the RP Server, or
whatever else you’re so inclined, but we’re going to stick to using its
‘proper’ name.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Lastly, before I
list the features, I do want to say the following again: This feature set will
undoubtedly be controversial. It will also undoubtedly NOT be consistent with
many players’ views as to what an RP server or any other server should be. In
fact, this is (combined with having less servers overall in the past) why
we’ve been hesitant to launch such a server. But we’re going forward with
this anyway, and we hope it will make an interesting and even possibly better
EverQuest. And we hope that some if not many players will enjoy it.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">At the very least,
it sure will be a different server</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Firiona Vie Server Feature List :</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· This is a new server, not a
split server. Nor will there be any transfers to this server.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· This is a PvE (Player vs.
Environment) server, NOT a PvP (Player vs. Player) server. In other words,
it’s a standard ‘blue’ server with the same rules and features regarding
PvP as the vast majority of our servers. It is not one of the ‘Zeks’.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· Auction restricted to city
zones: Qeynos, Surefall Glade, Highkeep, Freeport, Rivervale, Erudin, Halas,
Neriak, Grobb, Oggok, Greater Faydark, Ak'Anon, Kaladim, Felwithe, Paineel,
Cabilis, Kael and Thurgadin.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· Beneficial buff spells will not
work on characters 20 levels lower than the caster.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· Very few items will be No-Drop.
Exceptions will include things such as newbie notes and epic weapons.<br>
<br>
· Each character will be assigned an &quot;alignment&quot; upon creation. This
alignment will be described in brief on the character creation screen (in the
same location the their Deity is described).<br>
<br>
· Each character will be able to change their alignment once any time after
they reach 10th level. The player will be able to chose from a list of
alignments based on their race, class and deity.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· A character's alignment will
determine whether or not they can group or guild with other characters.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· A character's alignment will
determine an experience bonus or penalty when grouping with other characters.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· A character's alignment will
determine if they can cast beneficial spells on other characters (including
resurrections).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· Language skills will improve
only through group chat in the same zone and from /say.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· Languages will only improve 1
point each hour and will be capped at level*5+5 skill points.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· Common will not exist. A Human
language will be added and only made easily available to certain races.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· One character per account per
server.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· The Trivial Loot Code will be
in effect in all zones.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· Bind Affinity will be
restricted for all characters to locations where melee characters can bind on
other servers.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· /emote will be language
specific</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· All characters will be /roleplay.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">· /alignment will display the
alignment of your character and probably a more detailed description of that
alignment.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Spell Changes</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We have removed the changes to
bard song stacking that were made with the recent emergency patch. We will be
reviewing those changes for possible update in a future patch.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Item Changes</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- The Shaman Epic effect has been
returned to its previous effect (and it should conflict with fewer Damage over
Time spells, as was the intention for the change made last patch).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Quest Changes</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Ivory Sky Diamond is now
dropping as it should.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Fixed an error in a Stonebrunt
quest where an NPC was handing out the wrong reward.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Miscellaneous</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Added some code that might fix a
bug with female hair and Erudite hoods that caused them to fail to appear
sometimes when a helmet was removed. This would cause some characters to look as
though the back of their head was missing at times.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Mouselook will now work a little
differently when in the first two third-person camera modes (overhead and
chase). They will work similarly to first-person mouselook (i.e. your
character's heading will change when you move the mouse left or right, the left
and right movement keys will cause your player to strafe, and the camera angle
will pitch up or down when you move the mouse forward or back). These changes
should make those first two third-person camera modes more useful.</font>
