<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of Caerthiel</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Dragons had relinquished their hold over
Norrath, and what are now known as the elder races, the Elves and the Dwarves,
stepped out from under their gargantuan shadow. The Dwarves sprang forth from
the earth, to hold dominion over their mountainous kingdoms. The elves took to
the primeval forests of Norrath, creating a vast empire that spanned several
continents. Ruling from the city of Caerthiel , the Elves lived in peace, under
the guidance of Innoruk, the elven god.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of the rebellion and the
outpost of Wielle</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As the corruption in the empire grew, so did
the unrest in many elves hearts. They wanted more and more power for themselves.
They grew suspicious of the strength of Innoruk, choosing to destroy his works,
and kill his servants. At first they were small in size, and weak in power. But
as the years went by the rebels grew in leaps and bounds, using treacherous
methods to slander the leaders of the Elven Empire. The first sign of the
growing rebellion came at the Elven outpost of Wielle, located where the city of
Freeport is today. Wielle was loyal to the empire, and therefore, enemies of the
rebels. A rebel army under the captain Paetroen savagely attacked it. The
citizens of the outpost were killed.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That action shattered centuries of relative
peace. Suddenly the Empire had to face a new enemy, a darkness in its mist. The
Emperor, Kel'anthinstion, called on all of the citizens of the Empire to fight
for the cause of Innoruk. He sent his most trusted advisers, all disciples of
Innoruk, to the far reaches of the empire. They were to gather support to fight
the rebels and support the unity of the empire. The rebels had sent their own
recruiters using underhanded tactics to undermine the populace’s faith in
their God. The war droned on for countless years.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of the battle of Aerignon and
the Wild Elves</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The war was a stalemate. That changed with the
battle of Aerignon, named after the province of the empire where it took place.
The loyal forces of the empire thought to catch Paetroen and his rebels
unprepared. They attacked him at his home base, just north of Elizerain Lake.
Forces were massed and placed under the direct command of the Emperor himself.
He was to lead the army of Innoruk to destroy the rebels once and for all. As
the army encircled Peatroen's military headquarters, a victory for the blessed
forces of Innoruk seemed assured. Out maneuvered and outnumbered, the Rebels
could not get enough forces to turn back the impending assault, and escape by
any means, was impossible.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the imperial victory was denied that day,
as a third player in the war, the wild elves, tipped there hand. The wild elf
was a term used by citizens of the empire for the primitive elves the lived
beyond the borders of the empire. They had remained neutral throughout the war,
but had succumbed to the rebel’s promises of victory, and had joined the war
on their side. What was supposed to be a day of victory for the Empire turned
into its greatest defeat. The emperor himself was killed when an wild elf
assassin slipped into his tent and killed him from behind. On that day the
Empire was doomed.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of the fall of the Imperial
City</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The war lasted for several years after the
death of the emperor. In desperation, the remaining loyalists sent messengers to
the Dwarven Kingdoms for aid against the rebels. They returned, saying the
Dwarves were fighting their own war, and would send no help. With the help of
new fiendish magic, the Rebels pushed the loyalists back to their capital,
Caerthiel, which was in what is now known as the loping planes. Inside, the last
of the loyalists huddled in their homes, holding on to the last remnants of
their shattered empire. With out a leader to rally them, they were as good as
dead.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Help came in the form of a priest of Innoruk,
who rose up as leader. His name changes with every telling, but the fact remains
that in the dark of the night, the day before the final assault on Caerthiel,
the priest led the last of the loyalists in to the earth. Through a chasm that
was opened and closed by Innoruk himself. When the Rebel army assaulted the city
the next day, they found nothing but a ghost town, devoid of any life.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of the Elven schism Dark Elves
- High Elves - Forest Elves</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As the loyalists took refuge underground, the
rebels thought themselves the winners of the War of the Broken crown. They took
on the moniker &quot;High Elves&quot;, while the wild elves became more commonly
known as wood elves. Without the loyalists to guide it, the Empire fell apart.
The elves that remained on the surface, the high elves, could not stand the
symbol of Caerthiel, and in a fit of rage they destroyed it. They created their
capital of Felwithe on the very spot where the emperor was murdered, in the
battle that destroyed the empire. The loyalists fled east to the wild and
uncharted continent of Antonica. There they established the well guarded and
underground city of Neriak, where they stayed for many years trying to rebuild
their once great empire and all the while plotting for revenge against the
rebels who forced them from Faydwer. Having been exposed to decades of low light
in their underground kingdom and to harsh conditions, the skin of those elves
still loyal to Innoruk has become darker and the elves themselves have been made
into warriors guided by the power of their god. They are feared by the denizens
of Antonica, who call the loyalists &quot;dark elves.&quot;</font></p>
