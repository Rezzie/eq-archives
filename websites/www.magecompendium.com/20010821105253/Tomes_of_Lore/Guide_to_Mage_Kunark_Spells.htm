<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well mages, you may have wondered what the world
of Norrath holds for you now that the new world has opened. Well I don't have
much of the new lands explored, but I can tell you all about you new spells.
Almost all of them are right on the money on this site so I'll just hut up the
highlights.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Pets</b></font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Pet may disappoint you at first glance but I feel that they have done something
truly remarkable with our magician pets. True Variation. The days are now gone
when we summon a water pet because we are in sol b and LDC are immune to fire
spells. Here is what I've found our pets to be:<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Earth Pets</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Basically the same as other earth pets. Hard to tell but I believe more hp, and
more strength. I thing that the difference between Earth and the other pets is
much larger than it was before. Also the new spell Earth Elemental Strike is
root with a longer range and Level of pet + 10 damage.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Fire Pets</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
What the hell is wrong with fire pets? May be the first thing you think upon
summoning your first Voceration: Fire. Well nothing really, they no longer cast
FireElementalAura, it's been replace by the pathetic O'Keil's Radiation. They
also don't cast the FireElementalAttack spell anymore, they are little mini
wizards, so far I've seen them cast: Lightning, Shock of Force, some stun spell,
and both a hot and a cold spell. I believe that fire pets cast either 34 or 39
spells but that is going to take more investigation. The biggest problem with
fire pets is they are no longer tanks at all, without the old elemental aura for
Level of pet + 1 damage, and the long cast wizard spells, you really don't want
to summon this pet too much solo.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Air Pets</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Not much new about air pets as far as I've been able to tell. Their stun now
does damage (Level + 10) and seems to last a little longer, and I think the base
delay of air pets may have been reduced. I'm not much of a number cruncher so I
can't say for sure.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Water Pets</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Water pets haven't changed all that much. Their water strike spell now does
(level+10)X 2. but the nicest thing about water pets is seeing them backstab.
I've seen water pets backstab for up to 200 damage, but that may not be the cap,
who knows.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Dyzil's Deafening Decoy-</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
And what the hell is this you may ask. Well a summoned decoy is a truly unique
idea for pets. The Decoy looks like a big fire pet, and focus items don't seem
to work on it. It has a much lower damage potential than other pets, but seems
to have even more hp than earth pets. The decoy now casts the old
FireElementalAura spell, but the neatest thing about the Decoy is it's super
taunt AoE spell. It didn't seem to be 100% functional last time I played with
it, but this is supposed to get creatures REALLY mad at your pet to let you
nuke, run or what have you. I suspect this one will be VERY popular with
enchanters in places like Sol B, Guk, and all the fun new train dungeons that
Kunark will have for us. Careful, this spell has a very long Recycle Time.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Rage Of Zomm</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Summons a Holy Hand Grenade = ). Basically just a guided eye that blows things
up. Well I assume at least, at first the spell summoned pets named !Kibaer that
ran all the way across the zone and bugged you so you couldn't summon another
pet, now pets just die as soon as you summoned them in a little explosion that
doesn't seem to really hurt anymore.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Item Summons</b></font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Well some of these are pretty boring, other not so much. I'll leave it to you to
decide.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Gift of Xev</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Well you get a 10 slot backpack = ). Also 20 food/water/bandages. Not too bad,
I'll cast a lot of it I assume.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bristlebane's Bundle</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Summons a Firecracer, a bunch of Beer, Some Cake, and umm.... err I forget the
4th item *blush*<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Quiver of Marr</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
I believe these arrows have a little higher damage than normal arrows, also have
75 range instead of 50. Summons 3 stacks of arrows and a quiver.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Bandoleer of Lucin</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
I'll have to look and see what this spell summons, I now forget *blush*<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Pouch Of Quellios</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Get ready to make lots of Monkish and Roguish friends. With this spell you get
60 7/23 Shruriken with 100 range. They also have +3 to Agi and I think Dex. They
are rogue and monk only however.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Muzzle of Mardu</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Summons a haste mask. Gonna have to give it to brego or dravith to test = ).
Pretty useless for an item summon at level 56 since every tank I know has a
haste item. Last I checked there was no AC on the mask and no stat modifiers. So
unless it's SLTW speed I doubt anyone but newbies will be asking for these.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Offensive And Defensive Spells</b></font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Well here is everything else that doesn't fit into the above categories.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scintilation</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
An AOE shock of swords. Kind of fun for clearing green trash. Good way to die
still IMHO.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Malosi</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
We got a taste of it, now we ge it back. YAY!<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Char</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Its going to be everything I can do not to yel MANDER! every time I cast spell (pokemon
joke, yes I'm ashamed of myself as well). Decent damage ratio, upgrade in our
shock of flame line.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Phantom Armor</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
More AC, More Regen, More Cat's eye. Did you excpect something more?<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Annul Magic</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Dispell Magic upgrade.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Boon of Immolation</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Dammit you mean I gotta wait until I'm 53 to get my first group damage shield?
Well it costs as much as Lavashielding 3 tanks, I imagine I'll probably use it
in groups with 2 or more tanks (because I'm lazy). Doesn't hit pets unfortunatly.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shield of the Magi</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
More AC, More MR, More HP. Arch Shielding upgrade.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Scars of Sigil</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
My favorite offensive spell. I've been training myself with bolt targeting just
so this spell would be mine. At 150 mana, 450 damage and 4.0 casting time (2.0
recast), this spell is a machine gun. If you are outdoors you can try turning
your back on your target, the bolt will take a longer path and you'll be able to
get a few more into the air before the first hits.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Call of The Hero</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
YOU WILL NOT EVADE ME RILLO! Costs 1 pearl and 500 mana, is a slow cast and has
a slow recycle time, but it will summon a group member to you from anywhere in
the zone. I haven't tried it between zones yet, but I can't imagine it working
as there is no good way to target it. I hope (although I doubt) this spell works
in PoA, save us a fortune in coffin fees.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Sirocco</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Huge damage rain spell, but rains are bugged and your pets are counted as
targets hit. None the less a kind of fun spell outdoors vs tall targets (forest
giants and such)<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Eye Of Tallon</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
YES! Eye of Zomm Upgraded at last! It actually turns you invisible and makes and
invisible eye, but I think this probably works to make mobs not see your eye for
some odd reason. Also gives you see invis and some telescope effect. Interesting
scouting spell, and good fun in Plane of Air. (A spiroc lord says, 'TIRRANNA')<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Cadeau of Flame</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Bigger Flameshield...what did you expect?<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Exile Summoned</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
More damage than banish summoned. Save this one for when hole opens.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shock of Steel</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Damage on this spell could be higher, but I love this line of spells and I
imagine I'll be using this spell quite a bit. I think that at level 60 my
offensive spell list will pretty much always be Shock of Steel and Scars of
Sigil.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Malosini</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Upgrade to Malosi. Faster cast time, lower mana, same debuff I believe.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Velocity</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
SoW for your pet...you just have to wait for level 58...Grr.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Manastorm</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Interesting idea, it's aoe damage and mana tapping in a rain form. but still a
rain spell so is subject to high resists and only a few waves. Quag is gonna see
this spell, I owe him a few.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Seeking Flame of Seukor</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Big Badda Boom! Make things blow up. Bolt upgrade, nice for a show I guess.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Aegis of Ro</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Group Damage shield. Same damage as the last singe target damage shield for 3
times the mana cost. but you can't shake a stick at 33 damage now can you?<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Banishment</font>
</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
For the mere cost of a star ruby you can send one summoned creature back to
where it came from...oh it takes it's corpse and exp with it...<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Mala</font>
</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Listed some places as Malo, actually read Mala in my spell book. The debuffs on
this spell are pretty small, but it can't be saved against. Also last time I
tried Malosini overrode Malo. So for 550 mana you can make your Malosini harder
to resist. If you plan on doing this I recommend letting a friend cast one spell
or the other to lower the mana costs.
