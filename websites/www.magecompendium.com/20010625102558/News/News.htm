gentlemen there.<br>
<br>
My problem: Gloves of Fire (some stats, effect, no drop, mag/wiz) that
*censored* drops in *censored*.<br>
If you put these gloves on HIE or GNM they are awesome looking. The colour is
bright , even neon red. _The_ best looking gloves in the game.<br>
I was so thrilled when I got a pair of these. And I was sorely disappointed when
I put them on. They have a reddish, quite dark brown colour when they are on
Dark elf hands. :(<br>
<br>
Why is this? Why do they look so godly on other races and on dark elf they look
like you had been grovelling in mud a moment ago? Is there any way to get them
look on DEF the same as they look on HIE? Is this a bug or just a bad feature
because of some shading in graphics or such?<br>
<br>
I know, there is a plethora of more important things in the game yes. This one
just happened to affect me much. I was looking forward to them and I have red
dress and those 2 glowing red globes and the neon red fiery gloves would have
been exellent for my outlook. Now it's not so. Please (on my knees) could you
ask quickly about this from the graphics guy? Is there any way to get these
gloves look like they should on Dark Elfs?<br>
<br>
You know the saying (CP 2.0.2.0): Style before everything.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time and keep up the good work there.<br>
<br>
Sincerely<br>

PS. I wouldn't say no if You could give us mages the improved invis too :)]<br>
</font><br>
The answer is a little complicated.<br>
<br>
Each race has a look, a texture, to their armor pieces. When tinting a piece of
armor that tinting is, basically, placed on top of that texture (blended with
it, sorta). So the actual color of the armor after the tinting won't be uniform
for each race that wears it. This is, really, a good thing, adding variety to
the armors that we create. But it also means that there is no way to get a
uniform look across all the races.<br>
<br>
And, well, sorry about the Improved Invisibility thing. You get advantages, and
you get disadvantages. Not having Improved Invisibility is one of the
disadvantages.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Hello all,</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">It’s apparent
that as a result of the Fan Faire this weekend in Minneapolis, inaccurate
information regarding our PvP plans for the future were released and/or
misinterpreted.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">That has always
been one of the difficulties of having a real-time interactive discussion where
one doesn’t have the time to think about the precise wording of their answers.
However, what we gain through the interactive forum makes it worth the effort,
even when things appear to come out wrong like they did in the PvP panel this
weekend.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">For the most part,
regarding the information that has since shown up on web sites, it appears that
when it was mentioned that we “discussed” an issue, it was interpreted as
“we are doing this”. The fact is, we discuss a TON of things when we’re
driven to improve one area of the game. If you name it, we’ve probably
discussed it at one time or another. That doesn’t necessarily mean that what
we discussed has either been decided or shot down, just that we’ve given it
some measure of consideration in the past.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, with
that in mind, here’s the quote-by-quote clarification of the story on
Castersrealm (</font><a href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/" target="_blank"><span style="background-color: #000000"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">eq.castersrealm.com</font></b></span></a><font size="2" face="Verdana">)
and RallosZek.net. (</font><a href="http://www.ralloszek.net/" target="_blank"><span style="background-color: #000000"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">www.ralloszek.net</font></b></span></a><font size="2" face="Verdana">).</font></font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">In approximately
  one week, PvP 'rules' will be as on Sullon Zek. In other words, there are no
  rules with respect to PvP. Standard blue server rules apply and sexual/racial
  harassment will not be tolerated. Everything else (training/bind point
  camping/exp killing, etc) will be completely legal. No PvP related petitions
  will be handled by the CS staff. The standard blue server type problems such
  as lost corpses, bugs, lost items, etc will still be handled.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
Sure, we discussed it, much like we discuss anything. As we were putting
together the ruleset for Sullon Zek, someone suggested that we role it out
across Sullon first and see how that goes and role it across the other servers
if it works out. Will it go across the other servers? We don’t know. We’ll
have to see how it goes on Sullon first.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">ShowEQ is
  actively being pursued to be 'fixed'.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: As
actively as “bang for the buck” allows. We really need to do something
revolutionary and complex in our next attempt to address the problem. It’s
just a matter of having enough time to implement and test that. Timeframe?
Mid-term, probably prior to Luclin’s launch.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Classes are
  being re-examined for viability in a PvP environment. Lady Daegarmo
  specifically mentioned rangers as being one of the classes that is woeful in
  PvP.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
…with nothing specific planned and nothing beyond minor tweaks, certainly
nothing class-redefining planned. Regarding rangers there was talk about
improving archery, but that was spoken of with plans to put something out across
all servers rather than just as a PvP-related improvement. The truth is, the
classes are not balanced for one-on-one PvP, no more than they are balanced for
one-on-one PvE (Player versus Environment). If you have to fight as part of a
group to be successful in PvE, you’ll most likely have to do so with PvP. Yes,
this does mean that a solo melee player will be at a disadvantage when meeting
casters, especially those configured for solo play, and yes, that is part of the
plan.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Lady Daegarmo is
  pushing for the return of egg shaped pumice on vendors for approx 200P each.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: Oh
it’s been pushed, but has yet not been taken up by the dev team for
consideration. We’re kind of like the supreme court that way.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">It was noted
  that Harm Touch and Lay Hands are on the same spell function with opposite
  effects so there's no way to give Lay Hands back to paladins on death while
  restricting the same recycle on HT.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: Not
entirely accurate. The reuse time is not tied to the spell effect, not to
mention that each ability is treated as a skill by the game and uses its own
reuse timer. The reason it’s not being done is not a matter of technical
unfeasibility, but rather a specific design decision not to. Both are easy to
exploit. The level to which they can be exploited is acceptable on the PvE
servers and not acceptable on the PvP servers.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Cross teaming is
  coming to an end. Teams (see later notes) will be locked down. There will be
  no ability to crossteam at all. No grouping, guilding, buffing, etc with
  non-team members. This lockdown is probably 60 days out. (I stated that the
  Development team would make an official date on the lock down in which they
  would give a minimal of 30 day notice. I also stated that I doubted you would
  see these changes within the next 2 months.)</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
Yep, we’re planning on addressing cross-teaming, probably through locking down
the teams. However, the specifics on how this will be done, along with what if
any beneficial abilities will be allowed to cross any lock down is still being
discussed. Opinions are welcome.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">The lockdown
  will entail a guildwipe. All guilds will be deleted and must be reformed.
  There will be extra staff for the first few days after the wipe to assist in
  this endeavour.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: If
we decided to do the most severe lockdown (no cross-guilding), then this would
probably be the case. However something like this won’t be decided until we
decide what kind of lockdown we’ll do.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">It is highly
  likely that common (the language) will be removed from the racewar servers for
  general communication use (i.e., public channels). Training in non-team
  languages will also receive very low caps.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: No.
While this was one of the many thing suggested as part of a panel discussion, it
has only been discussed as one of the many possible options for an “RP
Server”, for lack of a better term, by the development team. The “RP
Server”, by the way, will not be PvP. Those looking for PvP rules similar to
an “RP Server” should look towards Sullon Zek.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Strong
  possibility of adding a long (40 or so hours) quest to change your team.
  Certain classes/races would not be allowed to join certain teams (such as a
  Paladin joining the evil team).</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: No.
It was one of the suggestions brought up by players in the panel discussion, and
has not been discussed by the development team. However, I can say with some
certainty that this probably won’t happen.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">TZ likely to be
  changed to a 2 team server (Good vs. Evil). VZ may be changed to a 3 team
  server.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
These were ‘off the cuff’ examples of how a lock down could possibly be
accomplished, rather than an indication of the direction planned. To clarify
further, we previously decided not to implement a 2-team system, and are
considering a 3 team system, by race, due to the percentage breakdown of players
on each team currently.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Rallos will
  always remain coin + 1 item loot. Code for rain spells is currently being
  changed to not effect your pet or your immediate group.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification: Yep
and Yep, but no ETA.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">Sullon Zek will
  be live within 3 weeks.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
Probably within a week actually baring major problems coming up.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">There's
  discussion about adding a new Guildwar server with no 'teams' but lockdowns
  based on your guild.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
This was previously discussed and ruled out by the development team, as it would
be insufficiently differentiated from the current servers. In other words, most
of everything that would be doable on the “guildwar” server is currently
doable on Rallos, or one of the existing teams for that matter.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">On Sullon, the
  new summon corpse mechanism for good races will be obtained via a quest which
  likely involves PvP/crests of fallen opponents.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Clarification:
This is accurate. In fact I’ll tell you now that Mages are in line to gain the
ability on Sullon. And no, we won’t roll it out that way on other servers</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">I hope this gives
everyone a better idea of what we have planned for the near and mid-terms.
We’ll work to be a little more explicit about what is currently planned or not
planned to avoid misunderstandings in the future.</font>

sent me this update to pass on to all of you.<br>
</font><br>
Hey guys, as I get ready to head out for the Fan Faire I wanted to sit down and
write up this post I've been putting off all week. A couple quick notes.<br>
<br>
The &quot;problem&quot; with rain spell pulses always being resisted if they
will be the killing blow isn't actually a problem....It's an intentional design
feature. The problem was much like the old DOT corpse poof buf. If the Rain
killed the NPC and the server was unsure where the damage came from the corpse
would poof, so these spells were coded in this manner to prevent that from
happening. I'm working with the coders to come up with a better solution. We're
all pretty busy right now so unfortunately I can't give you a time frame on when
a better solution will be implemented.<br>
<br>
Kunark Evac spells: these will now work anywhere in the world. You won't have to
be in a Kunark dungeon to use them. This change will apply to both Wizards and
Druids evac spells.<br>
<br>
Druid Spell Egress: this spell will now work indoors. It didn't make sense for
the group version to work indoors (a mistake on our part) and not have the self
version work indoors.<br>
<br>
Shroud of Death: I added Illusion Skeleton to shroud of death on test
server..... I removed it the next day I just didn't get to update spells on
test. I forgot that in skeleton form trolls and ogres would lose slam, sorry for
the scare. I'll see if I can think up some other way to give SKs skeleton form.<br>
<br>
Stacking issues: I continue to address these as time permits. We're working on
some changes that will allow me to fix them much easier. More stacking issues
should be resolved in the coming months. High level players should be pleased to
know that I'm 99.99999% certain that Call of Earth and Speed of the Shissar will
no longer conflict after the next patch.<br>
<br>
New Translocates: as many of you know there are new translocate spells up on
test. I'm not going to comment on these other than to say you can expect that
cool cat Al'Kabor to be out and about researching again.<br>
<br>
Now on to the &quot;Burning issue&quot;. I know the Wizard community has been
*patiently* awaiting the enhancement we have been working on The coding for the
new spell effect has been finished and it is going through extensive internal
testing. It has also been on Test Server for a week, but I doubt you would have
seen it in a parser – cause I'm sneaky like that. Before I go into details on
the new spells there's a few things I'd like to say. Honestly I feel that
wizards are balanced fine from a power standpoint, to that end you will not be
receiving an upgrade to your damage output. Where I do feel wizards need help is
group utility.<br>
<br>
As I'm sure you can understand coming up with a highly desirable utility type
spell for an EverQuest wizard is not an easy task. I've spent countless hours
pondering a solution, I've read countless message board forums and emails
looking at suggestions from you guys. Finally a solution was found! I'm not
naive enough to believe that everyone will be happy about the new enhancement
but this is an idea I've seen tossed around on a number of forums and I think
not only does it fit in well with wizards being the masters of arcane
transportation, I think it will make them very desirable in the 50 to 60 levels
where they seem to be struggling for usefulness.<br>
<br>
The new spells will give wizards the ability to prevent NPCs from gating. There
will be 3 versions of the spells starting at level 51. They will each have a
different resistance type. One of the problems with duration based effects is
stacking and negating the need for multiple characters of the same class. I am
designing these spells with that in mind. If you want to 100% ensure an NPC does
not gate you will need more than one wizard. I understand this may upset some
people but the need for multiple wizards to &quot;Anchor&quot; an NPC won't
really happen until you fight the more epic mobs with higher hit point numbers.
For single group encounters one wizard with these spells should, in most
situations, be enough to get the job done. My plan is to get these spells
implemented and ready to go before the next patch.<br>
<br>
Lastly I would like to send a huge thank you to all the players who have
reported stacking exploits to me through Email, IRC, and ICQ over the past
couple of months. The feedback is greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Take care all!<br>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I've made a few
posts about the possible future of all the Iksar class quests and if they will
be brought to logical completion, but have never recieved any kind of response.
I thought this would fall under the category of new topics, but i guess not. If
this subject has already been addressed I was wondering if you could repost your
comments about it. I haven't been able to find any info on the matter.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All of the Iksar quests are
technically finished. All the ones that exist can be completed. Only the
Greenmist quest even implies that there is a chance that the quest might be
extended.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That being said, there are plans
to extend some of these quests at some time in the future. I don't know when
that will be.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Just one little
thing I have given some thought to in the past. In a way its modeled after the
change that came to the xp bar. The smaller line down the middle of the xp bar
that represented the percentage of a yellow bubble.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have wondered
for some time if it would be possible to do something similar on the group list.
However in this case the line drawn down the middle of each players health
status bar would represent how much mana that person currently has. Now I know
this would add to the amount of information be sent out to the clients, but I
always thought it would be an interesting addition.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We don't have any plans to
implement something like that. There really is no way that your character would
know that status of your friends' magical energy. You can look at them and get
an idea as to how wounded they are, but knowing their mana isn't something that
we see as part of the game. I know there have been a lot of requests for this
feature and others this it (one that asked for a %M that would report your
percentage mana for macros). But we just don't see that as part of the game.</font>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Quote
- Number 1 sounds like it might be a bug. Pretty rare case, but I'll pass that
on to Ester.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Very nice of you
to finally mention this, as I have personally submitted detailed information
regarding this very case.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">A couple things:</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">1) It is NOT a
rare case. This is an absolute fact, which happens every time a pet owner gets
charmed. I can personally duplicate this to any VI staff in-game as many times
as they wish. GM's have replied to my /bugreport and /petition's saying it is
intentional to force pet owners to camp or zone after getting charmed to regain
the ability to summon / resummon a pet.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">2) I have
personally submitted this very problem to these boards in excess of 5 times. I
have used /bug and /petition in-game over a dozen times submitting this very
problem. So, though I am only one person, VI has heard of this bug many times.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">3) Bug or
intentional, it is NOT fair in &quot;any&quot; circumstance for pet owners to be
stripped of their ability to summon / resummon their pet. If this is a bug,
please fix it promptly. If this is intentional, please seek employment
elsewhere.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">4) The &quot;rogue
pet&quot; fix only removed the ability for players to create a rogue pet without
the intervention of a NPC. A pet which is charmed by a NPC will become a
experience-giving KOS to everybody NPC if the pet owner zones.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have personally
had my level 54 water pet get charmed by the level 30ish NPC enchanter at the
lake in Qeynos Hills. When I zoned back, there was my old water pet, scowling,
and killing all NPC's that came within range, including the original NPC which
charmed it. Fortunately, the pet gives pretty good experience per kill.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When I said that it sounded like a
rare case, I meant just that. It's probably not that common that you get
charmed. I have no problem believing that it happens every time you DO get
charmed, just that being charmed isn't something that happens every day to a
character.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I looked it up. The bug has
been in the database since December. So we are aware of it, and have been.
Obviously we haven't been quick to fix the bug, but we are certainly aware of
it.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I commend Verant
for giving this to all the pet classes, and realizing it has little to do with
roleplay, balance, or power but is a nice solution to some gameplay limitations
(i.e., pathing). Just why did it take you so long to reach that decision after
granting it to Mages? This will be a big help to the main pet classes - mages
and necros and is the appropriate level at 44 as at lvl 46 planes and bigger
raids begin for most charaters.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Now if you would
only do something about fear and resists for necro pets it just might provide
the necro with one of their primary weapons in raids/epic encounters.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, this is a case where were
conflicted. There was a feeling that we should try to further distinguish
magicians and their power over their pets, and also the feeling that it would be
a useful tool for any pet caster.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We decided to err (if we were
indeed erring) on the side of caution and give it only to magicians (imagine the
issues if we gave it to everyone first and then decided to make it a magician
only spell…). After letting it stew a while, we've decided to change our
minds.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As for the fear thing… you'll
have to wait a bit and see what or if we do anything with that. The same issue
applies here. But, unlike Summon Companion, there is no clear need for fear
resistance as a matter of a gameplay issue. It is something to consider for a
'class balance' issue, but that issue is two-sided.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Please don't give
this spell to Enchanters..</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Enchanters mess
with the Mind and Enchant lumps of stuff..</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I do not want the
ability to &quot;Summon&quot;. I am distinctly an Enchanter not a generic
&quot;Caster&quot; and dont want to be treated in such a way.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Provide me a
roleplaying reason why Enchanters now have the ability to Summon. Then give me
access to other Summoning abilities.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of all the responses we've
received on this issue, this is the kind that has baffled me the most.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Several enchanters have responded
saying that this spell won't help them and that they don't want it. I suggest
that you will find it useful in some cases. And, well, who in the world would
say no to a new spell? Seems odd to me.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As for your concern that there is
no 'roleplaying' reason to have it, I have the easy answer. Don't buy it if it
doesn't fit your concept of an enchanter.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Does this spell
wipe pets aggro list? If it doesnt i think it should. Would be totally pointless
if a enc summoned his pet back and it just took off after the mob it was on
again.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">There's no need
for that. If the pet has something on its hate list, that something will have
the pet on its hate list, and the spell won't work anyhow.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Not to ruffel any
feathers, but isnt't the reasoning for giving all pet casters the summon pet
spell contrary to the same reason you won't allow other (than necro) pet casters
get voice graft? As you stated with regards to Summon Companion, it's not
balance issue.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I personal can't
stand playing the straight caster classes, but for those who do, voice graft
I've seen to be used as a nice way for the friendly comedicly inclined players
to pass the time while on their rears. I'd imagine the necromancers out there
wouldnt mind giving Goner someone to chat with who was likewise summoned to to
anothers bidding. I can even see it now: Goner &amp; Jibantik- of course, the
militia wouldnt enjoy their jokes if the casters brought their act to the stage
in freeport!</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is certainly a possibility that
all pet classes could get Voice Graft. There is no compelling gameplay reason
that they shouldn't have it.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But, at the same time there is no
compelling gameplay reason that they should. There was such a reason for Summon
Companion. So I don't foresee a change for Voice Graft, but you never know.</font>
