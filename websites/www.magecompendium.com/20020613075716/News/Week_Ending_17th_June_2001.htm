sent me this update to pass on to all of you.<br>
</font><br>
Hey guys, as I get ready to head out for the Fan Faire I wanted to sit down and
write up this post I've been putting off all week. A couple quick notes.<br>
<br>
The &quot;problem&quot; with rain spell pulses always being resisted if they
will be the killing blow isn't actually a problem....It's an intentional design
feature. The problem was much like the old DOT corpse poof buf. If the Rain
killed the NPC and the server was unsure where the damage came from the corpse
would poof, so these spells were coded in this manner to prevent that from
happening. I'm working with the coders to come up with a better solution. We're
all pretty busy right now so unfortunately I can't give you a time frame on when
a better solution will be implemented.<br>
<br>
Kunark Evac spells: these will now work anywhere in the world. You won't have to
be in a Kunark dungeon to use them. This change will apply to both Wizards and
Druids evac spells.<br>
<br>
Druid Spell Egress: this spell will now work indoors. It didn't make sense for
the group version to work indoors (a mistake on our part) and not have the self
version work indoors.<br>
<br>
Shroud of Death: I added Illusion Skeleton to shroud of death on test
server..... I removed it the next day I just didn't get to update spells on
test. I forgot that in skeleton form trolls and ogres would lose slam, sorry for
the scare. I'll see if I can think up some other way to give SKs skeleton form.<br>
<br>
Stacking issues: I continue to address these as time permits. We're working on
some changes that will allow me to fix them much easier. More stacking issues
should be resolved in the coming months. High level players should be pleased to
know that I'm 99.99999% certain that Call of Earth and Speed of the Shissar will
no longer conflict after the next patch.<br>
<br>
New Translocates: as many of you know there are new translocate spells up on
test. I'm not going to comment on these other than to say you can expect that
cool cat Al'Kabor to be out and about researching again.<br>
<br>
Now on to the &quot;Burning issue&quot;. I know the Wizard community has been
*patiently* awaiting the enhancement we have been working on The coding for the
new spell effect has been finished and it is going through extensive internal
testing. It has also been on Test Server for a week, but I doubt you would have
seen it in a parser – cause I'm sneaky like that. Before I go into details on
the new spells there's a few things I'd like to say. Honestly I feel that
wizards are balanced fine from a power standpoint, to that end you will not be
receiving an upgrade to your damage output. Where I do feel wizards need help is
group utility.<br>
<br>
As I'm sure you can understand coming up with a highly desirable utility type
spell for an EverQuest wizard is not an easy task. I've spent countless hours
pondering a solution, I've read countless message board forums and emails
looking at suggestions from you guys. Finally a solution was found! I'm not
naive enough to believe that everyone will be happy about the new enhancement
but this is an idea I've seen tossed around on a number of forums and I think
not only does it fit in well with wizards being the masters of arcane
transportation, I think it will make them very desirable in the 50 to 60 levels
where they seem to be struggling for usefulness.<br>
<br>
The new spells will give wizards the ability to prevent NPCs from gating. There
will be 3 versions of the spells starting at level 51. They will each have a
different resistance type. One of the problems with duration based effects is
stacking and negating the need for multiple characters of the same class. I am
designing these spells with that in mind. If you want to 100% ensure an NPC does
not gate you will need more than one wizard. I understand this may upset some
people but the need for multiple wizards to &quot;Anchor&quot; an NPC won't
really happen until you fight the more epic mobs with higher hit point numbers.
For single group encounters one wizard with these spells should, in most
situations, be enough to get the job done. My plan is to get these spells
implemented and ready to go before the next patch.<br>
<br>
Lastly I would like to send a huge thank you to all the players who have
reported stacking exploits to me through Email, IRC, and ICQ over the past
couple of months. The feedback is greatly appreciated.<br>
<br>
Take care all!<br>

<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I've made a few
posts about the possible future of all the Iksar class quests and if they will
be brought to logical completion, but have never recieved any kind of response.
I thought this would fall under the category of new topics, but i guess not. If
this subject has already been addressed I was wondering if you could repost your
comments about it. I haven't been able to find any info on the matter.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All of the Iksar quests are
technically finished. All the ones that exist can be completed. Only the
Greenmist quest even implies that there is a chance that the quest might be
extended.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That being said, there are plans
to extend some of these quests at some time in the future. I don't know when
that will be.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Just one little
thing I have given some thought to in the past. In a way its modeled after the
change that came to the xp bar. The smaller line down the middle of the xp bar
that represented the percentage of a yellow bubble.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have wondered
for some time if it would be possible to do something similar on the group list.
However in this case the line drawn down the middle of each players health
status bar would represent how much mana that person currently has. Now I know
this would add to the amount of information be sent out to the clients, but I
always thought it would be an interesting addition.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We don't have any plans to
implement something like that. There really is no way that your character would
know that status of your friends' magical energy. You can look at them and get
an idea as to how wounded they are, but knowing their mana isn't something that
we see as part of the game. I know there have been a lot of requests for this
feature and others this it (one that asked for a %M that would report your
percentage mana for macros). But we just don't see that as part of the game.</font>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Quote
- Number 1 sounds like it might be a bug. Pretty rare case, but I'll pass that
on to Ester.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Very nice of you
to finally mention this, as I have personally submitted detailed information
regarding this very case.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">A couple things:</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">1) It is NOT a
rare case. This is an absolute fact, which happens every time a pet owner gets
charmed. I can personally duplicate this to any VI staff in-game as many times
as they wish. GM's have replied to my /bugreport and /petition's saying it is
intentional to force pet owners to camp or zone after getting charmed to regain
the ability to summon / resummon a pet.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">2) I have
personally submitted this very problem to these boards in excess of 5 times. I
have used /bug and /petition in-game over a dozen times submitting this very
problem. So, though I am only one person, VI has heard of this bug many times.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">3) Bug or
intentional, it is NOT fair in &quot;any&quot; circumstance for pet owners to be
stripped of their ability to summon / resummon their pet. If this is a bug,
please fix it promptly. If this is intentional, please seek employment
elsewhere.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">4) The &quot;rogue
pet&quot; fix only removed the ability for players to create a rogue pet without
the intervention of a NPC. A pet which is charmed by a NPC will become a
experience-giving KOS to everybody NPC if the pet owner zones.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I have personally
had my level 54 water pet get charmed by the level 30ish NPC enchanter at the
lake in Qeynos Hills. When I zoned back, there was my old water pet, scowling,
and killing all NPC's that came within range, including the original NPC which
charmed it. Fortunately, the pet gives pretty good experience per kill.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When I said that it sounded like a
rare case, I meant just that. It's probably not that common that you get
charmed. I have no problem believing that it happens every time you DO get
charmed, just that being charmed isn't something that happens every day to a
character.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And I looked it up. The bug has
been in the database since December. So we are aware of it, and have been.
Obviously we haven't been quick to fix the bug, but we are certainly aware of
it.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I commend Verant
for giving this to all the pet classes, and realizing it has little to do with
roleplay, balance, or power but is a nice solution to some gameplay limitations
(i.e., pathing). Just why did it take you so long to reach that decision after
granting it to Mages? This will be a big help to the main pet classes - mages
and necros and is the appropriate level at 44 as at lvl 46 planes and bigger
raids begin for most charaters.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Now if you would
only do something about fear and resists for necro pets it just might provide
the necro with one of their primary weapons in raids/epic encounters.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, this is a case where were
conflicted. There was a feeling that we should try to further distinguish
magicians and their power over their pets, and also the feeling that it would be
a useful tool for any pet caster.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We decided to err (if we were
indeed erring) on the side of caution and give it only to magicians (imagine the
issues if we gave it to everyone first and then decided to make it a magician
only spell…). After letting it stew a while, we've decided to change our
minds.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As for the fear thing… you'll
have to wait a bit and see what or if we do anything with that. The same issue
applies here. But, unlike Summon Companion, there is no clear need for fear
resistance as a matter of a gameplay issue. It is something to consider for a
'class balance' issue, but that issue is two-sided.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Please don't give
this spell to Enchanters..</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Enchanters mess
with the Mind and Enchant lumps of stuff..</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I do not want the
ability to &quot;Summon&quot;. I am distinctly an Enchanter not a generic
&quot;Caster&quot; and dont want to be treated in such a way.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Provide me a
roleplaying reason why Enchanters now have the ability to Summon. Then give me
access to other Summoning abilities.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of all the responses we've
received on this issue, this is the kind that has baffled me the most.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Several enchanters have responded
saying that this spell won't help them and that they don't want it. I suggest
that you will find it useful in some cases. And, well, who in the world would
say no to a new spell? Seems odd to me.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As for your concern that there is
no 'roleplaying' reason to have it, I have the easy answer. Don't buy it if it
doesn't fit your concept of an enchanter.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Does this spell
wipe pets aggro list? If it doesnt i think it should. Would be totally pointless
if a enc summoned his pet back and it just took off after the mob it was on
again.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">There's no need
for that. If the pet has something on its hate list, that something will have
the pet on its hate list, and the spell won't work anyhow.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Not to ruffel any
feathers, but isnt't the reasoning for giving all pet casters the summon pet
spell contrary to the same reason you won't allow other (than necro) pet casters
get voice graft? As you stated with regards to Summon Companion, it's not
balance issue.</font>
<p align="left"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I personal can't
stand playing the straight caster classes, but for those who do, voice graft
I've seen to be used as a nice way for the friendly comedicly inclined players
to pass the time while on their rears. I'd imagine the necromancers out there
wouldnt mind giving Goner someone to chat with who was likewise summoned to to
anothers bidding. I can even see it now: Goner &amp; Jibantik- of course, the
militia wouldnt enjoy their jokes if the casters brought their act to the stage
in freeport!</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is certainly a possibility that
all pet classes could get Voice Graft. There is no compelling gameplay reason
that they shouldn't have it.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But, at the same time there is no
compelling gameplay reason that they should. There was such a reason for Summon
Companion. So I don't foresee a change for Voice Graft, but you never know.</font>
