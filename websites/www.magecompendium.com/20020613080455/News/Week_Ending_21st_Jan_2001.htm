Small Patch<br>
<br>
The EverQuest Team is currently hard at work evaluating, planning, and documenting our project plans for the current year.  As such, we did not plan game updates during this period, forecasted to last a few weeks.<br>
<br>
However, given today's server maintenance being performed by our Operations Team, we were able to include a few small updates.  These include some minor polishing on the Plane of Mischief, as well as the placement of the wizard's Velious teleport spells on merchants.<br>
<br>
Very soon, we'll be back to our continual plans to enhance the game world.  We'll be sure to let you know what we have planned as we can.<br>

Baltimore Fan Faire - Last Chance<br>
<br>
Monday is the registration deadline for the Baltimore Fan Faire! We are almost sold out so hurry and visit
<a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/fanfaire.html" target="_blank"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>http://everquest.station.sony.com/fanfaire/fanfaire.html</b></font></span></a> before you miss your chance to attend this event!<br>
<br>
Patch Day<br>
<br>
The primary focus of today's patch is to implement changes noted in the new Producer's Letter which can be found at
<a href="http://everquest.station.sony.com/news/letter.shtml" target="_blank"><font color="#FFFFFF"><span style="background-color: #000000"><b>http://everquest.station.sony.com/news/letter.shtml</b></span></font></a><br>
<br>
It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you read the Producer's Letter before playing EverQuest.  It contains some unprecedented and exciting enhancements to gameplay.<br>
<br>
In addition to these changes, the following changes have been implemented:<br>
<br>
Bug Fixes<br>
<br>
- Fixed a bug that caused "root" and "snare" type spells to function incorrectly when stacked.  They should now stack properly.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Fixed a bug that negated the "instrument modifier" for bards using Selo's, causing them to run slower than they otherwise would.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Fixed a bug that allowed two or more spells that grant levitation to stack.  Levitation spells should not stack.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The "Track Corpse" spell now works.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Tracked down and eliminated several bugs that were causing a very small percentage of people to crash when zoning or upon entering the game.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Fixed a problem with some Ulthork armor that caused it to disappear on death if the wearer was of extremely low level.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Tserrina's Whip has been fixed.  If you received one prior to today's patch, you will need to trade out your whip with a GM in order to get one that works correctly.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Last week's patch attempted to fix Celestial Elixir, Celestial Healing, and Torpor, so that they would stack another similar spell, unintentionally causing it to stop stacking with standard regeneration spells.  This has been fixed.  The downside to this fix is that these spells will now overwrite the "Call of Bones" series.  As the three former spells are cast to save a character's life, this solution appears to be the most beneficial for all of those involved.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The stronger /lootnodrop options will no longer prompt you for confirmation when looting your own corpse.  It is highly suggested that everyone reset their option to the strongest security available: /lootnodrop ALWAYS (always ask for confirmation).</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Added some code to address an issue reported by a few players, that being that an NPC named "Ragefire" would die and not leave a corpse.  Though we were unable to reproduce this problem in testing, the code we added should function as a catch-all for this problem.  Please be sure to let us know how this goes.<br>
<br>
Changes/Enhancements<br>
<br>
- While not mentioned in the Producer's Letter, the Zone Experience Modifier has also been increased in Guk (guktop), by roughly 12%.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- "Lay on Hands" has been enhanced again to heal more hitpoints.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Overlooked in the last patch message, new spells were made available to Rangers and Paladins in the upper levels.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- "Voice of the Berserker", a beneficial spell, no longer drains mana over the duration of the spell.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The maximum duration of "Strength of Nature" has been increased.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- A new spell for magicians is now available in game.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The "Shield of the Eighth" spell will now last a number of minutes equal to your level.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- You can now use the arrow and enter keys to select characters in the character select screen.  In addition, the last character you chose will be automatically hilighted when entering that screen.  This value is stored in the EQCLIENT.INI file as
&quot;LastCharSel=0-7&quot;</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The ranger's "Trueshot" discipline has had its damage increased after analyzing data from its fix last week.  Prior to the last patch, all bows, while under the discipline, were hitting as if they were 45dmg bows regardless of the delay. Last week's patch fixed it so that damage was based on the damage of the bow.  This weeks patch increases damage bonuses in relation to delay (longer delays yield better damage bonuses).</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- You can now reverse the left and right channels on your speakers using the /reversesound command.  This should be very useful for those who have had to place their speakers backwards due to cable lengths.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Made some improvements to Paw, Mistmoore, and The Hole, to address some concerns brought forth by the players.  Both zones had some problems that would cause them to be exceedingly difficult in some cases.<br>

message boards.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello all,</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since the launch of EverQuest: The
Scars of Velious, the EverQuest Live team has been working on a number of
things, from addressing issues in Velious to adding additional content to other
portions of the world. At this same time, we've been working towards a point
where we can stop tweaking class-based abilities, and declare with confidence
that they are as &quot;balanced&quot; as we can make them.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is a foregone conclusion that
the diversity of EverQuest's population will never let us reach a point where
everyone will be perfectly satisfied with their class's abilities, as nearly
every change we make tends to bother some people while pleasing others. Still,
we are confident that we can reach a point where problems in our current game
systems can be reduced to the point that those left are either negligible in
their impact, or offset inversely by a similar problem affecting gameplay in an
opposite direction. We're nearly there, but following heated debate and the
review of material and opinions sent in by the players, we've decided to make
some exciting and unprecedented changes to a game system that has remained
intact since release: the experience system itself.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">While the EverQuest Message-board
FAQ states that the experience system is not subject to post-production changes,
it also explains that as developers of an ongoing MMORPG in a dynamic world,
there are times that we need to be flexible and address issues as necessary.
Though it has always been our goal to avoid changes to core systems whenever
possible, our additional goal of finalizing class balance takes precedence in
this case.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're going to depart from our
usual method of releasing information by giving everyone some specific
information in regards to how these systems currently work, and how they will
work after the patch. It is very important to us that everyone understands our
goals, and the fact that these changes are helpful to all of the players. We can
only do that by giving you the details necessary for you to draw your own
conclusions.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Zone Experience</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first and perhaps easiest to
explain change that we are making to the experience system is the modification
of what we call the &quot;Zone Experience Multiplier&quot;, or 'ZEM'. Currently,
every creature in game of a given level yields a fixed amount of &quot;Base
Experience&quot; (experience before it is allocated to group members). That base
experience is then multiplied by the ZEM which is set to a value in correlation
with the risk in a particular zone compared with the reward; at least, that is
the goal.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Recently we evaluated many
underutilized dungeons and considered reasons why they might be underutilized.
Some people suggested that proximity of bind locations plays a part, and as such
we are considering adding more binding locations to the game. We of course will
not allow everyone to bind on the doorstep of a dungeon, but these changes
should hopefully reduce the potential run for a melee class. While additional
binding locations probably will not be in the next patch, we did want to discuss
our thoughts on the matter.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Another suggestion, one that
probably has the most merit, is that some dungeons are too risky given
everything concerned. The natural conclusion is that we should increase the
reward in order to offset the added risk. Our contention is that most people
would rather be grouping and fighting their way through a dungeon because it's
more fun, but feel &quot;forced&quot; to sit outdoors and camp zero-risk single
spawns because it is safer and thus more efficient. While that statement might
be true in an ideal world, it usually results in crowding in these popular
outdoor zones (for example, Lake of Ill Omen or Oasis). The crowding in these
zones really results in less efficient progress than one could make in a dungeon
given a good group, but is still SAFE, at least ensuring that one will not have
to tolerate &quot;going backwards&quot;.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We can increase the reward of a
particular dungeon in two fashions: We can either put in good loot, or we can
change the ZEM. The problem with increasing the quality or quantity of loot is
that if the loot is good enough, it's more likely to draw people far above the
desired level range for the dungeon, making it some place that appropriately
leveled folk choose to avoid. The second problem with the ever-increasing
quality of loot is inflation: as good loot becomes more widely available, its
value and the prestige value from owning it declines.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In this case, we decided that the
most appropriate action for several underutilized dungeons would be to increase
the ZEM; that is, increase the amount of experience that everyone gets when
adventuring in the zone.</font>

receive additional experience (per kill) in the following zones:</font>

The Hole increased by 25%</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Grouping Bonus</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've always been the first to say
that EverQuest is designed to promote grouping. Those who prefer to solo should
be able to do so with some restrictions, but probably will not be able to go
everywhere and do everything like a well-oiled, or like multiple well-oiled
groups. This is a main foundation of EverQuest, and is what drove our decision
to implement a class-based system where classes have strengths and weaknesses
that complement each other.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Aside from making it so that the
best gear requires groups, either to get quest items or get the best gear
directly, our goal was to make it so that groups could advance faster than a
solo player. One way we tried to reach this goal was by putting experience
bonuses in dungeons, so our changes mentioned above should certainly help in
that area. Another way we tried to reach that goal was by giving a per-kill
experience bonus based on the size of the group.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One thing that has been confirmed
by many of our high level players, both inside and outside the company, is that
the &quot;best&quot;&nbsp; groups can already advance faster in a grouping
situation than by any one member camping a single spawn. However, it has been
pointed out that not everyone has the opportunity to get in the &quot;best
group&quot;. This led to many players choosing to &quot;camp the single
spawn&quot; because they then do not have to worry about someone else getting
their character killed. This in turn exacerbated the problem, as many players
chose to &quot;camp the single spawn&quot; from creation to old age, and are
just beginning to experience grouping and learn group-skills at about the time
that dungeons become the most unforgiving. The inevitable result is that the
level 50 &quot;dungeon newbies&quot; contribute to the fact that the group isn't
the &quot;best group&quot;.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our goal is to get people grouping
earlier, and provide them enough of a bonus where they do not feel that they are
losing ground during the learning process. We feel we can do this by doubling
the grouping experience bonus and by scaling it up based on the size of the
group. Currently, the bonus is an additional 2% experience per group member, not
counting the first one, leading to a maximum bonus of 10%. Following the next
patch, the bonus will be as follows:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2 person group - 2% total bonus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3 person group - 6% total bonus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4 person group - 10% total bonus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5 person group - 14% total bonus.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
6 person group - 20% total bonus.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This bonus is applied to the total
experience reward for killing a creature prior to distributing it to the group.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Many people have pointed out that
when killing in a group you get less experience per kill. This is of course
true, but what is often missed is that you can kill many more creatures, and
creatures of a higher level when in that group. For instance, a good two-person
group should be able to kill things of a higher level over twice as fast as a
solo person should. Now, we're going to give them even more of a bonus for doing
so, AND make it easier for people to find pickup groups on the basis of getting
higher scaled bonus.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Finally, we very well may decide
to revamp and/or readjust NPC populations and/or experience multipliers in the
future in order to ensure that groups adventuring there find them worthwhile.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Experience Penalties - Description</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I think that it would be
appropriate to say that most players are aware that there are different
experience requirements for advancement based upon the race and class you choose
to play. Ogres, for instance, require more experience to level than Halflings,
and Shadowknights require more experience to level than Warriors. As such, an
Ogre Shadowknight requires FAR more experience to level than a Halfling Warrior
does. What some people have discovered is that when in a group, everyone shares
in this penalty. Before getting into our plan, I think that its important to
talk about what our goals were regarding experience penalties and the group
sharing in that penalty.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When EverQuest player characters
were being designed, it was immediately apparent that some races and classes
would be more powerful than others given versatility and other factors. Later,
it came to light that the concept of being &quot;more powerful&quot; began to
break down at the upper levels, given that everyone capped at the same level. We
could not let any one race or class be immensely more powerful than another at
that final point, as it would essentially put parts of the game off limits to
those who chose the less powerful classes. While we did a good job of making
races vary in power, but not so much as to be unbalancing, the same could not be
said for classes. Still, though classes would be roughly equivalent in regard to
the compelling reason to play them through versatility, the experience penalties
were kept.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In regards to the sharing of the
experience penalty, it was apparent in beta, before the penalty was shared, that
those playing characters without an experience penalty leveled faster than those
that did. It was obvious that this would occur, but it was to the extreme that a
group of friends, all playing together, would become separated to the point that
they could no longer group efficiently in the mid to upper-mid levels. So we
chose to distribute experience in the group on the basis of the total experience
of each member rather than the level, in order to keep groups together.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As such, a level 20 Troll SK,
having more experience total than a Human Wizard of the same level, would get
more experience from each kill, while the total experience for the kill was
unchanged. Essentially, the SK would take part of the Wizard's share were
everything distributed equally to begin with.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Experience Penalties - Resolutions</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Over the past week the EverQuest
team has been considering experience penalties in all their forms. We had many
meetings where the issue was hotly debated from both sides. We had to consider
not only the effect on the individual player, but also the effect of any changes
on the game as a whole. Eventually, we nearly unanimously decided the following:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. Race-based penalties are
appropriate. An ogre, for instance, does indeed make a better warrior than a
halfling. It is not so little that the faction and size problems make up for it,
and not so much that it is really unbalancing at upper levels, but enough that
the penalty should apply. Secondly, the penalty is not so severe (compared with
class-based penalties) that it would cause groups to break up on the journey
from one to sixty due to level differences.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Class-based penalties are not
appropriate. Classes are roughly equivalent in power throughout the level
ranges, and the versatility does not make up for that penalty. In fact, the
majority of changes made to classes in the name of balance in the last year were
based on the assumption that, at the high end, each class should still be
roughly as needed and balanced as any other.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. Penalties, in any form, should
not be shared with the group. Players know that no one class is immensely more
powerful/valuable than another, and as such it is not fair to ask them to share
a burden. If classes with penalties were really more powerful or valuable than
the other classes, then it might be right, but that isn't the case here.
Furthermore, sharing of penalties causes people to reject potential group
members on the basis of them &quot;sucking&quot; too much experience.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">4. We're going to fix it.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">5. Class-based experience bonuses
(which warriors and rogues get) are also not appropriate, as they cannot be so
if penalties are not. However, we've decided to leave this as-is, since the
bonus is not so severe as to be unbalancing. Bottom line: we don't feel the
bonus is enough to warrant a fix that could be interpreted as a 'nerf'.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Experience Penalties -
Implementation</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Though people often refer to the
class-based penalties as the &quot;Hybrid Penalty&quot;, most classes have a
penalty. Hybrids just have the largest. A hybrid requires 40% more experience to
level than standard, Monks require 20% more, and Intelligence casters require
10% additional experience.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Unfortunately, we cannot change
the experience tables themselves without running each character (which number in
the tens of millions) through an &quot;Experience Converter&quot; without
existing players changing levels spontaneously. While some might argue that we
should grant free levels to everyone with a penalty, that would not be in the
best interest of gameplay. After all, who would want a paladin with level 40
skills (skills in the player-sense, rather than the character-sense) in your
level 60 group tomorrow? Everyone earns his or her experience under the rules
that exist at the time.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This means that we must address
the penalty differently: basically, for every kill, after all grouping bonuses
and zone bonuses are applied, the experience will be split up according to
level, rather than experience. For those classes that do not have a penalty,
they will then be given that share. Those classes that have a penalty will get
their share, multiplied by their experience penalty. Essentially we are creating
extra experience to give to those with a penalty after everyone else has gotten
their share.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since penalties are always a value
over &quot;1&quot;, this results in the creation of additional experience. And,
since shares are determined by level rather than total experience as before, a
character will get just as much experience for a kill based upon the size and
level of the group, regardless of the class makeup. Finally, everyone in the
group gains experience at a faster rate because we're creating the additional
experience for those with penalties out of thin air, rather than taking it from
other members of the group. That means that after implementation, those without
penalties will get more experience for every kill than they would have if they
ever grouped with a class with a penalty.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now you'll notice that we are
dividing up experience based upon the LEVEL makeup of the group. For instance,
if a level 20 and a level 21 group together, the level 21 will get more
experience per kill. That is however only fair since the level 21 does actually
contribute more value to the group.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There is a problem, however, with
this 'new' formula. Death penalties are currently based off of the level before
your current one. Secondly, everyone suffers the same numeric experience loss on
death as anyone else of their race, regardless of class or class-based
experience penalties. What this means is: if I am a cleric, and you are an SK of
the&nbsp; same level and race, we both die and lose the same numeric value of
experience (Example: 100,000 experience points). When we go back to recover from
death, you as the SK will get your 100,000 points back faster than I will as a
cleric, since all of the experience you get is multiplied by your class-penalty
(1.4). Essentially, I lose and gain experience at 1.0, but you lose at 1.0, and
gain at 1.4.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is a balance issue we decided
was also necessary to address. If we are going to make the statement that class
experience penalties should not exist, we then have to do it on both ends (with
exception to the two classes that we've decided to leave as-is). As such, rather
than losing the same numeric value, loss on death will ALSO be multiplied by the
experience penalty. Since everyone currently loses experience as if they are a
warrior of their own race, we do not want anyone to lose more relative
experience (e.g. experience such that recovery from death is more difficult).
Hence, we further multiply the experience loss on death by the class experience
modifier for warriors (0.9).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In our example above, my cleric
would lose 90,000 XP on death at my level (Same as before since clerics do not
have an XP penalty), but your SK will lose 126,000 XP (Same as before, plus
something to offset the experience gain bonus). Death is, however, still easier
to recover from for both classes since we create experience out of thin air for
every kill.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We felt that it was important to
announce this as well since those with penalties will see a larger portion of
their &quot;bubble&quot; lost upon a death, but will now recover that experience
much faster. It's VERY important to understand this. Again, if you play a class
that gets a bonus now when you make a kill, you will also lose more due to
death. Please remember this when, after your first death post-patch, you see a
greater experience loss on your screen: you are ALSO gaining more experience for
each kill.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Summary</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The changes that we are making in
the next patch should have a profound impact upon the game:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Classes no longer have a true
class-based experience penalty, making it easier for people to play the class
that they want to play, rather than the class that they feel compelled to play
due to faster advancement.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Race based penalties are no longer
shared with the group, and in truth are not severe enough to greatly impact the
advancement speed of any particular race. Even the race with the worst penalty
will level no slower than a human monk does now, and in truth will level faster
due to the other changes that went in.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The grouping bonus increase, in
addition to the other changes, makes grouping much more efficient, without
reducing the current efficiency of soloing for those who prefer that route.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Experience modifiers turned up in
the other zones should encourage people to spread out, have more fun, and allow
those staying behind in other areas to have more fun themselves since the area
is less crowded.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All players, assuming that they
have an experience penalty, or ever group with anyone who does, will level
faster.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Many of these changes are quite
involved in regards to their implementation, and as such we want to be sure that
everyone interested understands them. Alan &quot;Absor&quot; VanCouvering will
be happy to answer any questions that you&nbsp; may have on the EverQuest
Message boards. Until then, we sincerely hope that these changes will help all
players, whether &quot;uber&quot; or &quot;causal&quot;, experience and enjoy
EverQuest to their greatest potential.</font>
