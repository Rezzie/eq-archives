Our new Tutorial is Live and ready to teach them to play.  Creating a new character will give you the option to go through the new tutorial.  You can choose to leave the tutorial at anytime and can return until your character reaches level 5.  The tutorial will walk you through gameplay with easy to follow instructions in text and voice.      <br>- Hybrids will now receive mana at level 1 as they now receive a spell in the tutorial.<br><br>CS Assist<br>-------------------<br>A new CS tool is available for use and should provide you with a better interface when petitioning. You can also access our self help option through the knowledge base.  You can bring up the new window by pressing the &#39;P&#39; key, typing /petition, or clicking the "Customer Service" button from the help window.<br><br>Cabalis Quests<br>-------------------<br>Iksar Warriors and Necromancers have some quests to finish&#33;<br>Iksar Beastlords have a new quest.<br><br><br>UI Changes<br>-------------------<br>- There&#39;s a new button in the Options->Display tab to toggle between full screen and windowed mode.<br>- Presto Change-O&#33;  There&#39;s a new button on the bazaar window to hide all traders.

We wouldn&#39;t want all those Halflings to drown, now would we? <br>- Rogues should be able to more easily exit water while sneaking, although I think it would be hard to sneak with wet trousers. <br><br>Misc.<br>-------------------<br>- You now have the ability to "AutoBank" in the Bank Window.<br>- Casting a spell while sitting will stand you up.<br>- Camping while standing will sit you down automatically.<br>- NPC&#39;s will not begin regenerating immediately if fleeing or combat ends. <br>- Improved the Iqthinxa Karnkvi event in Qvic</font><br><br></td>

Knights in particular should find it easier to tank the NPCs they previously had difficulty with.<br>- Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order to complete the Ikkinz trials. Only one person needs to complete all events/raids to start the seventh Ikkinz trial. At that point, all players who complete the seventh trial will get full credit for the zone.<br>- NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably.<br>- Zone travel has been made easier. Animal aggression was lowered by changing their faction and See Invis percentages were reduced on several NPCs.<br>- Spell drops have been increased.<br>- Increased the rate of cash drops.<br>- The mini bosses in Qvic now have a more appropriate respawn rate.  Their item drop rate has been increased to compensate for this.<br>- Breakdown in Communication quest now has improved rewards&#33;<br><br>Collision<br>-------------------<br>More improvements to the collision system should make it a lot more difficult to get stuck.<br><br>Misc.<br>-------------------<br>The Eye of Zomm will once again open closed doors.</font><br><br></td>

Please remember to read the naming policy as listed on EQlive.station.sony.com as it applies to both first names and surnames.  You will still need to ask for CS assistance if you wish to have a name with double capitals or special characters.  Please note that this command can only be used to remove or change your surname once per week.<br><br>HP Regen<br>---------------------<br>- All characters should now regenerate HP faster when sitting.  The longer you sit, the faster you regenerate&#33; <br>- You will not receive increased regen while under the effects of a DOT or while feigned.<br>- You can now bandage yourself up to 70% of your HP. Folks with the appropriate AA abilities can bandage above 70%.<br>- You can now bandage while sitting.<br><br>/rewind<br>----------------------<br>/rewind is back and should help if you find yourself stuck.  This is not an automatic rewind, you will have to execute the command.  We are continuing to work on other collision issues and hope to no longer need /rewind in the near future. This command is only able to be used once every 30 seconds, and in order to make use of it, your character will need to be stationary for at least 30 seconds.</font><br><br></td>
