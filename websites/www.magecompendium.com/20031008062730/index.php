<td width="100%"><font size="2">*** Lost Dungeons of Norrath Launches&#33; ***<br><br>Make sure to check out this groundbreaking new expansion&#33;  EVERY new zone has something fun and rewarding just waiting for everyone levels 20-65, and there&#39;s always something available for you&#33;<br><br>For the first time in EverQuest you have the ability to interact with your environment in new and exciting ways&#33;  Find that chest at the end of the dungeon, but approach it carefully - It may be trapped. <br><br>In addition, there have been rumors of a new type of treasure that allow you to improve your existing equipment, augmenting what you&#39;ve already earned with new power...<br><br>Succeed and be rewarded as YOU choose&#33;  Those who best the Lost Dungeons will find that the Adventurers have quite the cache of treasure that they&#39;ve discovered on their own.  It seems that, the more you help them in their cause, the more they&#39;re willing to share...<br><br>If you have purchased Lost Dungeons, thank you and welcome&#33; <br><br>If you haven&#39;t -- What are you waiting for?   Order now and join the grand Adventure&#33;<br><br><br>*** Game Updates ***<br><br>** Items **<br><br>- Warrior and Magician epic changes – A new version of these two epic items is available to accommodate the new item augmentations.  Both of these epics are basically summoned items, and therefore they would lose any augmentations when used or unsummoned.  Players wishing to change these items into "permanent" versions in order to augment them should do the following:<br><br>Warrior Epic - Talk to Gartrog Smitehammer in East Freeport.  He will replace your Red Scabbard and Jagged Blade of War with augmentable versions of the Jagged Blade of War, the Blade of Strategy, and the Blade of Tactics.  You will not receive the Red Scabbard back, as it will no longer be useful to you.<br><br>Magician Epic - Talk to Ilisiv Gantrau in the Tox Forest.  She will take a summoned Orb of Mastery and replace it with a permanent augmentable orb.  The epic pet is still summoned in exactly the same way, with no changes to the spell or use.<br><br><br>** Zones and Quests **<br><br>- Plane of Mischief - We have updated the factions for a few NPCs for this zone on Stormhammer only.  All of the NPCs there are meant to be aggressive. Some of them were on the wrong faction, and were not aggressive.  They are now.<br><br>- The Deep - There were some NPCs in this zone that could see invisible but were bugged to be non-aggressive.  They will again be aggressive, so be more cautious when using invisibility in The Deep.<br><br>- Plane of Valor - The Aerin&#39;Dar projection was despawning after only a few minutes.  It will now remain as long as other projections.<br><br>- City of Mist - Black Reavers are immune to magic once again.<br><br>- Oxidized Steel Plate will now drop.  This should allow the completion of the Rallican’s Bracer quest<br><br>- The Ghost of Kindle has returned.<br><br>- Manastone is no longer usable in The Hole.<br><br>- The trader limit increase mentioned in the last update should be working properly now.<br><br><br>** Spells **<br><br>- We have reduced the cost of the Summon Wooden, Stone and Iron Bracelet spells. <br><br>- We have added new Skeleton models for pets, illusions, and transformation spells.<br><br>- We have changed the underlying way that pet focus items work to allow for future upgrades and items.  All existing foci should work as they always have.  If you notice anything unusual when using a pet focus, please /bug report the issue.<br><br><br>** Interface **<br><br>- Context Tips - We have added a question mark symbol to windows that have help information available.  Just click on the question mark in the upper right of the window to see the tips.<br><br><br>** Miscellaneous **<br><br>- Fixed a bug that was causing NPCs to appear to have a larger melee range than they should have in some cases.<br><br>- Sullon Zek - There was a bug that allowed players to create characters on opposing alliances.  That is no longer possible.  If you see this message: <br><br>"You currently have characters created on opposing deity alliances. You can only have characters that are on the same alliance.  Please correct this by deleting the character that was recently created and has an opposing alliance with the first character you created." <br><br>You will not be able to log in until you delete any characters that are not on the same alliance.<br><br><br>** UI Files **<br><br>* Changed *<br><br>SIDL.xml<br>EQUI_Templates.xml<br>EQUI_Animations.xml<br>EQUI.xml<br>dragitem27.tga<br>window_pieces01.tga<br><br>* New *<br><br>EQUI_AdventureRequestWnd.xml<br>EQUI_AdventureMerchantWnd.xml<br>EQUI_AdventureLeaderboardWnd.xml<br>EQUI_AdventureStatsWnd.xml<br><br><br>** Known Issues **<br> <br>This is the list of cosmetic issues that we&#39;re aware aren&#39;t perfect, but determined as acceptable to launch with, as none should affect peoples&#39; ability to enjoy the game.  <br> <br>Rather than attempt last-minute changes that often break more than they fix, these will be addressed in an update after Lost Dungeons&#39; launch.<br> <br>- Paladins and Shadowknights:  The new INSPECT and OPEN ability buttons will *appear* disabled for the duration of your Harm Touch or Lay Hands timers when you use those abilities.  You may still use INSPECT and OPEN, however.  It just won&#39;t look like you can.<br> <br>- When receiving an adventure from one of the Wayfarers&#39; Camps, for now, the Adventure Window does not automatically close when you walk away from the Adventure Recruiter as it should.  <br> <br>- Pet Users:  If you tell your pet to attack an interactive object (chest, vase, coffin, etc) inside of a dungeon, your pet will tell you that it is attacking, but it will not actually attack.  This is a problem with the message, not the behavior.  The pet should be telling you that it cannot attack such a thing.<br><br><br><br>** Use Augmentations Wisely **<br><br>If you have an item with more than one slot available and you intend to apply an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot (i.e. Type 1), be sure to apply it last.<br><br>For example, you have an item with three slots available and you have filled Slot 1 with an Augmentation Item.  In your bag you have an Augmentation Item that can fit into any slot on the item (i.e. Type 1) and one that fits into Slot 2.  If you use the Type 1 Augmentation Item first, it will fill the first open slot on your item, which would be Slot 2 in this case.  This means you will not be able to use the Slot 2-specific Augmentation Item you had available. <br><br>So, remember, the rule is that if you have an Augmentation Item that can be used it any slot, be sure to apply it last&#33;</font><br><br></td>

<td width="100%"><font size="2">Today’s patch <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/09/01/wveg01.xml" target="_top">sounded promising</a> but the end result tastes like it has been blown into by an Italian oboe player.  (Tenenous, I know.  You try and think of patch references that Moorgard hasn&#39;t already murdered.)<br><br>The most important features we were promised for today have been delayed by "internal data restructuring", whatever that means, so we&#39;re left with a raftlet of minor changes.<br><br>Magicians can now summon <a href="http://lucy.fnord.net/spelllist.html?searchtext=burning+affliction" target="_top">Burning Affliction</a> focus items for our DoT casting friends.  And now we have a reason to whip out our uniquely functionless Velious DoTs&#33;  For a joke. <br><br>Our summoned ammunition containers now come completely rather than half full (Saving The World 60 Mana At A Time).  I just hope the ammo itself stacks on the cursor when summoned for easy dropping rather than coming in the bag as the patch message seems to imply.<br><br>Once again, we&#39;re just behind some barbarian no one cares about, this time to Solusek C (or perhaps Solusek The Third).  I have 50pp on there being a Crushbone B by the end of the year.  There are also some changes that will interest string-wearing, button-lacking ogre enchanters who fletch, but I lost interest when a skim reading revealed that my favourite exploits haven&#39;t been nerfed.<br><br>The biggest news of today is what we didn&#39;t get.  Absent is the scam-busting (not to mention immersion-killing and customer service budget-reducing) shared platinum slot, as is the fantastically promising pet melee filter.  Hopefully Verant is using this extra time to add a filter that shows pet spell damage and ensuring that pet melee damage is shown zone wide - having to stand under a mob to see how hard your pet is hitting it would be ridiculous.<br><br>Verant should also add a filter for pet command responses (I beg forgiveness master&#33;) or add a toggle that puts all of them in tells.  Currently pet messages are divided across tells (of two colours) and say.  Of course, the vital commands that keep a raid safe (/pet hold, /pet back off, /pet get lost) all produce annoying messages in say which are bizarrely filtered as "Other" along with all NPC text.<br><br><a href="http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=6566" target="_top">Discuss</a><br><br><br><b>August 6, 2003<br>------------------------------</b><br><br>Note:  Some internal data restructuring created a delay in the introduction of the new platinum slot in the shared bank and the new text filters.  We will bring those to the Live servers as soon as we can.<br><br><br><b>** New Adventure in Lavastorm&#33; **</b><br><br>In the depths of the Lavastorm Mountains there is only one ruler.  But even his burning breath and power have their limits.  Rumor has it that there is wealth and danger in locations even further below the boiling lands than Lord Nagafen can reach.  These tales have been spreading like ripples on a calm lake, and their point of origin appears to be an upstart barbarian named Morden.  Some say that he&#39;s already delved these fabled caverns and taken what there was of value.  Other say that he couldn&#39;t have carried it all off by himself.  But most say that he&#39;s a rogue, a teller of tales, and not to be trusted.  Will you discover the truth and brave the heat, or will you sit beside your cozy campfire and listen to stories?<br><br>This new adventure zone will only be around for a while, so you may want to visit soon.<br><br><br><b>** Spells **</b><br><br>- Summoned Burning Affliction focus items added - Mages have four new spells, Summon Wooden Bracelet, Summon Stone Bracelet, Summon Iron Bracelet, and Summon Steel Bracelet.  The bracelets summoned provide the Burning Affliction effect for DoT spells.<br><br>- Summoned container spells updated - The Quiver of Marr, Bandoleer of Luclin and the Pouch of Quellious now appear filled with the appropriate item (for example, the Quiver of Marr now appears with six stacks of arrows).  Also, these items should all be exactly the same, so the quiver function should work properly.<br><br>- Mass Enchant spells corrected - The mass enchant spells for Adamantite, Brellium, Mithril and Steel now create the 5 enchanted blocks that they should.<br><br>- Illusion: Guktan is available - This is an illusion spell for the new Froglok models.<br><br>- Illusion: Scaled Wolf is available - This is an illusion spell for the Scaled Wolf seen in Kunark.<br><br>- Tiny Companion - The spell scroll for this spell is no longer No Drop.<br><br>- Dooming Darkness no longer overwrites Cascading Darkness.<br><br><br><b>** Items **</b><br><br>- Moss Covered Hood - This item can now be equipped by all classes.<br><br>- Silk String - This item is now stackable.<br><br><br><b>** Trade Skills **</b><br><br>- New Fletching recipes added - We&#39;ve added several new Karana-only fletching recipes to help round out that skill.<br><br><br><b>** Quests and Zones **</b><br><br>- Halls of Betrayal - Corrected an error with some of the quest item drops in this zone.<br><br>- Plane of Time - The events in Plane of Time B now remember the progress your raid has made through the zone when you leave and will restore you to the same state when you return.<br><br>- Kagazz will respond when you ask him about fasteners.<br><br>- Experience in city zones updated - Some time around the release of Planes of Power we reduced the experience gain in some city zones.  Tthe experience gained from quests in those zone has been increased.<br><br>- Ogre newbie quests - Added a weapon quest for young ogres.<br><br>- Iksar Necromancer Spell Vendors - The Iksar necromancer spell vendors have moved and are a lot closer to the necromancer guild.  This should make it easier for new necromancers to find these vendors and will hopefully boost their sales.<br><br><br><br><b>** Miscellaneous **</b><br><br>- Spell book bug - Corrected a bug that was causing characters to be randomly forced to stand up when in their spell book.<br><br>- Client crash information - If your game crashes on the client side, a dialogue box will come up asking if you&#39;d like to send us the information about the crash.  This information may help us pinpoint problems and make it easier to fix them.  Only information relevant to the crash, your character name, server name and the zone you were in will be sent.<br><br><br><b>** Fan Faire **</b><br><br>Chicago Fan Faire is sneaking up on us&#33; The Chicago event will be held September 26-28th, and the last day to guarantee your spot at the event by pre-registering is September 8th.  To reserve your spot and pre-register, or to simply get more information, please go to www.everquest.com/fanfaire.  See you in Chicago&#33;</font><br><br></td>
