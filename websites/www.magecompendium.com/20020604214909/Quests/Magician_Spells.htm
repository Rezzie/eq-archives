 Hiptal Frizzleboth says 'Bah!! Its not been a good day. Reports from the Outlands are even worse then I was lead to believe. Many would be adventures have turned up missing as of late. One of them was one of my messengers. He was out collecting some of the various new and
<font color="#FFFFFF"> [interesting scrolls]</font> that have been surfacing in the farthest reaches of this land. I fear for his safety and the others searching for the lost travelers. I wish there was more I could do.&nbsp;</font>

 Hiptal Frizzleboth    reaches into his pouch. Well, let's see what I have in here. Ah, yes. The scrolls are definitely worth finding. Possibly even dangerous if they should fall into the wrong hands. But that is why the Collective sent me here. To procure all of the scrolls so that they may be studied at the Library of Mechanamagica. Bah!! But my messenger is missing! I can't fail them. Would you be willing to
<font color="#FFFFFF"> [help locate]</font> some of the scrolls that I am
missing ?&nbsp;</font>

 Hiptal Frizzleboth says 'You would do that for me ? Of course you would, you realize how important my work is here. Your task is quite simple really. I'll part with one of my rare scrolls if you bring me one of the common ones from the surrounding areas. To be more precise, I am looking for the scroll
<font color="#FFFFFF"> Gift of Xev</font> and <font color="#FFFFFF"> Bristlebane's
Bundle</font>. Oh my nephew is going to love these, I can't wait to get my hands on them. I'm also looking for the scroll
<font color="#FFFFFF"> Quiver of Marr</font>, and the scroll <font color="#FFFFFF"> Scars of
Sigil</font>. Bring them back to me as soon as you find one.</font>
