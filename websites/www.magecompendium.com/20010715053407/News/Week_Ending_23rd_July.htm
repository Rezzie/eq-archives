<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Ivern&gt; Abashi: sorry if
you've been asked this already, but when are the new dragons going to go live?
:)<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Ivern: Dragons? What dragons :)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Uglar&gt; Abashi, can we
sue Verant if we get lung cancer from smoking while playing eq?&nbsp; =)<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Uglar: You can sue anyone for anything, whether you get laughed
out of court and whether your attorney gets sanctioned is antoher matter :)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Jalapeno&gt; Abashi: can
something be done so procs (jboots, staff or writhing's chaotic feedback)
doesn't falsely recharge the harvest icon before the 10 min recharge?<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Jalapeno: I wasn't aware that anything of that nature was
happening?How's it done? ~<br>
<br>
&lt;Jalapeno&gt; Abashi: it doesn't let you recast harvest, just the icon
ungreys after a proc, makes it hard to know when you can use it unless you have
clocked how long ago you cast harvest<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; So after 10 minutes you can still cast it but the icon is grayed?<br>
<br>
&lt;Jalapeno&gt; icon ungreys<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Oh, ok, I'll mention that one...</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Uglar&gt; &lt;tada&gt;
Another question... Why do the other class specific armor/item quests in sol
temple give exp, but the cleric quests do not?<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; tada: In some cases we removed the expernece on a quest in order
to keep epople who weren't of that class from farming the items and depriving
them from the class they were meant for.I'm not sure whether that happened with
those quests or not, I'll check into it</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;jason`cmu&gt; Have they
even looked into the decay time of uber-bosses, ie Dracolich, defeated him, came
back, got mobed by an assling, corpse decayed in 5 mins with a no drop warrior
sword.<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Jason'cmu: We elected not to extend the decay times.&nbsp; /roll
faster :)&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Loki--&gt; got a lot of
questions about cleric armor<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Loki: I don't want to talk about cleric armor :)&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&lt;Loki--&gt; hehe<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Er, I should say that I don't know it well enough to speak about
specific pieces.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Baelish&gt; Abashi Any ETA
yet on ficing the mez stackig and slow stacking bugs?<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Baelish: Not yet, I've been wanting to bring it up again but
we've had a lot of other things that have been going on lately.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;frash&gt; *dav_d* will the
/assist a_mob00 to know if the mob is up in zone will be fixed someday?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; dav_d: Strangely enough, I believe that it was fixed this patch.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Crus&gt; Abashi, got a
question for ya... You said People would lose just as much exp in 45 as 46...
Well.. In 45, I died and lost 1/4th a bubble of exp.. Then later on I dinged to
46, and died pretty much immediately, I then lost 3/4ths out of 45<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Crus: The original information that I released about XP loss was
incorrect.&nbsp; I finally got it all sorted out a few months ago, but haven't
gone out of my way to address those threads yet.<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Crus: Experience loss is based on the total experience needed by
a human warrior to complete the PREVIOUS level.&nbsp; So, you lose less
(relative to level) in 30, and more in 31.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;`Davey&gt; Abashi, I have a
problem, If you can reply to this question that would be great, Yesterday Night
I was cleared 1/2 of fear, Then all of the sudden, our repops in front of us,
and killed us all, I may say, That was a zone repop, but the GM did not warn us,
we all Petitioned, and got no answer, a GM was going anon alot, Thank god after
the patch the plane was empty, so I had a chance to get my corpse, just
wondering can that happen?err, CT repopped I meant.<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; `Davey: Seems to me that I saw a post on Flameplay about that
today, didn't I?&nbsp; Sometimes zones are repopped spontaneously by the system.&nbsp;
If that happens, first, everything will disappear, then over about 1 minute the
zone will competely fill back up<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; `davey: Did pets in yoru group *poof* as well?<br>
<br>
&lt;`Davey&gt; Yes<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; `davey: That must have been what happened.&nbsp; It can be a
pain, espicially in the planes.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;DaScott&gt; Abashi: are you
aware that the three best damage dealing weapons in the game are the barbed
whip, moss covered twig, and moss covered branch in frontier mountains on level
30 mobs? Because of the main-hand damage bonus, these weapons outdamage ALL
weapons in the game<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; DaScott: A new game designer went a little nuts with those items,
forgot the min-damage calculation. They actually won't drop any more.&nbsp;
We're considering leaving the existing ones as-is.<br>
<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; Abashi: and someone caught this, nerfed it to 4/12 (which by the
way is still better than anything in higher level dungeons) and it was changed
BACK? Simple solution: remove branch, make others offhand only, or just
grandfather them<br>
<br>
&lt;DaScott&gt; Abashi: heh thanks for confirmation<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; DaScott: Well, the nerf/unnerf was a different sittuation, but
the solution you mention is simple, of course you know how much grief we take
for 'always nerfing'</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;discore&gt; Abashi: (i hope
its my turn!hehe) have you fixed failed binds? i havent tested lately, but 3
weeks ago i could make a bind fail.<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Discore: I dont' think that they've been able to reproduce that
one on test yet, but cant' say for sure.&nbsp; Stop by the QA board and tell
Ester.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Uglar&gt; &lt;PlzRolbak&gt;
hi. one of the things that was said to be done in the patch was that the
spellbook icons and gems were to updated. all i knoticed is one of my dd spells
got an evocation icon (red hand) insted of the tornado icon it used to have. is
more planned to be done?<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; PlzRolbak: Some of them were really messed up.&nbsp; It's also
possible that they all didn't make it in this patch, which is why I didnt' name
spells.&nbsp; There were actually about 70 gem/icon changes</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;frash&gt; Abashi: When are
girl bards gunna dance ? We are the masters of song and dance. ANd girl ones
dont dance. It should be the MEN who dont dance, just like IRL<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Frash: The anims are a pain to put in post-production.&nbsp; We
lost a few when loading in all of the new ones when we put them in.&nbsp; We
hope to pop the missing ones back in sometime in the future.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;FritoLays&gt; Abashi: Can
you nerf magicians so people will stop playing them and the true skillful mages
emerge to the top again to replace the powerleveling skill-lacking ones?<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Frito: Er, I think I'll pass on that one :)</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;jason`cmu&gt; Abashi: a
month or so again, there was minor patches pertaining to the music in the game,
such as adding a few zones with music with the plans in the future of updating
all the zones, i havn't seen anymore patches of this nature.&nbsp; Have those
plans been scraped?&nbsp; Also, is there any future plans to add more music to
the game?&nbsp; Maybe some talented music players can create some music for the
kunark zones finally<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Jason: They are on hold pending release of the new sound engine.&nbsp;
That should be in a few weeks, then we can start looking at more sounds again.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;frash&gt; *daxdon* can you
ask him how he and the live team feel about mage pets post 50 and if there are
any plans or changes inthe mix for them?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Daxdon: No plans at present to revisit those pets.&nbsp; They
might not be much stronger on a linear basis compared to the level 49 ones, but
pets overall are already stronger than we would like.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Uglar&gt; Abashi:&nbsp; You
said before the patch/dev team was working on a plan of action, any updates as
to what they have come up with yet?<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Uglar: Nope, not yet, sorry :(</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Baelish&gt; &lt;Zumar-Eci&gt;
can you ask this question please.... I have been camping emperor chottal for
about a month off and on whenever a rogue is avaliable to try to get my 59 necro
pet, but most of the time it only drops 60 spells, is this how it should be?<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Zumar: I'd consider trying a different zone.&nbsp; Not every
spell drops in every zone, you might have to hunt around a bit.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;frash&gt; *Nikster* can you
relay ... are there still known problems with the sound blaster live cards and
everquest? i have the updated drivers... yet i tend to get a blue screen once a
night stating an EAX error?<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Nikster: Some players report problems, the new sound engine
should fix up the problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Hidaglio&gt; Abashi:
Xerxes-Veeshan: Why does the lvl 56 necro pet have a higher max hit than the lvl
59 pet<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Xerxes: SpectreLifetap and SpectreStun?<br>
<br>
&lt;frash&gt; *Viron_X* Hey, I got a question for Abashi, if you dont mind...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When a group member loggs or gets dced you cant kick them or disban the group
and your group has to logg out. This is very annoying, will it be fixed ever?<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Viron: We're going to fix those group bugs.&nbsp; One of them
went in today (DC while zoning hosing the group), the rest are probab ly going
ot be int eh next patch.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Hidaglio&gt; Abashi: When
you added the new 'High Level' rogue poisons, are you talking better DD/DOT or
less resistant poisons for fighting bigger creatures?<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Hidaglio: About 10 new poisons, which require more skill and do
more damage.&nbsp; I believe that the top DOt does over 700 damage.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;frash&gt; *Ranador* Abashi:
was the ranger damage bug relatively minor in the sense we wont notice a
difference ? and is defenseive ability being discussed as was said by JB and
Brad at the gatherin in Vegas<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Ranador: It's not that big of a difference, since ranger damage
tables were already close to the warriors.&nbsp; As for the defense issue that
have been brought up, we're still considering everything.&nbsp; We can only make
one change at a time and let it sink in in order to get an idea what is *really*
going on.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;frash&gt; *[FruxX]*
Question: Will enchanters ever be able to cast enthrall/mez over AE mez without
it 'not taking hold', or will we always have to wait for ae mez to break first?&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Fruxx: It's still on the list, sorry about the stacking problem
with mez and the 'insects' line.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Hidaglio&gt; Abashi:
Fiae-Veeshan: Thank you, are resists lowered on higher damage poison?<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Hidaglio: No change to resist rates were made.&nbsp; It all
depends on your levle versus the level of the creature, and it's poison resist.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;frash&gt; p*Drazen* When
there is a moment, can you ask if there will be a fix put in that allows LD
people to be healed? Nuthin worse then watching your Groupmate die while LD
cause you cant heal em.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Drazen: No, we disallowed it purposely due to some exploits that
were available when linkdead, and some current advantages in game for being
linkdead.&nbsp; Basically we don't want linkdeath to ever be a desirable
condition.<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Drazen: No, we disallowed it purposely due to some exploits that

condition.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;frash&gt; *YukiTaro* I'd
like to hear on why so many items are removed from the game, ie : Gem Encrusted
Ring, Rod of Mourning, Idol of the Thorned and now the moss covered weapons<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; YukiTare: Sometimes they are removed just because they get old,
and there are enough in the world.&nbsp; Ohter times, they are removed because
they are too powerful.&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard practice is to remove the drop and
replace it with something that is balanced, assumign we don't modify the item
itself.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0">&lt;Uglar&gt; &lt;[smeghed]&gt;
can you please ask abashi : what happened to the lev 49 pally spell (rangers/sk
had them in a long time ago)...and to comment on deepwater helm nerf<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Smeghed: The quest dialog is designed, the dialog done, and now
treasure tables and such have to be built.&nbsp; I *hope* it will only be
another week or two.&nbsp; It's a cool spell btw.<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; rofl...<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Just heard something funny<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Anyone here have a howling harpoon?<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; The proc was wicked<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; Someone attached dragonbreath to the weapon<br>
<br>
&lt;Abashi&gt; We'll be nerfing that today btw.</font></p>

good decisions, and ones that came from user feedback, including mine.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><br>
</font><br>
Thanks for the note. This is the first post I've seen where someone noticed that
he resurrection problem had been fixed to the level that was suggested. Not only
do we keep experience from being lost until you agree to the Res, but we also
tell you who's casting it and what they are casting. Both of those were as
suggested.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">BTW, I'm sure Abashi is working on the &quot;say no now,
say yes later&quot; communication issue, but don't beat him up for this, it's a
lot better hfor him to change his position to the right one than to stick with
the wrong position just to avoid changing his position !<br>
</font><br>
I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;say no now, say yes later&quot;, are you
referring to the dragging, or where the resurrection issue wasn't considered a
bug? Our &quot;Vision&quot; must be somewhat flexible due to constant changes
and new content that's put into the game. There's only a relatively small number
of issues that we are absolutely firm on. The others take the form of there
being &quot;no short term plan&quot; to implement a particular item.<br>
<br>
We don't like to tie our hands by completely ruling issues out too often.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" size="2" face="Verdana">Hello all,<br>
<br>
I've noticed a number of threads inquiring into the change to invisibility made
in the patch. I thought I'd consolodate the issue and discuss it here.<br>
<br>
First, I'd like to state that the change does not keep pets from casting
invisibility on themselves, so the magician air pets will still be able to do
their thing.<br>
<br>
Now, the change was made due to the way spells interact on NPCs. Basically, by
going through a series of steps, people were able to make their pets permanently
invisible. On the PvP servers, this created a huge issue where people being
attacked couldn't figure out what was going on. On the &quot;normal&quot;
servers, people were charming creatures, making them permanently invisible, then
releasing them into the zone. I'm sure you are aware of the problems that a few
invisible sand giants can cause.<br>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello all,</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We apologize for this evenings
outage. We've located the problem and the operations team is working to resolve
it now. A problem with the patch was causing inappropriate items to drop across
many servers and zones, and also caused some high end loot to be gotten via the
forage skill.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As a result of this outage, we are
currently repatching. This puts us about 2 to 4 hours before the servers will be
back up.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As part of this repatch, spells
will be redone thus fixing the Jolt spell which had reverted to its old casting
time, and the Howling Harpoon will be fixed as it was procing Dragon Breath.
Furthermore, a bug with haste items, which caused the highest-end ones (from the
Plane of Sky) to be only as good as your average dragon loot. Finally, the bug
that causes you to lose invisibility (even though it appears to still be up)
when someone casts a beneficial spell upon you has been fixed.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Again, I apologize for the outage
and thank you for your understanding.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">And how on earth
did foraging get touched this time around ? Nothing thats listed even refers to
that area of coding ?</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Actually it wasn't touched. The
process of transferring the data is what had a problem. The source data (that on
the Test Server) was fine, but the destination data is what got messed up.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello all,</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Many people have suggested over
the past few months that we should implement a version of the /consent command
to give people the option to drag a corpse (via /corpse) rather than loot it,
due to the amount of item theft that takes place. As you know, we previously
ruled out such an option for various reasons, not the least of which were
technical limitations.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">After considering issue for some
time, and taking into account the customer-service issues created by those who
loot corpses and steal items under the guise of /consent, we've decided that a
change to its operation is warranted. In the next patch, /consent will be
changed to give permission to drag the corpse only, not to loot it. Other people
will not be able to loot your corpse.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Though we realize that some will
miss the ability to /consent in the previous fashion, the proliferation of
NODROP items in game has made asking someone else to loot your corpse a very
infrequent event. Given the ability to do one or the other, consent for loot, or
consent for drag, we believe that most people would prefer the option to
/consent for drag.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We hope that this change will
address everyone's concerns by eliminating the amount of antisocial conduct that
surrounds corpse looting.</font>

Patch Day<br>
<br>
Miscellaneous Changes/Fixes<br>
<br>
- The "Safe Points" have been moved in Field of Bone and Lake of Ill Omen to someplace "safer".</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- You can no longer cast invisibility on any pet.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Foul language issued through /emote will now be handled by the profanity filter.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Corrected a bug that allowed linkdead players to walk through locked doors.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Rangers above level 50 will now do double damage with Archery against non-moving, non-rooted targets.  These restrictions allowed us to enhance archery without creating a new kiting problem.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Corrected a bug that had rangers doing less melee damage than was intended except when fighting an NPC who was also a ranger.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Pets, both PC and NPC, will no longer cast "Gate".</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- A large rat says, "Hit by non-melee for XXX damage", is history.  The new message given probably isn't the source of never-ending humor that the old one was.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Updated pathing information in Innothule Swamp.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Corrected many, many, MANY spelling and grammar errors in the world.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Fixed a large number of spell gems and spellbook icons.  Take care to take a look at your spell lineup to familiarize yourself with the new gems/icons.<br>
<br>
Poison<br>
<br>
- Implemented the high level Rogue poisons (level 51+).</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Increased Rogue "Make Poison" skill cap.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Substantially reduced chance to fail "Apply Poison".</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Rogues will now automatically sit when right-clicking on a poison.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Failure to make a poison will now return the vial.<br>
<br>
General Crafts<br>
<br>
- The Ant's Potion may now be used anywhere.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The small and large reinforced wristband may now be crafted.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The small and medium studded shoulderpads, cloak, and belt may now be crafted.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The medium reinforced mask may now be crafted.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Sealed Poison Vials can now be crafted.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The Thermal Cloak may now be tinkered.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The "This item is trivial..." message in craft skills has been replaced with "You can no longer advance in skill from making this item".&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
- The Elven Paladin Newbie Tunic may now be worn by Half Elf paladins.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The Murky Vial will now properly affect the target instead of the player.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Increased stats on many Plane of Sky items.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- There was evidently more than one "Fine Steel Dagger" running around in the world.  Some of them have been renamed "Serpant's Tooth".</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The effect on the Staff of Undead Legions has been changed to something a bit more useful.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The Deepwater Helm now has a significant casting time.  The function of its spell allowed a mana-free heal even though it was intended to be a buff.<br>
<br>
<br>
/consent<br>
<br>
Some people were spamming others with /consent, causing them to disconnect. As a result, /consent can now only be done once every two seconds.  Should you be harassed via this tool, please use /report.  Also, please take care to avoid accidentally /consenting someone, as it will be two seconds before you can undo it.<br>
<br>
Cazic-Thule and the Feerrott<br>
<br>
There has been a significant change to the factions in the Feerrott and Cazic-Thule.  Take care not to get killed by NPCs that previously left you alone.  The significant upside to this change is that the "Cazic Gate/Portal" can be made much safer in nature for those who work on their faction.<br>
<br>
Regen Effects<br>
<br>
This week we corrected a bug that caused regen-type spells (e.g. Regeneration, Chloroplast, Regrowth, etc.) to overwrite DOT spells.  As a result of this fix, players can no longer accept a regeneration spell while under the effect of a DOT.  However, if the regen spell is already in place, the DOT will stack, but not replace the regen spell.  This will allow users of beneficial DOTs, such as Call of Bones, to continue using their DOT while under the affect of
regen.<br>
<br>
Keyed Dungeons<br>
<br>
The key for Charasis (Howling Stones) is now NODROP per the patch message from a couple of weeks ago.  Furthermore, when your character dies, keys for Charasis, Sebilis, and Veeshan's Peak, will no longer remain with your corpse, but will instead return with your character to its bind point.  We made this change to reduce the difficulty and corpse-loss potential of these zones, and eliminate the need to do the key quests multiple times.<br>
<br>
Barbed Scale Whip<br>
<br>
In the last item patch, this item was changed from its original stats to something inferior, as the game designer was not aware that it was already in-game.  It has been changed back to its original stats.<br>
<br>
Hiding Corpses<br>
<br>
A new command has been implemented in the EverQuest client.  This command (/hidecorpses) allows players to suppress the display of player and NPC corpses on the screen.  This can be very useful once you've entered a zone with a large number of corpes, causing framerate to decay.  It will be particularly useful in the planes.  The command supports the following arguments:<br>
<br>
- ALL: Hides all corpses except yours.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- ALLBUTGROUP: Hides all corpses except yours and those of people in your group.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- NONE: No longer hides corpses.<br>
<br>
For community reasons, this option must be set after entering each zone, and will not affect corpses made after you enter the zone.  You can reset it while in the zone in order to suppress display of corpses made since you originally set it.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Resurrection<br>
<br>
The resurrection confirmation box will now report the name of the person casting the spell as well as what spell they are casting.  Furthermore, experience will not be "removed" from your corpse until you accept the resurrection by choosing YES.  Previously, any resurrection spell, if declined, would cause the experience to be unrecoverable.<br>

We don't have a 49th level summon planned at this time. We could probably
implement one just for the sake of doing so, but it probably wouldn't be

Using emotes on NPCs will work again in the near future (not this patch, but the

PM</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello All,</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'd like to announce some pretty big changes
for the better to our Customer Service:</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">1) We are making a serious revision to our Item
Reimbursement Policy. From this point forward, GM's will reimburse items to
players that have lost them due to bugs. We've added a lot of logging
capabilities, and the policy will be to reimburse the item, and then to verify
in the logs that the item was indeed lost. Please be aware, if we watch people
lying to us (i.e. a person says that they lost their Magic Item, but they really
traded it to someone) we can and WILL ban people on their first offense. We
think it's important that we place trust in people, rather than assuming they
aren't telling the truth. The downside to this is that we will probably have a
lot of people trying to scam us. Be warned - Don't try it.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">2) We're in the process of adding a lot more
GM's. In addition, we're adding more GM's during the 7am - 4pm shift to better
accommodate our International users. We're also adding a fair amount of Night
GM's to assist players off hours.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">3) Our Customer Service phone calls are now
completely handled out of the Verant facility here in San Diego. Before it was
split between this facility and a Customer Service group out of Utah. In
addition, we're adding a lot more phone support staff to better accommodate
players.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">4) We've modified our Internal procedures with
regards to how our GM's treat players. One of the biggest complaints we've seen
is that GM's are rude or short with people. It's important to us that our
Customers are treated with respect and appreciation, so we've been working with
our GM's to try and make sure that players experiences with GM's are positive
ones. In addition, we've been weeding out problem GM's. Please keep in mind,
it's not an easy job being a GM and we do ask that players treat the GM's with
respect as well. From here on out if you feel like a GM is being rude to you,
please email our new Director of Customer Service, George Scotto at <a href="mailto:gscotto@station.sony.com"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>gscotto@station.sony.com</b></font></span></a></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">5) We've added separate GM's for Quests and
Events. Expect to see a lot more from us in the near future.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">6) We've put a new email system in place that
should help ensure quick response.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">7) A different version of the Online Store will
be going up soon. It will be web based and people will be able to order Kunark
from it once it's up.</font></p>

<center><font color="#ffffff" size="2" face="Verdana">----Update----</font></center>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello all,</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One clarification that I need to mention in
regards to the newly announced policies.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The section that states, &quot;We've added a
lot of logging capabilities, and the policy will be to reimburse the item, and
then to verify in the logs that the item was indeed lost.&quot;, infers that
items will be reimbursed prior to investigation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our intention is to handle all claims in a
timely manner. Upon receiving a claim of item loss due to a bug, the GM will
begin the investigation process (checking logs, backups, etc). This usually
takes roughly 30 to 60 minutes to complete. The GM will then immediately take
action and reimburse the item(s) based upon the outcome of the investigation.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Our customers deserve courteous and prompt
service, and we'll do everything in our power to insure that they receive it.</font></p>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Why, when the level bar was raised
from 50 to 60, was the skill bar not raised ? The MOBs are higher level. They
hit harder. Why are skills not improving to match ?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Many skills were raised to varying levels
depending on class. You are correct in your mention of the limit to the max
value. It's actually 252 rather than 255 (we use the two least significant bits
for other things), but for the reasons you mention. The cap doesn't allow us to
directly store larger values as part of the character.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Why do the spell effects on
class specific items usually a spell (or variant) of on the class already has ?
Wouldn't it make more sense for them to get something that they do not have
access to ? I myself am a warrior, so any effect is something that I don't
already have, but for the other classes, is it really a benefit to have a
duplicate of a spell you already have ?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's a benefit when the spell on the item
doesn't use mana. Keep in mind that the spells themselves are already balanced,
and that there's only so many things that a spell can do. When deciding to place
a spell on an item, we have to decide what it is that we want the spell to do.
If there is an existing spell that fills the requirement, the existing spell is
often used. As for giving classes access to spells that they don't already have
access to, we have to be vary careful that we don't create a balance issue in
the process.</font></p>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Blame EQ for Powerguilds, not the
guilds Verant created the powerguilds</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;powerguilds&quot; as mentioned here will
occur in any environment where like-minded players are allowed to join together.
It really doesn't matter who is &quot;blamed&quot; for it happening. There's
really nothing preventing two different guilds from getting together for the
purpose of taking on large projects. Sure, communication is marginally more
difficult, but it's far from being unmanageable.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Unfortunately, Verant has
blackballed option #2. Because they provide no guild alliance code, it is nearly
impossible to associate closely with your allies.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whether it's &quot;powerguilds&quot; or &quot;poweralliances&quot;,
the only difference is the name that happens to be over everyone's head. Either
we end up with everyone belonging to the same guild, or we end up with the same
guilds always in an alliance.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm not sure if a sure fire
&quot;solution&quot; exists, or whether this is even a problem that we should
&quot;solve&quot;. There should be some benefit for being part of a large army
(safety in numbers for one), and a disadvantage for choosing to go-it solo or
small, as the case may be. We of course do not want to see anyone monopolizing
areas with their groups, but if someone cannot make enough friends to take on
some of the larger encounters, is that a problem?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Player interaction is one of the main points of
massively-multiplayer online games. I'm not sure that just rearranging the way
interaction takes place from fewer large guilds to allied smaller guilds will
make much of a difference.</font></p>

the dragons available to ALL which is how it should be.</font>
