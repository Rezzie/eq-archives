when it came out, it added <u>so</u> much to the game and Velious has gone above
and beyond that!</font></span>
<p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I think before
verant makes any more expansions, they should revamp all of
antonica,faydwer,odus and use what they've learned while creating kunark and
velious.</font></span>
  <p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Random drops:
  the way that uber items can drop from any mob in the zone is a great idea,
  eliminates the need for on person or group to camp the same spwn point, this
  way several groups or people can hunt several areas of the zone an all have
  the same chance of obtaining an item. such as items from
  shadow's/golems/skeletons in city of mist, or random items off giants in
  Greater Divide.</font></span></p>
  <p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Faction:
  there should be more strict faction placed on mobs in the rest of norrath much
  like there is in velious, you pretty much have to choose sides, coldain or
  kromrif, as of thus far i cant find a way of raisng one faction without losing
  the other, and that's realistic!</font></span>
  <p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">variety:
  theres soooo much to do in one zone for many level ranges, you can go after
  the uber mob, you can find safe area and pull wandering mobs to you, you can
  attack and raid a cavern or fort, you can search out specific mobs.</font></span>
  <p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">cities vs
  dungeons: velious is the first place that a city can be treated like a dungeon
  depending on your faction. thurgadin is a difficult yet rewarding dungeon for
  those that chose to take the side of the kromrif, and kael drakal is a
  lucrative place to explore if you chose to ally with the coldain! thumbs up
  verant!</font></span>
  <p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">teleporters:
  awesome idea to force players to actually have to hot foot it to the zone and
  retrieve a dragon tooth for that zone in order to ever be able to port or be
  teleported there.</font></span>
  <p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">spells: I
  love the idea that most of the new spells are drop only, you have to explore
  and work to get more powers, not just buy it all from a merchant.</font></span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I think if
Verant applied some of these to the under used zones in antonica, it would make
those places very popular again.</font></span>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">We reserve the right to do just as you've suggested at any time in the
future. With the original game we have to stick to our original system

on the old world. And don't be too surprised if we do… :)</font>

<br>
Patch Day<br>
<br>
Today's patch primarily consists of tuning of Velious zones as well as content
and other additions. In addition, the following changes have been implemented on
the Live servers :<br>
<br>
- High-end items that have a activatable (right-click) healing effect have in
several cases had their casting times increased.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Factions for some of the higher end encounters in Velious have received some
adjustments. Basically, &quot;bad acts&quot; receive more weight than &quot;good
acts&quot;. For instance, if &quot;A&quot; hates &quot;B&quot; and &quot;B&quot;
hates &quot;A&quot;, killing &quot;A&quot; will hurt your faction with
&quot;A&quot; more than it will help your faction with &quot;B&quot;.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The stamina reduction with &quot;Resurrection Effects&quot; has been replaced
by a slight attack-speed debuff.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The Ranger's Trueshot discipline now works correctly. It was previously only
working versus other player characters.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The Shadow Knight's &quot;Unholy Aura&quot; discipline has received an
enhancement. When in use, harmtouch resistances will be checked versus disease
instead of magic. In addition, harmtouch will resist in the same fashion as
lifetap spells, meaning that unless the creature is immune to disease, you
should get full damage most of the time.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The spell attached to the &quot;Fiery Defender&quot; can now be partially
resisted instead of being &quot;all or nothing&quot;. The net result is that the
average damage will be higher.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The Paladin &quot;Holy Forge&quot; discipline will now give paladins triple
the normal chance of scoring a critical hit. Each critical hit has a percent
chance to be scored as a critical blow.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Added parameters to the /camp command (the command that will cause you to camp
out if you are already sitting). &quot;/camp server&quot; will take you back to
the server selection screen. &quot;/camp desktop&quot; will take you out to the
desktop following a successful camp. Despite popular request, &quot;/camp
spawn&quot; will not be implemented.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Walruses now indeed sound like they should.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Added the /chatfontsize [0 to 5] (default is 1) command. This command will
allow players to adjust the size of the font in the chat window.<br>

<br>
First: DO NOT GO TO THIS WEB PAGE (xxxsephiroth.xoasis.comxxx). If you insist on
going to this web page, you'll need to remove the leading and trailing x's, and
then the backdoor from your system. It's made up to look like an official
EverQuest web page, and contains an ActiveX backdoor Trojan horse. If this
infects your system, keystrokes will be sent to an ICQ address.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now,
if you've curiously gone to the address anyway, you should be able to easily
deinfect yourself by deleing EA.HTA from your system (just do a search, it can
be found in your C:\windows\start menu\programs\startup directory) as long as
you do so BEFORE YOU REBOOT.<br>
<br>
If you've done gone and rebooted anyway, you'll need to go the long route to
remove it (see below). In any case, please feel free to send out the alarm.<br>

GM Ozzmar – GM Lithgar<br>
<br>
The Dwarf zones into the dusty atmosphere known as the Arena, grumbling over his
wet clothes he looks up at the green named coordinators “Where ya want me!?”
Water flies off in all directions as he shakes his head wildly, his beard
letting loose the soakend water. “That will be 32pp for entry Dwarf!” the
coordinator shouts over the bustling conversations in the entryway. With a
grinning smile showing a darkened chipped tooth the Dwarf rustles in his packs,
he hands over 30 platinum pieces and 20 gold pieces, which the coordinator
gladly accepts. “To your left dorf!, follow the wall until you see your kind,
ye know, Gnomes, Halflings, all of you kneebiters!” The dwarf gives a deep
chuckle and taps his sword while leaning towards the Coordinator “anytime ye
fancy a showdown lad, I’ll be there to cut ya!” the dwarf snaps quickly
right before he heads off into the dust.<br>
<br>
Following the wall the stocky dwarf slows his pace, he sees a mass of people
along the huge the blood caked pillar. The stout half sized warrior draws his
sword and keeps a deadened gaze at the onlookers, as eyes meet in hatred.
Locked, intent on foreseeing each other’s moves, the dwarf cautiously passes
the crowd. One heckler shouts at him “Dorf! Joo com ere, mez stik yous now,
mez saves us da trubl ltr har har!” A troll of unordinary size hearing the
ogres’ humor stands up “ yessh wwwee kud see some foooood before the
battle!” The troll uncovers an axe, the blade nearly half its size and bounds
towards the dwarf. A scaled warrior seeing the ensuing battle springs into
action and follows stride along the husky Troll. Upon seeing the danger, the
dwarf throws his packs down and braces his stance as he grips both hands on the
hilt of his weapon. His veins begin to bulge on his muscles as he raises the
sword up into attack position. Unwavering he scowls at the two hideous forms of
intelligence charging at him. But suddenly out of no where, a fire of from the
heavens crashes between the Troll and the dwarf. An unfortunate Iksar, now just
a slab of charred lizard, finds himself making a second attempt in reaching the
arena in time. The dwarf nearly falls over in laughter at the turn of events,
remembering clearly the warnings of the coordinator, “No PvP combat until the
event starts.” The dwarf understood that this would be a troublesome rule
especially in the arena, but in light of what could have just happened, he was
glad the rule has been set. Picking up his packs and giving a gesture all too
familiar to the Troll he bolts off further down the wall, deep wheezing laughter
could be heard fading away from the evil, dark mob.<br>
<br>
The next mob of people was more his size and nature, the dwarf sheaths his sword
back into his packs. Gnomes were chattering to each out other in their fast
paced tongue. Halflings were casually resting along the wall, so calm and
collected they were he noticed. Some halflings were causally combing their foot
hair like they didn’t’ have a care in the world, as if they impending battle
was to never take place. Grimacing, the dwarf never did like the happy folk but
in battle there is something to be said about being able to look a comrade in
the eyes. Soon though he did find his Kaladim brothers religiously drinking some
ale and with an evil grin that would put Bertoxxulus to shame, he joins his
brothers in celebration. “Aye good brothers, pass me some of that fine
spirit!” Wiping his mouth he glances up at his dwarven brothers, “The purse?
How much?” A dwarf with a holy symbol on his chestplate lifts his head with a
smile, “5,000 shinies brother, bettered with my coin and yours.” He pauses
for just a second before saying “ and I fully intent on getting my coin back
and then some.” All the dwarves and even a few halflings drink to that.<br>
A green named coordinator walks up the short team drawing their attention with
her words. “The rules are this!” as she continues with her speech another
cooridinator begins to chant a binding spell on every team member, while taking
note of the name of the bounded person and wishing them good luck. The other
guide continues “ you will be bound to this location outside of the inner
circle, if you fall to misfortune inside the arena you will find yourself where
you are now, You are to stay here until the end of the match. If ye decide to
break this rule and make way into the inner circle you will be promptly killed
and pulled back to your bind point, most importantly though…” the
coordinator pauses and makes sure everyone is paying attention. She continues,
“…Noted. This note will be used against your team and will result in 250pp
being withdrawn from your winning purse and one less person left standing in the
end will not count as standing. Beware gladiators this match could easily end
early even if some of your team still stands if in fact this rule is broken.”
The short warriors and casters nod in agreement all peering at each other in
hopes that none would break this costly rule. The coordinator continues, “Once
word is giving we will make way into the inner circle and you will all follow me
to another pillar much like the one you are now taking shade under. At which
point you will gather and patiently discuss your strategies for the battle. “
She pauses. “YOU ARE NOT to engage anyone before the battle is to begin. If so
you will be removed from the event.” The coordinator then answers a few
questions from some not so bright halflings and in time finally beckons the mob
to follow her into the deadly inner circle of the arena.<br>
<br>
The short team was not the first to enter the arena, at the far wall one could
see a mass of gleaming weapons and all around them magic being casted in
astonishing displays of color. The dwarf was not unnerved by this comical show
the elves were displaying. He was quite certain that the dwarving clerics would
take very good care of him before the match began. The dwarf did respect the
numbers the elven brotherhood held though, when he was finally settled in the
location the guide had brought them, he stared intently on the elves counting
their numbers. He counted 3 or 4 scores of the pointed eared kind from his
vantage point. Comparing the force of his army to theirs he knew the elves had a
few more blades. This prompted another deep chuckle from the dwarf for he also
knew without a doubt that elves were terrible in battle. Feeling confident the
dwarf opens his flask of ale and throws back a gulp, undoing his weapon from his
pack along with a sharpening stone. The dwarf relaxes in savoring the sound of
the stone against the metal and little sparks that it creates. “Warrior
magic…” he mumbles letting his thoughts drift over the prizes the purse will
buy him.<br>
<br>
The short team and the elf team already stationed inside the arena, next comes
in the human team. Their chins held high, they all walk into a chosen spot
between the two teams already preparing for battle. Not much is heard from this
team as they talk amongst themselves. If looked closely you could see the inner
struggles some of the human clans were facing about the two other teams inside
the arena. Fortunately, greed has its way of temporally setting aside
friendships and the human team starts to enchant each other with spells to
improve prowess in battle. The Eurdites form a circle and meditate in unison,
while the barbarians much like the dwarfs sit quietly sharpening their weapons
carefully inspecting the opposition with wry smiles on their battle worn faces.<br>
<br>
The final team entering the arena creates a terrible display of vulgarity,
bringing out the worst in the three other teams. The hated participants make
their way to their chosen starting location. All eyes are on them and they know
it. Taunting back, the evil team composed of the Trolls, Iksars, Ogres and Dark
Elves, answer a barrage of insults with hideous laughter. What was most
astonishing about the evil team was the size of the army they brought together.
5 or more scores of the wretched kind were eagerly awaiting a chance to inflict
pain and suffering on the other teams. This brought much pride to the evil
brethren but on the same token much fear. They all knew that the other teams
would likely stop at nothing in bringing them down. The general air of the arena
among the other 3 teams seemed to silently reinforce this disheartening thought.<br>
<br>
A cooridinator raises his voice to the point that everyone in the arena could
hear. “All teams are in place, no other participants will be allowed, and no
spectators will see this event. The only way to now leave this inner circle is
through Victory or Death!!” this prompts battle screams and mottoes from all 4
of the teams. When the cries calm down the coordinator continues, “The purse
is counted at 7400 platinum pieces to be divided up amongst the winning team. We
will now give you 10 minutes to make final preparations for battle. No PvP will
be tolerated before the announcement is to begin.!!” The coordinator heads
back to his chosen team and watches for infractions of the rules he stated.<br>
<br>
For the next ten minutes, the atmosphere of the arena is of a calm before the
storm. Casters are hurriedly finishing off final buffings to their teammates.
Leaders are planning strategies and organizing teammates into groups.
Coordinators are taking their places at both entrances readying their weapons
for infractions of the rules. A two minutes warning is giving to the zone to
prepare for battle.<br>
<br>
A noble High Elf woman makes her way to the very center of the teams. Equipped
with a flaming sword, Lady Daegarmo asks for a moment of silence in the seconds
before the battle. Welcome to the Test of Teams citizens of Norrath! I wish you
all the best of luck! On my mark…” She pauses for the remaining seconds of
the 10 minute warning.<br>
<br>
At the top of her lungs Lady Daegarmo screams with the power of the Gods,
“FIGHT!!!!!”<br>
