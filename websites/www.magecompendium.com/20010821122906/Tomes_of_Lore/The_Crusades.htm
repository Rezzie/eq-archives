<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This is the time of the scattered and defeated Iksar empire. The great
dragon, Trakanon and his allies of scale have left the empire in rubble and our
people are divided yet again. the once grand city of Sebilis is claimed by the
one who descimated it.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The remaining Iksar are scattered among the outlands of Kunark. Their
places of refuge are now the dwellings of dark denizens. In the wilds, a few
castes come to unite. One of these are the remnants of the Crusaders of
Greenmist. They are lead by a powerful shadowknight named Nok Nilok.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The army of shadowknights number in the hundreds. Within their ranks are a
few mystics and legionnaires. The tribe names itself after their leader, they
are to be named, The Crusaders of Rok Nilok and they shall purge the lands of
Kunark.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Crusaders burn across the Dreadlands and death comes quickly to those
who dare stand in their way. They slay many giants and many goblins. There shall
be no prisoners of slaves. The empire shall be rebuilt by the hands of the Iksar.
All other shall perish.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Karnor's Castle is the first major objective of the Crusaders. It has now
been taken over by goblin clans. The Goblins soon find themselves under siege.
for twenty days they hold ground until the Crusaders choose to assault as a band
of goblin deserters flee. A swift battle ensues and the castle is reclaimed.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Crusaders now set their sights on the city of Cabilis. While the march
is designed, Rok Nilok discovers something very evil. Nothing is known of his
discoveries. No record exists of it's evil. All that is known is that Rok Nilok
made a pact and soon shall suffer for it.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">During the battle for Cabilis, a strange rain falls which shrinks them to
the size of dolls and their heads are set aflame. Nilok's head burns red. And
the goblins squash the would be emperor and his minions.</font></p>
