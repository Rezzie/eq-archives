he's a person'

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You say, 'Al'kabor is a Gnome Wizard, he founded many of the spells we still

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You shrug unknowingly.

messenger that there was
something special in the cargo hold of this ship.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'So, that bright sunny morning Al`kabor went to his storage
chest and gathered his robe, staff, spellbook, and a few other wizard items'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Woodsmoke says, 'is the water in
Odus salty?'

</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Woodsmoke says,
'I have never tasted it'

Janck.'

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'There was only one problem...'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'What was the problem?'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor only heard rumors of where he may now be, so he knew
he would need help finding&nbsp;</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tillerman, for he was the only one who knew exactly
where this wreckage was'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Ah...Woodsmoke that part is yet to come.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'What kind of help could he get to find this
Tillerman?'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor decided that he would find aid in the great city of
Qeynos.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'Qeynos is quite a way away from the OOT.&nbsp; Why did he go
there?'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Alain, he needed to hire help'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Ah...there is more friends'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'What kind of help did he find in
Qeynos?'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Well,'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'When Al`kabor arrived to the great city of Qeynos...rumor has
it the old powerful wizard's&nbsp;voice boomed through the halls of the great stone
city of Qeynos as he called for the help of six brave ones'</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Brave ones...just like many of you'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'And did 6 brave ones respond to his request for help?'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor mentioned that he needed help of at least a ranger
and an enchantress'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Aye...after some time....six brave ones did agree to help
Al`kabor.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'They were not quite sure why, but when Al`kabor calls upon
people, many do try ot aid'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'Did he threaten them?&nbsp; Or the city of
Qeynos?'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor explained that the six brave ones could have
whatever was on this wreckage, except for one item which Al`kabor would not
name, which he badly wanted.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Well Alain, Al`kabor calls upon people as 'minons' to put it
mildly, very to the point he is'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Starky says, 'Ah so he had another motive besides to save
Tillerman'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'continuing...'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Al`kabor did explain that he learned that this Tillerman was
rumored to be somewhere in the&nbsp;Commons.'</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Have you all seen the great Grasslands of the Commons?'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Woodsmoke says, 'AYE'

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'Al'kabor gathered the 6
heroes.'

Common lands.'

</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'To find Tillerman.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Thank you Alain...'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'So, they all set out...just as it began to rain...on the path
to the Common lands'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'They as in the six brave ones, and
Al`kabor'

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Upon arriving at the Commons...'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'The ranger did begin to use his skills in the ways of
tracking.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Anyone here a ranger?'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Starky looks at Rahgoths and raises his hand.
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths beams a smile at Starky.
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Starky can relate then.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths smiles.

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Starky nods at Rahgoths.
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Anyway..'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'Do you know what the Ranger's name was?'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'The ranger did begin to track and find signs of disturbance
of leaves and such'

</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Alain, that part has been lost in the tale...'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'Alas.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'The ranger did indeed lead them to a man...whom was gathering
berries'

</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Upon hailing him and some introduction.....'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'It was indeed Tillerman
Janck'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'The brave ones and Al`kabor explained how they dearly wanted
him to lead them to the&nbsp;wreckage'</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Woodsmoke says, 'Ooooo'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman however made it very clear
he wanted nothing to do
with the Ocean again, as he&nbsp;now feared water, hence his moving&nbsp; the the
Commons'</font>

</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Aye Alain'

</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says,
'Well,...according to my book, but again my book is old.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'Did he know what the cargo about the ship was?'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths smiles.
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'That part will come later Alain'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Well, it did take MANY ales to persuade Tillerman to aid
them'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'but...alas he did cave in and agree to lead them to the
wreckage'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'So, the next day, after some rest'

</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman, Al`kabor, and the six brave ones set out for the
Ocean of Tears'

actually paused to
take a look around and be in&nbsp;Norrath? '</font>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'Sure,
Steamfont is a particularly fascinating place.'

</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Khaled says,
'Always good to go back to the caves of Ak'anon and go for a swim
in that green water'
</font>
</p>

</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Khaled says, 'it keeps my skin soft'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Where were we again?'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You say, 'It was
autumn, leaves were brown....'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'ah yes'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'Tillerman was leading Al'Kabor and the
heroes to the Ocean of Tears.'

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Upon reaching the
shoreline...'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman began to tremble with fear...'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'He began to walk backwards slowly...away from the group and
shore...'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Indeed it was
apparent that panic filled his heart and mind'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Alas the enchanter in the group smiled softly and began to
cast some kind of enchnatment.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Tillerman became calm.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'The enchanter did again cast another spell upon the
party...and Tillerman as well.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'They no longer
felt the need to breathe air like mortals'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Khaled says, 'what shoreline were they at?'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Khaled says, 'sister isle?
freeport?'

'I see.. I see....'

</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'The enchantress began to cast this enchantment upon Al`kabor
as well..'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'but he smiled bitterly soft, calmly
interrupted the
enchantress and taped to his earring.'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'He said &quot;No need, I have my powers with this&quot;'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'Some say such an item exists in this land still....alas I do
not know what it could be'

</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths says, 'It was a hull...or what was left of it....'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Alain says, 'Was it Tillerman's ship?'
</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Rahgoths nods.
