<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><font color="#FFFFFF">Note :</font></b>
I have tried this quest myself and have got as far as I have detailed here.</font></p>

<hr color="#660066" size="20">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This quest starts in <font color="#FFFFFF">Najena</font>
with the <font color="#FFFFFF">Visiting Priestess</font>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"> The Visiting Priestess spawns near
the <font color="#FFFFFF"> Ogre Captain</font>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">If evil, you can hail her and she asks <font color="#FFFFFF"> &quot;Are you the
champion that Najena sent for ?&quot;</font>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You have to say <font color="#FFFFFF"> &quot;I will champion for
Najena.&quot;</font> and she will give you her quest.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She wishes to put together the The
Staff of The Ankexfen.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tell her <font color="#FFFFFF"> &quot;I have not heard of the staff.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Then tell her <font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;What happened to the Ankexfen
?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">She will then reveal that the
staff has been broken into four parts which were given to various goblin tribes.
She wants you to collect these pieces and states that you will be rewarded by
the <font color="#FFFFFF"> Priests of Innoruuk</font> for their return.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These pieces are the four Crystal Staves :</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Ice Crystal Staff : Scryer
in Permafrost</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Water Crystal Staff :
Webclaw Murkwave in Lake Rathe</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Slime Crystal Staff : King
Xorbb in The Gorge of King Xorbb</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">The Fire Crystal Staff : Goblin
Drunkard in Solusek's Eye</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Collect these and pass them to her and in
return you will receive an unreadable note. As you pass her each piece, she grins evilly and
adds it to the staff she is carrying until <font color="#FFFFFF"> she</font> wields the
<font color="#FFFFFF"> Staff of The Ankexfen</font>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Note :</b></font> I do
not know if anyone has killed her when she is wielding the staff to obtain it.
Or even what the staff does.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Once she has all four pieces, a scroll called
the Scroll of <font color="#FFFFFF"> Flayed Goblin Skin</font> will appear in your inventory.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is written in Dark Elf, it says <font color="#FFFFFF">&quot;Some illegible writings about Neriak and
blue flames&quot;</font>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><b>Note :</b></font> Nobody is sure who you give the scroll to.
A priest will spawn in the Temple Steps in Neriak and immediately kill herself, so it
may be that she is the one, but that it is broken. However seeing as the first part
works fine, it is likely that the quest is solvable.</font></p>
