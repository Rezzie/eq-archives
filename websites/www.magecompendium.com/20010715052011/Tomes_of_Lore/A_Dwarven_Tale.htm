<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Where is something interesting....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Hmm.. History is so dull at times.
Perhaps a story my father told me...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena closes her book and puts it away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'There now...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena clears her throat a bit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Where to begin....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Once, a long time ago, when the world was
young, and the gods' presence could still be felt by mere mortals...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'there was a King who ruled over the race
of Dwarves deep in the earth, over the city of Kaladim.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'He was a good king. Strong and powerful,
but also fair and just.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'He had trained with the Paladins as a
young lad, and was well known for his good deeds about the land.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'His name was Darkathan.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'In his youth, Darkathan wandered the
lands far and wide....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'He traveled o'er the Ocean of Tears to
the continent now known as Antonica....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'and spread the word of the Paladins, meting
out justice to the wicked and evil of heart.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'One day, he came upon a group of Dark
Elves in the forests of Nektulos...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'He crept up to them silently, watching
what they were doing....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'The appeared to be sitting around a fire,
discussing some evil plan as their skeleton pets watched the surrounding area,.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Intent on ridding the land of these
heretics, Darkathan crept closer, until he was almost on top of the camp...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Then he heard what they were saying....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;You can't be serious&quot; said
one. &quot;Aye, but I am. The Queen has ordered it!&quot; said another.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;But to cross the Ocean? To the
lands of those peace loving elves and dwarves? But why??&quot; the first asked.'Aileena
says, 'Then he heard what they were<br>
saying....'<br>
<br>
Aileena says, '&quot;The Queen wants us to cause some kind of trouble over there
in Kaladim.&nbsp; She'll give us more information when we go to see her.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Darkathan had heard enough.&nbsp; With a
cry he leapt up and charged at the Necromancers, quickly cutting them down
before they were even able to call to their pets for protection.'<br>
<br>
Aileena says, 'The necromancer's pets, not having a chance to react, crumbled
into piles of dust and bones at the death of their masters.&nbsp; Darkathan took
a moment to survey the scene.'<br>
<br>
Aileena says, '&quot;Bah&quot; he spat. &quot;They must
have been new to the Necromancers to fall that easily.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'He picked through their remains and found
a note....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'It was scribed in a language he didn't
understand, a spidery scrawl that was evil even to look at.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Unsure of what to do next, he wandered
out of the forest, and went to a small village nearby, that would one day become
the city of Freeport.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'He went to the village elder, and asked
him to translate the letter...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;Ah, most curious indeed&quot; said
the Elder. &quot;You have stumbled upon a rather rare find here...&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;This letter contains specific
instructions for a group of Shadowknights to make their way to Kaladim, and
includes a detailed plan of the city.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;With this, they could easily sneak
in and cause whatever mischief they would want before anyone would know about
it!&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Darkathan thought about the issue at
hand, and asked what the best course of action would be.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'The Elder replied &quot;Go back to your
fellows in Kaladim. Warn them of this danger, and work to prevent it. Surely
this is not the only copy of this map around.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Taking the Elder's advice, Darkathan
returned to his city, and showed his fellow Paladins what he had found.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'They then took steps to seal off the
secret entrances, and lay traps to throw off any of the evil ones that might try
to attack.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'A week later, a group of two dozen Dark
Elf shadowknights crept silently through the forests and mountains of
Butcherblock, intent on finding the entrances and carrying out their heinous
tasks....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'But the Paladins were waiting for them,
and a great battle ensued !'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'The light magic of the Paladins was equal
to that of the Shadowknights...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And although the numbers were small, the
battle raged for almost an hour.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Finally, in the end, Darkathan managed to
seriously wound the last of the Shadowknights, a strong and evil warrior who had
taken down many of the Paladins there....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'But the Shadowknight suddenly disappeared,
stepping lightly into the shadows, and disappearing with the night...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'The king at the time awarded Darkathan
for his good deeds, and made him the next in line to take the throne of Kaladim....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'It is several years later that the main
part of this story takes place....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'The king of Kaladim had died, and
Darkathan took over as the ruler of the city.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And far across the see, a Dark Elf... a
shadowknight, with the scars of battle across his chest, slowly fueled his
hatred of the Dwarf....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'This Shadowknight who was almost killed
by Darkathan was named Ty'Vallan....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Even after 15 years he still remembered
the night that he almost died at the hands of that Paladin who now sat upon his
throne and played king of the dwarves.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And one day, he set his revenge into
motion....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'He went to the rogues guild, and learned
some of the art of disguise....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Using these techniques, he once again
made his way across the Ocean of Tears to the mountains of Butcherblock...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'On the day of his arrival on Faydwer, he
saw a pair of young dwarves sparring near the waters...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'As he looked closer, he saw that these
were two Paladins, of the same guild as the King.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'As he stared evilly at the two dwarves, a
final formation of his plan of vengeance manifested in his twisted mind...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'The two dwarves were named Kalgath and
Gathral. They grew up together and were best friends, both joining the Paladins
of Kaladim and training together.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'After a few hours of practice with the
hot sun beating down on them, they decided to take a break.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;I will head back to Kaladim and get
us some fresh water and food while you rest&quot; offered Kalgath.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;Aye, that would be great.&quot; the
Gathral responded.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And so Kalgath made his way back to the
city, as Gathral found some shade under a nearby tree, letting the light ocean
breeze cool his face.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'At this moment, Ty'Vallan decided to
implement his plan...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Donning a guise to make him look like a
human, he walked up to the dwarf, and hailed him.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;Greetings, good Dwarf&quot; he
said.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;Greetings friend&quot; replied
Gathral.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;What might I do for you this fine
day?&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Ty'Vallan smiled to himself, but was
careful not to let it show...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;My name is Merdill. I am a
messenger from the Elder of the small town of Freeport...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;I have a message to give to your
king, but I am afraid I need to get back home as soon as I can... you see, my
wife is with child.... and... &quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Gathral stood up and said &quot;Say no
more friend. Go back, and tend to your family. I will take care of your message
for you.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;My thanks!&quot; responded
Ty'Vallan, sensing his victory near...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;Here, take this note, and this
potion. It is infused with a Spirit of the Wolf, and will speed your journey
back to your King&quot; he told the Paladin.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;My thanks&quot; replied Gathral.
&quot;Now go, I will see that this message is safely delivered directly to King
Darkathan.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'The disguised Dark Elf beamed a smile at
the Dwarf, and waved goodbye, turning as if to walk back to his ship...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'But once he was out of site, he used a
spell to make himself invisible, and crept back towards the Paladin.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Gathral said to himself &quot;I wonder
what can be of such importance. Ah well, I'll not break my word, for my word is
my life!&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And with that, he gulped down the potion,
and began to run towards Kaladim as fast as he could....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Ty'Vallan laughed evilly, knowing the
true nature of the potion the Paladin had just imbibed...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'For it did contain the Spirit of the
Wolf... of this there was no doubt...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'But it also contained an evil spell of
Suggestion....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And before handing it over, Ty'Vallan had
made very sure what suggestion was used with the potion....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And as Gathral ran back to Kaladim a fast
as his magic infused short legs could carry him, one thought ran through his
head.....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;Kill the king!!!!!&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And so he ran, determination spreading
across his face.. to find and kill the King. And after that, it didn't
matter...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Now it so happened that Gathral's friend,
Kalgath, was coming out of the city as Gathral was passing by...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Kalgath, wandering why Gathral was moving
so quickly, and in such an obvious hurry, turned around, dropping his backpack
of supplies, and chased after the Paladin.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'He managed to catch up with him as
Gathral was going through the Guard Checkpoint....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;My friend, &quot; he started...
&quot;Why in such a hurry? I thought we were going to continue to spar until the
evening came?&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Gathral glared at him, and said in a
harsh voice &quot;Back off! I have important business to tend to!&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Kalgath was stunned at this... His friend
had never spoken so harshly to him before....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'He sensed that something was wrong, but
didn't know what...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'So he focused, calling upon his god and
focusing his powers of good....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Stop!!&quot; cried Kalgath!'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'But Gathral paid him no heed...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;Stop! Stop! Go no further!&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'But again Gathral would not listen...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And so Kalgath pulled out his sword, and
put himself in front of the path of Gathral....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;I see that aura around you. You are
possed by evil! What has done this to you my friend?&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'But no answer came from Gathral...
instead, his sword whistled from it's scabbard, straight for the head of Kalgath!'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Kalgath parried the blow, and backed
away...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'But Gathral lunged again, this time
aiming for the heart...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'The fight ensued, Kalgath trying not to
hurt his friend, and Gathral using all in his power to force Kalgath out of his
way...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'All this commotion soon brought forth the
Kaladim Guard....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And they charged in, grabbing both the
Paladins, and restraining them...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'The Guard took their weapons, and lead
them to the King....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;What is the meaning of this?&quot;
asked Darkathan of the two Paladins before him, stripped of their weapons and
held by the Guards.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;I will NOT have fighting in MY
city, especially not between to respected and honorable Paladins!'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Gathral's face lightened, and he bowed
down on one knee...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;Please forgive us, oh great
King.&quot; he said. I meant no offense to you or to these good Guards here. I
was overtaken by a madness. I know not why. If you will grant it of me, I would
ask my weapon back, and leave to visit the Clerics for healing.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Kalgath tried to break in, but the King
stopped him. &quot;Very well&quot; said the King. &quot;Guards, give him his
weapon, and take him to the Clerics Guild.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And so it was done....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'But as soon as the sword was back into
Gathral's hands, he cried out, darkness spreading over his face, and ran
straight at the shocked King!'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Before he could react, Gathral had ran
his sword through the chest of the King...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Screaming in pain and anger, Kalgath
grabbed his sword from the Guard, and charged his friend...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'The fight was short, and in the few
seconds it took, Kalgath ran the sword through his friends stomach, then brought
it down over his head....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And as he died, Gathral's face lightened,
and he whispered &quot;I'm sorry&quot;......'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Kalgath let out a cry so mournful it
echoed down the halls of Kaladim....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;Wait!&quot; shouted a Guard,
leaning over the King... &quot; He is still alive! But faintly...&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Kalgath momentarily shoved his sorrow to
the back of his mind, and bent over the King...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'He focused hard, calling once again on
his god, and put his hands over the gaping wound....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'A sudden burst of light filled the
chamber, and a shiver was sent down the spine of both Kalgath and the King, and
as the light faded, the Guards could see the wound on the King was healed....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Kalgath, exhausted by the strain of using
his Lay on Hands, collapsed, and began to weep over the loss of his friend....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'King Darkathan slowly stood up, and
looked down at his newly healed chest...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Breathing a sigh of relief, he helped
Kalgath to his feet....'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'You saved me, &quot; said the King.
&quot;Whatever can I do to repay you?&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Kalgath looked at the King, his eyes wet
with tears, and his lips trembling...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;My liege&quot; he began...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;My friend is dead. And I do not
even know why?? And I was the one that killed him! Oh what have I done!?&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;Please, my liege, allow me to find
the person who did this... Surely Gathral was under the influence of some dark
magic! Please, let me avenge my friends death! And atone for my sin of killing
him...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'The King looked at him with saddened
eyes, and said &quot;Aye, you may do so. But be careful not to let your anger
take the form of vengeance. Do this to rid evil of the land.. not because you
seek to punish.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'Kalgath nodded at the king. &quot;You are
right, my liege. And I will rid the evil of this land! That will be my
atonement.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'King Darkathan nodded, and led Kalgath
into a side chamber by his shoulder.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'He pulled out a key, and unlocked the
door, revealing the Kaladim Treasury.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;Take whatever you need, my young
friend. Buy your supplies, equip yourself, and start your journey when you see
fit.&quot;'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, '&quot;Aye, I thank you, my liege&quot;
replied Kalgath, bowing before the King.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And so Kalgath took some gold and bought
the necessary supplies. And the King ordered the best Smiths to create special
armor and a sword for him, of the finest dwarven metals...'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'And thus, with a heavy but determined
heart, Kalgath left his home, and started a journey that would take him many
years... '</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena says, 'But that, my friends, is another story.'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana">Aileena smiles.</font></p>
