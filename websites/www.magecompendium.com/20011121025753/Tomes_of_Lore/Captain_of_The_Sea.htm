Irontail : Master of the Sea</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">370 A.G. :</font> Vlzk,
student of the 5th rung, becomes the youngest Iksar monk to attain the title of
Tynn Master. He takes his place among the masters of the Court of Pain.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">371 A.G. :</font> Master
Vlzk becomes the only Iksar monk to be promoted to the rank of Captain within
the Iksar Navy. He is promoted by the great Emperor Rile. This act solidifies
the alliance between the monks and the Legion and ushers in a new age of
disciplines.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">372 A.G. :</font> During
a coastal patrol being conducted by Captain Vlsk, a fierce and sudden water
spout hits and splinters his ship. The Navy searches for survivors and none are
found.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">406 A.G. :</font> During
a Deep Range Patrol, a group of Legionnaires is greeted by Captain Vlsk. He has
survived in the Outlands with no aid. His once proud tail has bee ripped from
his body by a Trakanasaurus. He becomes a hero. The blacksmiths are ordered to
create a tail made of iron. He is now Captain Irontail.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Captain Irontail is promoted to Captain of the
Iron Guard, a roving coastal armada. He is also rewarded with great items of
magic. In his honor, the Baron and the Arch Duke create an awesome weapon called
the Storm Sabre. They also create a lesser blade for all who serve in the
Ironguard--The Tynn Foil.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF">406 A.G. :</font> During
the Infamous Battle of Timorous Deep, Captain Vlsk Irontail is defeated as well
as most of the Sebilisian Navy. A horde of dragons descended upon them. The navy
was vastly outnumbered. So was the end of the great Captain Irontail. Long live
his spirit.</font></p>
