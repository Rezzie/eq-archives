of the recent research done by young Magi has dealt with the piecing together of
old spells.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
Since many of the spell fragments found are not written in common, I have been
asked to write a brief treatment on languages, research and magic.</font></p>

history of magic on Norrath can be divided in to four Eras :</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Verdana" size="2">The
most recent historical period saw the conflict between Dark Elven Necromancy and
the magic of the forefathers to those who now live on Erudin.<br>
<br>
Books from this period are alternately written in Elder Tier’Dal and Old
Erudian.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Verdana" size="2">Proceeding
this conflict was the era of the Combine Empire, whose glory stretched across
the length of Antonica.<br>
<br>
This civilization flourished for a handful of centuries before their magical
powers became so great that the dragons of the world awoke and grew jealous.</font><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Verdana" size="2">
All that remains now of the Combine Empire is steel and ash.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
Scrolls from this period were written in Combine.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Verdana" size="2">Before
the ascent of the Combine Empire was the Age of the Dragons.<br>
<br>
These powerful beasts ruled all of Norrath under an iron claw and spell-quick
voice. Their wizardry was dark and strong.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Verdana" size="2">Magic from this period was recorded in the
Runes of Dragon Tongue.</font></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0" align="left"><font color="#C0C0C0" face="Verdana" size="2">In
the beginning, during the age of scale, were those known to me as the Elder
Dragons. Their language is as harsh as it is difficult, twisted as it is beguiling. The
rewards of learning Elder Dragon are, however, plentiful, as to speak their
tongue is to know the language of magic itself.</font></p>
