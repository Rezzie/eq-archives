Tails of Cabilis</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was in dawning of the Sebilisian Empire that
the art of fist and tail was forged. In the beginning, the pugilists of the
great tribes were nothing more than warriors without weapons. Soon we would be
forged into weapons.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Grandmaster Tynn was the father of our
disciplines. He came to the empire from an unknown tribe. Some say he was a
ronin who wandered the worlds of Norrath where he formed the basis of the city
of Sebilis with no rebirth. He entered to form a caste which did not exist. He
was quickly challenged by the warlords. He spoke his words and they did not
listen. He knew the only way to make them understand was to challenge their
finest in The Gauntlet. He called for four of the finest warlords and allowed
them arms. The warlords agreed, thinking his challenge as easy task.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Grandmaster Tynn quickly dispatched of the
warlords with nothing more than fist and tail. He fought in a way never
displayed. His victory earned him much respect and Emperor Sathir soon commanded
him to form the Court of Pain and raise an army of monks. Tynn formed the
Swifttail Caste.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Soon the way of fist and tail had hundreds in
it's ranks, climbing the rungs. Tynn showed them they were not warriors, but
monks.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">They would don shackles as testament to the Age
of Snake when the Iksar were a race enslaved. Inner strength and harmony were
taught. The Swifttail were born.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Swifttail were disbanded during the End
Days. It was not till the rise of the new empire under Emperor Vekin did the
caste reform. Grandmaster Glox, a former disciple of Tynn, came to New Sebilis
to rebuild the Court of Pain. In honor of Tynn, all masters now drape themselves
in a robe like he wore.</font></p>
