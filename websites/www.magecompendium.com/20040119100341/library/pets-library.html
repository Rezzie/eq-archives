<P><B>Q:</b> Which pets must be researched?<BR>
<b>A:</b> <a href="http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=3172" target="_blank" class="postlink">Visit the Spell List</a> for info on research-only pets.</P>

<P><b>Q:</b> Where can I buy my pets?<BR>
<b>A:</b> <a href="http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=3172" target="_blank" class="postlink">Visit the FAQ</a></P>

<P><b>Q:</b> What is Pet Cannibalization?<BR>
<b>A:</b> Pet Cannibalization <i>was</i> a technique used to summon pets, and then reclaim them for more mana than they initially cost. As a result of the December 18, 2003 patch, this is no longer exists in the game, for all intents and purposes.</P>

<P><b>Q:</b> Which AAs support our pets?<BR>
<b>A:</b> Pet Discipline, Quick Summoning, Mend Companion and Hasted Mending, Suspend Minion</P>

<P><b>Q:</b> What are our AA pets called?<br>
<b>A:</b> Host of the Elements, and Servant of Ro. <a href="http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=5488" target="_blank" class="postlink">Visit the FAQ</a></P>

<P><b>Q:</b> Which pet is the best?<br>
<b>A:</b> There is no such thing. Each pet has its uses, and in certain circumstances one pet is better than another. It's up to you to figure out which pet is best for each circumstance.</P>

<P><b>Q:</b> Do pets steal experience?<br>
<b>A:</b> See the <a href=#petexp>Pets and Experience</a> section.</P>

<P><b>Q:</b> What is the highest level pets can land procs and spells on?<br>
<b>A:</b> Supposedly 6 levels, or 25% more than the pet's level, whichever is highest. For example, PoP pets (level 60) can supposedly land procs on up to level 75 monsters, while the Epic pet (level 49) can only land procs up to level 61 monsters.</P>

<P><b>Q:</b> How does much DPS do pets do?<br>
<b>A:</b> There is no answer, as dps is highly dependent on what mob you are facing, which pet you're using, which direction your pet is attacking from, etc. However various parses have appeared in different spots on the forums.</P>

<P><b>Q:</b> What is the Magician Epic? Where an I find out about it?<br>
<b>A:</b> <a href="http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=2856" target="_blank" class="postlink">Read the Guide</a></P>

<P><b>Q:</b> Why does my epic pet slash for 143+?<br>
<b>A:</b> It's a bug. When the magician epic pet does its innate melee proc, and the proc gets the kill shot, it will report the pet slashing for 143+ damage. Don't be fooled, it is simply the proc, nothing more.</P>

<P><CENTER><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal"><span style="color: red"><a name=petcommands></a>Pet Commands</span></span></CENTER>

<P><i><span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal">Thanks to Master ArchMage Razamatazz Pizzazz for compiling the original basis for this listing, and for Edano, Feninie, Zacatac, Majax, Nalianna, and many others for contributing additional notes.</span></i>

<P><B>Command:</b> <i>/pet follow me</i>, or <i>/pet guard me</i><br>
<B>UI Button:</b> Follow<br>
<B>Effect:</b> puts the pet in Follow mode. This is the initial mode of a newly summoned pet. This command will overwrite <i>/pet sit </i>and <i>/pet guard here</i> and force the pet to follow its master.</P>

<P><B>Command:</b <i>/pet guard here</i> <br>
<B>UI Button</b>: Guard<br>
<B>Effect:</b> puts the pet in Guard mode.<br>
<B>Detail:</b> pet will become "parked" at its current locaton, contrary to the command wording it will not automatically attack any MOB, unless said MOB attacks its master.<br>
<B>Special Note:</b> A pet under <i>/pet guard here </i>will face the nearest NPC, including invisible mobs, traps, horses, and Eye of Zomms.</p>

<p><B>Command:</b> <i>/pet sit down</i><br>
<B>UI Button:</b> Sit<br>
<B>Effect:</b> puts the pet in Sit mode.<br>
<B>Detail:</b> works exactly like the <i>/pet guard here</i>
command with a few minor exceptions, low level pets will regen slightly faster. Once pets get thier innate regen boost in the low 30's this additional regen becomes inconsequential. Another difference between <i>/pet sit down</i> and <i>/pet guard here</i> is the pet does not "remember" its last sit point. When a mob is killed, the pet will stay with its corpse rather than returning to the point where /pet sit was issued.<br>
<B>Special Note:</b> <i>/pet sit</i> will toggle the pet's sit state, whereas <i>/pet sit down</i> will force the pet to sit. </p>

<p><B>Command:</b> <i>/pet attack</i><br>
<B>UI Button:</b> Attack<br>
<B>Effect:</b> places the owners current target onto the pet's Hate List, and ends /pet hold.<br>
<B>Detail:</b> pet will temporarily forget all prior commands and attempt to attack the target at the top of his hate list. <i>/pet attack </i>does not place the target at the top of the pets hate list, it just makes the pet attack the mob at the top of his hate list. The pet will not forget targets it already hates. It will not "forget" movement states, such as follow or guard, it will just temporarily ignore them as he attempts to attack his target. After the mob dies, the pet will return to his previous guard point, follow, or sit down, as previously commanded. The pet may be sidetracked however if another MOB begins to attack him before he has engagued the target OR if another MOB is doing signifigantly more damage to the pet thus generating enough aggro to make the pet switch targets.<br>
<B>Special Note:</b> you may also use the alternative version of this command <i>/pet kill</i><br>
<B>PvP Note:</b> unless Player versus Player is enabled, you cannot add a player or a player charmed NPC to a pet's Hate List.</P>

<p><B>Command:</b> <i>/pet kill name</i><br>
<B>Effect:</b> takes whatever would be selected by the command /target name and puts it at the top of the pet's Hate List. <br>
<B>Detail:</b> for example assume King Tormax was within range for you to <i>/target King Tormax</i>the command <i>/pet kill King Tormax</i>will order the pet to attack King Tormax regardless of what you currently have targeted. Originally a zone wide command, it was reduced to only work within the same range of the /target command.</p>

<p><B>Command:</b> <i>/pet back off</i><br>
<B>UI Button:</b> Back<br>
<B>Effect:</b> empties the pet's Hate List, causing it to stop attacking. <br>
<B>Detail:</b> while this will clear the pets hate list, if a mob atacks the pet again after this command is given it will begin attacking the mob again. This is a particular problem in areas with mobs casting large AE's. Temple of Veeshan is the most common example.</p>

<p><B>Command:</b> <i>/pet hold </i><br>
<B>Effect:</b> causes the pet to be Held, i.e. it ignores its Hate List and goes into Free mode, resuming its regular movement (either follow, guard, or sit).<br>
<B>Detail:</b> this command does not clear the pets hate list, the pet will remain "held" until you give it an attack command at which time it will attempt to attack the target at the top of its hate list. It is recommended you add the following line after <i>/pet hold </i>in a macro: <i>/pet back off</i> to ensure your pets hate list is clear. A pets hate list is frozen while it is "held", which means it does not add anyone or MOB to its hate list even if attacked.<br>
<B>Special Note:</b> the command is only available to level 59 or higher Magicians who have obtained the magician class AA skill Pet Discipline at a cost of 6 AA points. Magicials must also have spent 6 AA in General abilities and 12 AA in Archetype abilities to gain access to this AA.<br>

<p><B>Command:</b> <i>/pet taunt off</i><br>
<B>UI Button:</b> Taunt<br>
<B>Effect:</b> disables pet taunting, that is the pet will not taunt during fights.<br>
<B>Detail:</b> this command very helpful on raids or other such group encounters where summoning MOBs are involved. However, in solo situations you should generally leave taunt enabled.<br>
<B>Special Note:</b> if you omit the "off" portion of the command it will toggle the pets taunt mode (i.e. if it is on it will switch it off, and vice-versa)</p>

<p><B>Command:</b> <i>/pet taunt on </i><br>
<B>UI Button:</b> Taunt<br>
<B>Effect:</b> enables pet taunting.<br>
<B>Detail:</b> generally recommended for solo situations only.<br>
<B>Special Note:</b> if you omit the "on" portion of the command it will toggle the pets taunt mode (i.e. if it is on it will switch it off, and vice-versa)</p>

<p><B>Command:</b> <i>/pet who leader </i><br>
<B>Effect:</b> the pet will <i>/say My leader is Doofus Da'Magi.</i><br>
<B>Detail:</b> duh.</p>

<p><B>Command:</b> <i>/pet get lost</i><br>
<B>UI Button:</b> Go Away<br>
<B>Effect:</b> Instantly kills your pet.<br>
<B>Detail:</b> This will instantly kill your pet, and is one of the essential commands for a technique known as chain-petting.<br>
<B>Special Note:</b> This command is zone-wide and will kill your pet anywhere in the zone, regardless of distance from its master.</p>

<p><B>Command:</b> <i>/pet health</i><br>
<B>UI Button:</b> The Pet window itself<br>
<B>Effect:</b> Displays your pet's current health percentage and buff list in the chat window.<br>
<B>Detail:</b> This command instantly displays the current status of your pet, showing its HP percentage and current buffs/debuffs it currently has.<br>
<B>Special Note:</b> This command displays the pet's health faster than the UI can update, and is very useful when timing is critical.</p>

<p><B>Command:</b> <i>/pet target</i><br>
<B>Effect:</b> Targets your pet.<br>
<B>Detail:</b> This command clears your current target and replaces it with your pet. This is very useful for macros. However, it's often faster to simply hit the F1 key twice to target your pet.<br>
<B>Special Note:</b> This command will target special pets that borrow the name of their master (i.e. <i>Xalmat's pet</i>) instead of your summoned pet (<i>Jobaner</i>, <i>Jonartik</i>, etc). Use with caution when using such pets.</p>

<p><B>Command:</b> <i>/pet as you were</i><br>
<B>Effect:</b> Clears your pet's command list<br>
<B>Detail:</b> This tells your pet to revert to a free state. If the pet is currently under <i>/pet follow</i>, or <i>/pet guard me</i>, it will revert to a <i>/pet sit </i>state. If it is chasing an NPC, and <i>/pet as you were</i>, followed by <i>/pet back off </i>is issued, the pet will continue off in its direction of travel. This command does not break /pet hold.</p>

<CENTER><img src="images/earthpet.jpg" border="0" /><BR>
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Earth</span></CENTER>

<P>Earth is the workhorse of the elementals. It sports the most HP and the highest ATK, but the lowest AGI and DEX. From levels 4 to 49 it casts <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=969&amp;source=Live" target="_blank" class="postlink">Earth Elemental Attack</a>, a root. At 51 and 57 it casts <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1022&amp;source=Live" target="_blank" class="postlink">Earth Elemental Strike</a>, and Rathe's Son casts <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3193&amp;source=Live" target="_blank" class="postlink">Earth Elemental Strike 2</a>, both which are root with a DD component. Earth also sports a near-immunity to Disease-based spells.</P>

<CENTER><img src="images/waterpet.jpg" border="0" /><BR>
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Water</span></CENTER>

<P>Below 50, Water is the most well-rounded of the elementals, containing average stats across the board. Above 50 it takes on the characteristics of a rogue, and gains the ability to Backstab from behind, but as a side effect it loses much of its tanking capabilities.  Below 50 it casts <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=968&amp;source=Live" target="_blank" class="postlink">Water Elemental Attack</a>, and above 50 it casts <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1021&amp;source=Live" target="_blank" class="postlink">Water Elemental Strike</a>. Water is nearly immune to poison attacks, making it an excellent pet to use at low levels for this reason.
</P>

<CENTER><img src="images/airpet.jpg" border="0" /><BR>
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Air</span></CENTER>

<P>Below 50, Air is a defensive pet, sporting high AGI but low HP. Below level 50 it casts the stun <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=967&amp;source=Live" target="_blank" class="postlink">Air Elemental Attack</a>. Above level 50 its stun <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1020&amp;source=Live" target="_blank" class="postlink">Air Elemental Strike</a> gains a DD component. Air also features a near-immunity to cold based attacks.</P>

<CENTER><img src="images/firepet.jpg" border="0" /><BR>
<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: normal">Fire</span></CENTER>

<P>Below 50, Fire is a pure offense pet, sporting the DS <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=927&amp;source=Live" target="_blank" class="postlink">Fire Elemental Aura</a> and the attack <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=966&amp;source=Live" target="_blank" class="postlink">Fire Elemental Attack</a>. Above 50 it becomes a Wizard and casts various spells. The main disadvantage to Fire is its low HP, far below that of other pets. Fire also has a near-immunity to fire-based attacks.</P>

<CENTER><span style="font-size: 24px; line-height: normal"><span style="color: red"><a name=epicpet></a>Epic Pet Description</span></span></CENTER>

<P><a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1936&amp;source=Live" target="_blank" class="postlink">Manifest Elements</a>, more commonly known as the Epic pet, is the reward for the <a href="http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=2856" target="_blank" class="postlink">Magician Epic Quest</a>. It's summoned by equipping the <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=28034" target="_blank" class="postlink">Orb of Mastery</a> and right clicking the orb. When summoned it takes the appearance of an Air pet, but does not render itself invisible.</P>

<P>The pet itself is a beast. It's got massive hit points, very high melee damage, casts the damage shield <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=847&amp;source=Live" target="_blank" class="postlink">Aura of Elemental Mastery</a> (50 points of damage), procs thru melee <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=849&amp;source=Live" target="_blank" class="postlink">Elemental Mastery Blast</a> (143 points of damage), and casts the DD/stun <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=848&amp;source=Live" target="_blank" class="postlink">Elemental Mastery Strike</a> (84 points of damage).</P>

<P>You can summon the Orb of Mastery as early as level 46, but you cannot use Manifest Elements until level 50.</P>

<P><i>Previously the pets had innate resistances,<BR>
<ul>Water : Nearly Immune to Posion<BR>
Earth : Nearly Immune Disease<BR>
Air : Nearly Immune Cold<BR>
Fire : Nearly Immune Fire</ul></P>

<P>Since a recent patch however, pets supposedly use the greater of thier innate resistances and owners resists.  Verifying this actually works is somewhat of a enigma with the RNG of EQ and the shroud of mystery the developers like to keep us in. It should be noted that if the owner resists are high enough to resist a spell, then the pet will also resist that spell.</i></P>

<P><B>Description:</b> Focus items make pets "better". If you equip a focus item while summoning a pet, the pet will generally be an improved version of itself, often having better defensive and offensive stats. They have a focus effect on them denoting they are focus items. (note that focus items do not "glow" when the pet is summoned).</P>

<P><B>There are 4 Minor Focus items: Focus level 4 to 49 pets</b><BR>
These four focus items are obtainable via quest from the gnome magician Vira within the Temple of Solusek Ro located off of the Lavastorm zone.  You must have at least indifferent faction standing to quest the minor focus items.<BR>
<span style="font-size: 9px; line-height: normal"><i>*from level 34 to 49 the pets will appear visibly larger when focused</i> </span>

<P><i>Note: Data for Minor Focus items is highly outdated and needs to be re-confirmed.</i>

<P><B>There are 4 Major focus items: Focus level 49 to 60 pets.</b><BR>
They all increase their corresponding pet's level by 1 and increases the pet's HP, and increases the melee attack by 2.</P>

<P>Here are the basic rules, along with some examples - </P>

<P>Situation 1 - You are soloing and you have a summoned pet-<BR>
* If you do any damage to the monster at all, you get all of the experience. <BR>
* If you don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets 75% of the experience.</P>

<P>Situation 2 - You are in a group and you have a summoned pet-<BR>
* If you or your group do any damage to the monster at all, your group gets all of the experience.<BR>
* If you or your group don't do any damage to the monster, the pet gets 75% of the experience.<BR>

<P>Damage shields count as neutral damage; Neither you nor your pet get credit for damage done by a damage shield.</P>

<P>If your pet dies or is reclaimed mid-battle, all damage done by it is considered zero for experience purposes.</P>

<P>It makes no difference if your pet gets the killing blow or not.</P>
