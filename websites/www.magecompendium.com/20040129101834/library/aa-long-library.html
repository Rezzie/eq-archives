                  <BR>Only useful for magicians if encumberance is an issue. 
                  Usually it's better to just buy weight reducing bags.

                  for magicians. At level 65 with 5 points in this skill, this 
                  increase only amounts to a maximum 26 hit points without

                  <BR>Slightly helpful to magicians. DEX is used in conjunction 
                  with channeling skill, and every bit of DEX helps increase 
                  channeling success. <BR><BR><A name=6></A><SPAN

                  level. <BR>Useful for magicians with little to no access to 
                  INT gear, but useless if already at cap. With level 65 and 
                  more than 200 INT with 5 points in this skill, this amounts to 
                  65 more mana. With less than 200 INT, this amounts to 130

                  <BR>Useless for magicians, as wisdom has no relevance to

                  <BR>Useful for extra saves with Call of the Arch Mage and 
                  Elemental Silence. Also helps to decrease vendor prices. 
                  However, it's usually better to buy Charisma gear than
