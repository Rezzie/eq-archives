<P class=header2>Introduction to Research</P>

<P><B>When can I start Research?</B><BR>
You can begin learning research at level 16.</P>

<P><B>How do I train Research?</B><BR>
Seek your Magician guild master, and use one skill point. 

<P><B>When I train Research at level 16, how come my skill can't go above 16?</B><BR>
Research is a level restricted skill. As such, your max skill is:</P>

<P>(Level - 15) x 5</P>

<P>When you train Research at level 16, it starts your skill at Skill 16, far above the maximum possible by this formula. As such you cannot increase your skill any higher until level 19.</P>

<P><B>How do I increase Research skill in general?</B><BR>
Three ways you can increase your research skill:<BR>
Train at the Guild Master<BR>
Practice Research<BR>
Normal Research</P>

<P>You can continue training Research at the Guild Master as long as you have practice points to spare. After skill 20, the Guild Master will start charging a fee for each skill up. This fee increases each skill level.</P>

<P>Practice and Normal Research work like normal tradeskills. If you make a spell that is not trivial, there is a random chance of a skill up (based on your current INT).</P>

<P><B>What is the highest possible Research skill?</B><BR>
200. You cannot reach 200 skill until level 55.</P>

<P><B>Can I do other classes Research?</B><BR>
No. Magicians can only research Magician spells. They cannot research Enchanter, Wizard, or Necromancer spells*<BR>
<font size=2>*see the Legacy of Ykesha section for more details</font></P>

<P class=header2>Research Fundamentals</P>

<P><B>How do I actually do Research?</B><BR>
For Normal Research, Magicians use an Elemental Grimoire. You take the spell components, place them (unstacked) inside the Elemental Grimoire, and click combine. A successful combine will result in the appropriate spell scroll.</P>

<P>For Practice Research, use a Concordance of Research. Place the practice components in the Concordance along with a Quill and a Parchment. The result is a rune, and can never fail. Take two corresponding runes (Azia and Beza) and place them in the Elemental Grimoire, and hit combine. The result will be a Completed Rune (if successful) which can be sold back to the vendor. Additionally, making the completed rune will give a chance for a skillup if it is not trivial.</P>

<P><B>Where do I find components for Research?</B><BR>
Components for research are found off random monsters throughout Norrath and Luclin. Except very rarely, no research components are found in the Planes of Power.</P>

<P>Generally, you can find the appropriate research components off an appropriately matched monster level. For example, for the level 16 spells, you can find the components off monsters of level 16 and greater.</p>

<P><B>Are researched spells tradeable?</B><BR>
Yes. Until the spell itself is scribed, the spell scroll is just like any other vendor bought spell scroll, and can be traded or dropped.</P>

<P><B>Where do I find an Elemental Grimoire?</B><BR>
Elemental Grimoires can be found at any Norrath Caster Guild, as well as in the cities Katta Castellum, Sanctus Seru, and Shadowhaven.</P>

<P><B>Where can I find a Concordance of Research?</B><BR>
There are quests one can perform to find a Concordance of Research.<BR>
Those of good alignment should seek Mrysilla in the Northern Karanas.<BR>
Those of evil alignment should seek Smith Tv`Ysa in the Southern Desert of Ro.</P>

<P class=header2>Legacy of Ykesha</P>

<P><B>What about Legacy of Ykesha Research?</B><BR>
Legacy of Ykesha research is used for Level 50+ spells. The book used is called an Arch Magus Grimoire. Seek the researchers in the Gulf of Gunthak for acquiring one.</P>

<P>As an aside, an Arch Magus Grimoire can be used instead of an Elemental Grimoire. However the Arch Magus Grimoire is NO DROP while the Elemental Grimoire is not.</P>

<P><B>Where do Legacy of Ykesha research components drop?</B><BR>
Legacy of Ykesha research components seem to drop off any very high level monster in Norrath and Luclin. High level dungeons have been known to have a steady stream of LoY components.</P>

<P><B>Can Magicians do other classes Legacy of Ykesha research?</B><BR>
Yes and No.</P>

<P>Magicians can only do Magician spell research. They cannot do other INT class research.</P>

<P>However, Magicians CAN do WIS spell research. That is, Magicians can do spell research for Druids, Clerics, and Shamans, in addition to their own spells. This ONLY applies to Legacy of Ykesha research.</P>

<P class=header2>Other</P>

<P><B>Why do Normal Research?</B><BR>
One reason: Need. Many of the spells that are researchable are not vendor sold. Therefore if a magician wants those spells, they must be researched.</P>

<P><B>Why do Legacy of Ykesha Research</B><BR>
Legacy of Ykesha research was introduced as an alternate means of gathering spells aside from monster drops. The magician has a choice of looting a spell through normal means, or can gather the components and research.</P>

<P>Additionally, the same is true for WIS class spells. These classes can either loot the spells the traditional way, or seek an INT class researcher to research the spells for them.</P>

<P><B>Why do Practice Research?</B><BR>
Practice Research is in place to provide an alternate means of increasing research skill. Practice Research is generally cheaper than Normal Research.</P>

<P><B>What is Chain Research?</B><BR>
One of the penalties of Magician research is that each spell requires another spell scroll from the previous spell circle. As such, high level spells require one to research all of the lower level spells first.</P>

<P>While modern magicians don't feel the brunt of this nearly as hard as their predecessors, remnants of Chain Research are still present.</P>

<P>This does not apply to Legacy of Ykesha Research or Practice Research.</P>
