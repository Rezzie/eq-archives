<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Oh, I was worried for a second. People say
&quot;confrontation&quot; and I assume that they mean that someone was wronged
or did something bad.&nbsp; Ok, on to your issues:</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">I asked him: &quot;So what your saying is,
  in the world of Norrath if your not able to receive harm from your enemies,
  your &quot;cheating&quot; or breaking the rules.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;He said:
  &quot;Well, look at this way, while your up on the roof the monsters don't
  know that you exist.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well actually, the creatures don't know how to
get to you, and since they don't know how to get to you, they *settle* for
attacking the people in your party. Though this may sound like a reasonable
tactic, it's really not. The existence of a world-geometry feature shouldn't
make you, for all intents and purposes, invulnerable to attack. If we didn't
make acts such as this illegal, *everyone* would then do it, and then the game
is a joke.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A standing rule in EQ is that any creature
should be able to get to you anywhere. If they can't, then it's a bug (in this
case, a pathing bug). Now it could be looked at in one of two ways, either the
creature doesn't know how to get to you and that's a bug, or you were allowed to
get someplace that you shouldn't have, and that's a bug. In either case, using a
bug for personal gain is exploitation, and that's why a warning would be issued.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">But by the Guide's logic (&quot;...the
  monsters don't know that you exist.&quot;), zoning with a train or a single
  creature on your rear is just as illegal.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Zoning is an acceptable and intended method of
breaking combat. It's not a bug that the critter doesn't follow you through the
zone. It is a bug that he doesn't go up on top of the house.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Gordon, please explain where I am wrong</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If AI (artificial intelligence) ever gets to
the point that it is as adaptable as human intelligence, then you wouldn't be
wrong, as the critter could figure out how to get up there. Until then, we have
to make allowances for the fact that a computer will never be as smart as the
player encountering it (most of them anyway.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">From now on, if you find a place of
  safety, other than the next zone over, from your enemies... then by all means
  use it! This is a smart idea because you have a better chance of living and
  defeating your enemy.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, that would get you booted from the game,
per my comments above.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">From now on, so that law abiding citizens
  of Norrath will not get into trouble with a Guide: all known &quot;safe
  areas&quot; where creatures cannot harm you should be posted on the EverQuest
  web site somewhere, and should be regularly be checked in-game by Guides for
  exploitation</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well they are checked as people /petition to
report exploitation. Quite frankly, we don't want the guides to have to waste
time by popping from one possible exploit site to another just to make regular
rounds. If someone reports exploitation, then we'll go there. We might also stop
by if a new area has opened up and become a free for all.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for listing all of the places on the site,
I'll be honest, it won't happen. To use an analogy (and I love analogies),
suppose a bank security system has a bug where all the doors and the vault
unlock from 2-3am. Would they announce this to everyone? No, but they would
still bust the guy who &quot;wanders&quot; into the vault completely by
accident.&nbsp; Yes, I know, they'd post a security guard too, but you get my
point.</font>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Neither can I see Verant doing... but
  hopefully some middle ground can be met, and action can be taken that matches
  the general idea of this post. I honestly didn't know that was an illegal spot
  to be, and got an official warning from a Guide</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The middle ground is that we give people the
benefit of the doubt and issue a warning.&nbsp; The guides will tell you, much
as this one did, that anything not being able to get to you is a bug, therefore
standing in someplace that insures this to be so is exploitation.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You needn’t worry about getting a warning for
something like this.&nbsp; It happens to many people.&nbsp; We only worry about
people who get several for similar infractions.</font>

for &quot;Doing Dungeons&quot;... there is no way to &quot;DO&quot; dungeons.
I'm assuming the definition of &quot;Doing a dungeon&quot; is to wander in
deeper killing stuff as you go. As it is now... every room is camped.<P.<B>
 It's a vicious circle. No one can do a dungeon because everything is camped.
Everything is camped because no one will do a dungeon. If everyone were to stop
camping, and start doing dungeons, things would work out nicely. Of course,
people tend to follow the course of least resistance, and doing a dungeon is far
harder than camping.</font>

held a particular spawn, and policing it would be a complete nightmare even if

<font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">1. Was the zone in Debuff part of
the original game plan or a change made to prevent people from accessing the
platforms out of order ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was a measure to prevent people from zoning
in with levitate, which then enabled them to get to islands out-of-order.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If it was a preventative measure why was the
level of the islands not altered to prevent people from moving up out of order?
(Besides a new download)</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The new download is a big part of it. Changing
world geometry leads to having to download the entire zone again. The other
thing though is that our people who are capable of doing world geometry are tied
up for a while. There are also more problems than just allowing people to get to
islands out of order, it's letting them get down to an island that they've
already been to.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">2. Since the new change people
are no longer able to access the starting platform once the get higher up. (You
used to be able to float down) You have to jump off and gate back up. Costing a
player upwards of 250p per trip. Are the costs to get into sky going to be
changed to reflect this new demand ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not at this time. Perhaps if we see an
excessive shortage of platinum, we might reevaluate our money sinks so that they
are in line with the means of the players.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">3. What is the average amount
of cash that a level 46+ player (ballpark it) has on his person ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Most folks that I know usually
have between 500p and 1k.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Off the top of my head, I'm not sure. I suppose
it depends on your class. I know a few enchanters with over 30K in the bank. I
know that as a solo high-40s Necromancer, I can make over 200pp per hour, and I
have 3500pp in the bank.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Considering that there are auctions out there
for hundreds of thousands of platinum, I think there's probably still enough of
it out there.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">4. We spent around of 15000p -
18000p so far this week getting to Gorgolask platform in Plane of Air for a 30
person trip. That's 500-600p per person so far. Is this the target Verant is
looking for ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Considering that the only mandatory cost in the
Plane of Sky is the component to zone in, with everything else being optional
for short-cuts, it sounds ok. Of course, the entire zone is supposed to be the
pinnacle of difficulty.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">5. Do the above figures
encourage farming of items to gather easy cash for these trips ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I think that people are probably depleting
their reserves before resorting to farming. They can also start selling some of
the items they find in the world for plat, rather than making them trade-only.
There's a bit of this going on currently, and overall the economy is getting
healthy.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">6. I get the feeling that Plane
of Air is a work in progress. Should we expect any other &quot;high impact&quot;
(high impact to me was the &quot;anti buff&quot; patch) changes to the zone or
is it getting close to Verant's &quot;vision&quot; for Plane of Air ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I won't call any zone perfect, but we think we
have it pretty well figured out. That's not to say that we won't have to make a
change or two should no one ever be able to reach the top, or should some
loophole be found that makes it entirely too easy, but it's looking good at
present.</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">7. One last comment/question...
If I had been given a choice of loosing buffs or moving the islands I would have
chosen the latter. I feel being able to levitate in Plane of Air... with all the
mobs that can cast blowback and gravity flux... is useful for keeping yourself
in Plane of Air and preventing damage to yourself. Is it possible to have the
islands adjusted to prevent people from exploiting levitate ?</font>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Another 30 minute patch makes
me no difference if the change is a good one.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We don't have any plans at present to change
zone geometry. As mentioned above, we have all the people who are capable of
that tied up for a while.</font>

website.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello Everyone,</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Back in October, Jeff Butler, EverQuest’s
Customer Service Manager, outlined some new Customer Service Guidelines in the
Producets Letter. Shortly after these policies were publicized, we announced
that their implementation would be postponed pending some revisions necessary to
insure enforceability and consistency across the servers and different levels of
our Customer Service organization. Last week, our policy team completed their
public revision of those policies, and we are ready to implement them at this
time. Before we get in to the wording of the &quot;Play Nice Policies&quot;,
I’d like to take a moment to discuss their spirit, and why we feel that they
are necessary.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">EverQuest continues to astound everyone
involved with it almost daily. Nearly one year since we opened our doors,
EverQuest boasts a community of current players numbering nearly 200,000, most
of whom still play on a daily basis. In all actuality, EverQuest has gone beyond
what could be described with a term such as &quot;community&quot;. We are all,
in fact, part of the EverQuest Society.<br>
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Like any society, each person has the ability
to place his or her mark upon it. The vast majority of people in our society do
their best to insure that their mark is positive, by abiding to the laws that
we, much like the government, bring forward. Some of you choose to become
pinnacles of honor, dignity, and respect in your individual communities by
forming guilds, promoting honorable actions by your members, and by supporting
EverQuest on your web-sites.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Also like any society, we have our underbelly,
a relatively small number of people who live to prey upon the honorable. It is
frequently the goal of these people to see to their desires, no matter the
effect of their actions upon others around them. They are the ones who claim
ownership of servers, zones, or spawns, and cause or threaten harm to anyone who
does not share their disregard and contempt. They are the ones who live, not to
enjoy the game with everyone else, but to enjoy at everyone else’s expense.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For the first few months after EverQuest’s
release, we felt that a policy of non-interference in many of these matters was
warranted. However, we continued to lose good players. This was not due to any
deficiency or dissatisfaction in the game, but due to dissatisfaction with the
treatment that they received from their fellow players, and the perceived
inability of our Customer Service department to intervene. Late last year, we
made a commitment to our players to begin playing an active role in many of
these situations.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The intent of these policies is to provide the
players with general guidelines for what is or is not acceptable behavior in
EverQuest, and give them with the opportunity to work out differences prior to
involving the EverQuest Customer Service Staff. Naturally, in a game as
multifaceted as EverQuest, we are not able to cover every possible issue that
could arise as part of these policies. In these cases, it is the spirit of a
rule that will prevail over any discrepancies in the letter.</font></p>
<p><u><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></b></u></p>
<p><u><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Play Nice Policies: A
revision to the GM/Guide FAQ and the Rules of Conduct.</font></b></u></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The policies below are now in effect and will
be reflected in the GM/Guide and conduct FAQ in the near future.</font></p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Kill Stealing</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Kill Stealing will now be regarded as
    disruption and will result in disciplinary action when witnessed by any
    EverQuest Customer Service Representative (EQCSR). The EQCSR will review
    these situations on an individual basis and issue a decision which is
    considered binding upon all parties involved. Kill Stealing is defined as
    the killing of a mob for any reason that is already fighting or pursuing
    another player or group.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The intent of this rule is discourage and
    make note of habitual Kill Stealers, not to punish those who honestly try to
    work together or those who make an honest mistake. Its enforcement by the
    EverQuest Customer Service Staff will reflect this philosophy.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Contested Spawns</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are cases where two or more groups
    wish to kill the same thing. In these cases, the groups are required to
    compromise. If an equitable compromise cannot be reached between the players
    prior to EverQuest Customer Service Staff involvement, the EQCSR will
    mandate a binding compromise. Refusing to abide by a compromise mandated by
    an EQCSR will be considered disruption. It is therefore strongly suggested
    that the groups make every attempt to reach a compromise that they can live
    with prior to involving an EQCSR, who may mandate a compromise that does not
    suit you to the extent that a player-devised compromise would.</font></p>
    <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Note: A &quot;group&quot; in this case
    is defined as a party of one or more characters that are united in a common
    belief or goal and are capable of completing that goal.</font></i></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Foul Language</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Excessive use of foul language in an
    inappropriate context, including swear words, real-world racial slurs, and
    other language that is not consistent with the fantasy environment and
    designed to hurt, will be considered a disruption. The existence of the
    filter (/filter) is not a license to be profane.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Harassment</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Harassment is defined as specifically
    targeting another player or group of players to harm or inconvenience them.
    Harassment can take many forms, as it goes to the state-of-mind of the
    person or party on the receiving end of the action. However, in order to
    account for those who are excessively thin-skinned, the EQCSR involved will
    make a determination as to whether or not the average person would feel
    &quot;harassed&quot; and act accordingly.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Zone/Area Disruption</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Zone/Area Disruption is defined as any
    activity designed to harm or inconvenience a number of groups rather than a
    specific player or group of players. This includes things such as:</font></p>

<ul>

      <ul>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Monopolizing most or all of the kills
          in an area.</font>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Deliberately blocking a doorway or
          narrow area so other players cannot get past.</font>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Refusing to cooperate with the other
          parties at a contested spawn site after having been instructed to do
          so by an EQCSR.</font>
        <li><font size="2" face="Verdana">Making excessive and inappropriate use
          of zone-wide communications (/shout, /ooc, /auction).</font></li>
      </ul>
    </dir>
  </dir>
</ul>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
<dir>
  <dir>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Reports of Fraud</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fraud in all transactions between players
    will result in disciplinary action when confirmed by an internal EQCSR.
    Fraud is defined as falsely representing one’s intentions to make a gain
    at another’s expense. Examples of this activity include but are not
    limited to offering to recover possessions from the corpse of another player
    and refusing to return that property to it’s owner as well as using flaws
    in a secure trade window to deprive someone of one of their items.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Guilds</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Disciplinary issues involving guilds will
    also be addressed on a broader basis. Guilds whose members habitually
    violate any of the Rules of Conduct or Play Nice Policies may be disbanded.
    In addition, monopolizing numerous spawn areas with the intent to exclude
    other players will not be permitted. If investigated and verified by an
    internal EQCSR, monopolizing will result in the disbanding of the guild.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Training NPCs</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The intentional training of NPCs will
    result in immediate disciplinary action when witnessed by an EQCSR. We are
    aware that accidents often happen causing unintentional trains, and will
    scrutinize each report of this activity closely.</font></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">Abuse</font></b></p>

    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></b></p>
    <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">PvP Servers</font></b></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The PvP Servers are a special case for many
    of the policies listed here. When one makes the decision to play on a PvP
    Server, they are in essence agreeing to play on a server where compromise is
    decided on the basis of who has the power to kill whom.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">By the same token, we expect that the
    people on those servers will apply PvP combat in all situations where it is
    called for, as a resolution to the problem. As such, the EverQuest Customer
    Service Staff will decline to intervene in cases where a PvP alternative
    exists, such as at disputed spawns where the parties involved have the
    ability to attack each other.</font></p>
    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Though the PvP environment does eliminate a
    few of the problems experienced on the normal servers, there are a few more
    PvP-specific problems that are created.</font></p>
    <dir>
      <dir>
        <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Causing Experience Loss</font></i></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Intentionally causing experience-loss
        to other players in the PvP environment is illegal in all cases and will
        result in a warning when witnessed by an EQCSR. This includes things
        such as intentionally training NPCs, and purposefully allowing an NPC to
        get the final blow in combat. We do understand that there are cases
        where the experience-loss is unintentional, and will take no action
        unless a person earns a reputation of causing unintentional
        experience-loss.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Much like how the Kill Stealing rule
        applies to those on the blue servers, this rule is designed to
        discourage and make note of those who do it habitually, thus betraying
        the spirit of PvP. As a note, the EQCSR will not in any case provide a
        resurrection for someone who was caused experience loss in PvP,
        intentionally or otherwise. This is one of the dangers of playing on a
        PvP server.</font></p>
        <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></i></p>
        <p><i><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bind-point/Corpse Camping</font></i></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Killing someone over and over again
        while at his or her bind-point or while they are in the process of
        retrieving their corpse is illegal and will result in a warning when
        witnessed by an EQCSR. You are expected in all cases to give someone a
        reasonable amount of time to recover their corpse an leave the area

        words, sitting next to your corpse and taunting someone while daring
        them to attack you so that you can /petition them is bad form, and would
        result in a warning if witnessed by an EQCSR.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The EQCSR in attendance will decide
        what is reasonable in these cases. It is highly recommended that the

    the claim of &quot;Role-play&quot; will not be accepted in defense of any of

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">To quote the Producers Letter from October 20,
1999, Verant GM-Administrators review records of disciplinary incidents on a
daily basis. Action is taken based on the severity and nature of the offense,
and/or the number of warnings issued to the customer. These actions may include
but are not limited to, temporary suspension or permanent banning from the game.
Be advised that you may not receive any notification or warnings, in-game or
otherwise, prior to disciplinary action being taken against your account.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We ask that everyone give these new policies
some time before judging their effectiveness. Our intent is to further our
philosophy that no one player should ever be allowed to intentionally ruin the
gameplay experience of another, a philosophy to which we are firmly committed.
These policies will continue to adapt as we learn new ways to deal with
particular issues, and discover new issues that need to be specifically
addressed.</font></p>

is a Multiplayer game, and as such, people have to interact with other people.
The focus of these rules will be to form some guidelines for these interactions,
and provide the GMs and Guides a course of action in the event that some people
purposely attempt to reduce the amount of fun that another person can have. You
all pay the same amount of money to play the game, and thus deserve the same
options while here.</font>

the goal is to provide some tools that allow people to work out situations on
their own and not involve the GM/Guide staff who should be focused on adding
content and dealing with real customer-service issues. I think that the rules,
which will be outlined next week in the Producer’s Letter, will result in more
short-term intervention by the GM/Guide staff, but will empower people to solve
their own problems in the long run.</font>

quite an enigma why the Ring of Scale has not yet disposed of you.<br>

the meaningless insults, yes? There is something of more importance with which I
require your assistance.'<br>

rumor, and should not be confused with fact'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore grins evilly at A young dragon.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Of course, milady.'<br>
A young dragon says, 'The Lady Vox, when she was cast out of the Ring, marked a
traitor to her own, was said to have fled with the shard as her final revenge
upon the Ring. It is said that she clutches the shard within her own claw.'<br>
A young dragon says, 'That is all I know'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore raises his hand, motioning for Lord Galendore to approach.<br>

someone of great power as well as being eminently expendable'<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Where would one find this man, milord?'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'He has taken a brief residence within Dagnor` Cauldron.
We will need him to retrieve a shard. For what reasons, he need not know. The
reward for his assistance and success shall be great'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore turns back to the dragon, nearly unconscious from the wounds
she has suffered.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Thank you milady, for your cooperation. Unfortunately,

Mayong Mistmoore begins to cast a spell.<br>

you as the man you shall be seeking is not one to be underestimated. Be swift,

Lord Galendore bows.<br>
Lord Galendore forces a smile of respect across his twisted face.<br>
Lord Galendore nods towards the filthy dwarf standing among the crowd.<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Kivgor Illbriar, would you please step forward? I have a
small business proposition for you'<br>
Kivgor Illbriar makes his way through the crowd, pausing for a moment in
mid-step, he turns his head toward the ground.<br>
Kivgor Illbriar opens his mouth, a deep gurgling emerges from the dwarf's throat
as he spits the tobacco onto the ground.<br>
Lord Galendore raises his head slightly at the dwarf, a sneer of impatience
crossing his brow.<br>
Kivgor Illbriar wipes his jaw with his forearm before proceeding towards the
Teir'dal.<br>
Kivgor Illbriar says, 'These 'lil buggers tell me that ye wanted ta' 'ave a
meetin' with me, fer a proposition.. er somethin' to that effect, aye?'<br>
Kivgor Illbriar reaches into the small pouch, pulling a small bit of tobacco and
places it in between his lower lip and jaw.<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Yes, they have informed you correctly, Kivgor'<br>
Kivgor Illbriar raises an eyebrow at the Teir'dal, puffing out his red cheeks as
he spits a bit of brown juice onto the ground.<br>
Kivgor Illbriar says, 'Yeh yeh, I already got that part... but WHAT is it
exactly ye want me t'do? And 'ow much are ye goin' t'be payin' me t'do yer
work?'<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'It is a small task and shouldn't be too far out of your
league. There is a family relic that is dear to my master, something that is
even older than he'<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Unfortunately, this treasure has fallen into the grasps of
the White Lady, Vox'<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Your task, if you choose to accept, is to retrieve this
shard from the dragon's lair'<br>
Kivgor Illbriar raises his eyebrows in surprise towards Lord Galendore. Opening
his mouth to speak, he is interrupted by the Teir'dal's words.<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'We have heard greatly of your abilities, as well as that
of many other. We sought you first, as we have great faith in you, Kivgor'<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'If you do not accept this task, then we shall ask another,
although in truth, you prove to be the one of most worth'<br>
Kivgor Illbriar closes his jaw, turning his head as he scans the area around
him. His eyes gleaming with interest, he takes a few steps closer to Lord
Galendor.<br>
Kivgor Illbriar says, 'That be true, dark one?'<br>
Lord Galendore grins wickedly at the dwarf.<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Aye, Kivgor, every word'<br>
Kivgor Illbriar says, 'Alright then, I'll take up yer little job.'<br>
Lord Galendore nods in approval towards Kivgor Illbriar and extends his hand for
the dwarf to take.<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'A most wise choice, Kivgor'<br>
Kivgor Illbriar reaches out to take the hand of Lord Galendore, forcefully
shaking the Teir'dal's hand in agreement.<br>
Clouds spread over the sky, concealing the rays of the sun from the waters of
Cauldron<br>
The light now a murky gray, shadows begin to rise from the corners of the lake,
coming together over the Dwarf and Teir`Dal as a towering pillar of darkness.
Stopping out of these same shadows, a tall figure approaches the dwarf<br>

by....'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore motions to the dwarf to cease his words.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'No, Kivgor. You will venture alone, as this is a task
requiring much stealth and skill. I feel it would be best for you to go alone
due to the nature of this task.'<br>
Kivgor Illbriar says, 'Oh? Alright then.. I'll fetch yer trinket. Any particular
time ye want it back?'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore flashes a gentle grin of amusement towards Kivgor,
&quot;Immediately&quot;<br>
Kivgor Illbriar spits one last time, barely missing Lord Galendore's shoe.
Flashing a toothy grin towards Mayong, the dwarf throws down a small potion, the
glass bottle shattering as it hits the ground.<br>
Kivgor Illbriar is surrounded by a massive cloud of smoke and dust, fading away
from view as the smoke is blown with the wind...<br>
Mayong Mistmoore leans towards Lord Galendore.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Somehow, I do not feel that this dwarf will be
successful as anticipated. Your thoughts, Galendore?'<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'He has promise, but I believe his ego and overweighed
vanity would prevent him from succeeding'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore lowers his head in thought, grazing his chin with his hand. For
a moment, he pauses and then turns his head to Lord Galendore.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Galendore...'<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'aye, milord?'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'send for the priestess, as well as Khasra. They shall
accompany you to the caverns of the north where you will ensure the dwarf's
victory.'<br>
Lord Galendore bows before Mayong Mistmoore.<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'Immediately, milord'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Galendore, one more thing before you go.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'These mortals...'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore waves his hand in the direction of the crowd.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Which of these mortals has been of greatest service to
you this day, Galendore?'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore eyes the crowd as he speaks to Lord Galendore, searching the
minds of those around for Galendore's answer.<br>
Lord Galendore points at Aludian. Yeah you!<br>
Aludian bows before Lord Galendore.<br>
Lord Galendore says, 'That one, milord, Aludian I believe is his given name. One
who isnt too bright, but provided as much help as can be expected from a mortal'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore leans down further towards Lord Galendore's ear.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore keeps his eyes upon the one Galendore indicated as he whispers
a series of words to the Teir`Dal in a language unknown to any who dwell within
this realm and time.<br>
Lord Galendore nods at Mayong Mistmoore.<br>
Aludian bows before Mayong Mistmoore.<br>
Lord Galendore approaches Aludian, his hands dropping to the elaborately
embroidered belt around his waist.<br>
Lord Galendore stops in front of Aludian, nodding in respect as he removes the
belt from his waist.<br>
Lord Galendore gently folds the belt in half, keeping his eyes locked upon those
of Aludians as he outstretches his arms in offering of the belt.<br>
Lord Galendore bows before Aludian.<br>
Aludian bows before Lord Galendore.<br>
Aludian bows before Mayong Mistmoore.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore closes his eyes and lowers his head and he thanks, Aludian.
From behind a mask of shadows, the vampire opens his eyes, staring into
Aludian's eyes.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'I shall not forget your services to me, mortal child.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore raises his head as he walks towards Aludian. Stopping only
inches from Aludian, Mayong raise his wrist up to his chest, his dark robes
folding down his forearm.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'As I shall not forget you, neither shall you forget me.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore lifts his other hand to his wrist, slashing violently across
the blue flesh with his claw-like nails.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore reaches into the folds of his robes, withdrawing a small vial
encased within a bat's skull to the open wound, allowing the vial to completely
fill.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore lowers his wrist, still holding the vile of his blood up to
Aludian.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'Let this be a gift to you, a gift of the most personal
nature.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore raises his head, tilting it slightly to the side as he speaks,
his voice now trembling with strength.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore says, 'A warning to you, child. To accept this, is to do
nothing, but to drink of it, is to pledge yourself to me. Eternity's Knight,
forever you shall be.'<br>
Mayong Mistmoore grins sadistically at Aludian as he hands over the vial.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore chuckles evilly.<br>
Mayong Mistmoore bows.<br>
Aludian says, 'I thank you Lord Galendore and Lord Mayong Mistmorre'</font></p>
