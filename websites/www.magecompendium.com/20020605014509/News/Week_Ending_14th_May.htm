got some time late Wednesday and went into an area that is supposed to be

revisit the fizzle percentages. As I mentioned before, it is true that spells
will fizzle a good deal on the level that you get the spell, but we might need
to do something to take into account that spell skills don't go up. Also, we'll
probably definitely need to take a look at the level 60 spell fizzle rates since
no one will reach 61 to get the big reduction.<br>

Newbie Guards<br>
<br>
As we are sure many people are aware, there are guards that exist specifically
for the purpose of giving new characters a place to run in order to be saved
from a certain death. However, as many people have mentioned, these guards are
frequently either dead, or engaged by players choosing to hunt them. This makes
things very frustrating for newer players, and with the large influx of new
players due to the release of EverQuest: The Ruins of Kunark, we decided that a
change was warranted.<br>
<br>
Though we do not have a problem with players choosing to hunt guards, the newbie
guards themselves, specifically the ones at the gates of cities and in the
vicinity of newbie zones, need to remain alive under most circumstances. To that
end, we have buffed up these newbie-protecting guards, made them immune to
magic, and given them some pretty good healing properties, in order to make them
less attractive to people hunting them.<br>
<br>
In addition, though we have left the guards inside cities as-is from the
perspective of power, we've also found a problem with the respawn rate.
Previously they were typically on a six-minute timer, making them spawn much
faster than an equivalent NPC would in a dungeon. We have normalized the respawn
time of guards inside cities to bring them in line with dungeon NPCs.<br>
<br>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Greetings.
I am Head GM Tarn and i have some information that concerns your<br>
account. Now this is fairly serious so lets get right down to it. THIS IS<br>
NOT A SCAM BTW. Verent has your account to be destroyed due to your auction<br>
on ebay. This is where i come in.. I am here to help you. I have worked for<br>
Verent with the EQ game since it started and i have put up with his sjkad<br>
for a long time now and he has went to far when he decided to destroy<br>
accounts due to the selling/trading. So if you truly want to save your<br>
account here are some suggestions.<br>
<br>
1: Take your bid off ebay ASAP and try changing the password to something<br>
else. This method doesnt ensure that you will keep your account active.<br>
<br>
2: Try just taking your bid off ebay and staying off line for about 1 week<br>
or so... This is the most unefficent way to save your accout. OR<br>
<br>
3: I know this sounds just like the MOTD(message of the day) That is posted<br>
when you log in but this is like almost 90-99% most efficient to save your<br>
account. I need both your station name and password so i can change ALL the<br>
information on your account.<br>
<br>
Now lets start with the basics, Why a station name and password? So i can<br>
get into your account and change your characters names and this is most<br>
important. I need to change your station name. Thats right STATION name.<br>
That is what verent most bases his destruction on. Why? Well thats simple<br>
that is the one thing that the average player can't change with out some<br>
help. Now you may elect to contact customer service and have them change it,<br>
But they wont. Not because they cant but because they have been instructed<br>
not to. This is up to you so be patient on your decision. Now remember this<br>
100% all the time while deciding what to do. THIS IS NOT A SCAM. If you<br>
really want your account to make some money for you on ebay then i suggest<br>
you do one of these methods. Either 1,2, or 3.<br>
<br>
Thanks and stay in contact.<br>
<br>
Head GM Tarn</font></p>

I mean, my god the last post about this (now locked, I wonder why?) has 448
replies, more than I've seen any other thread have so far. I can't believe
Verant won't even address the issue more. It's not going to just go away.</font></p>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">I'm sorry guys, but the binding issue is
absolutely a dead horse, which is why I'm not jumping in the threads to remind
everyone about that more than once a month or so.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The game has been out for over a year. In that
time, melee characters have survived and prospered, even though the binding
arrangements haven't changed.&nbsp; Melee characters will continue to thrive
without implementing something such as this that would drastically change the
pace of the game, game balance, class interdependency, and the penalty for
death.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Binding is an advantage of being a pure caster
in the same fashion that the ability to dish out melee damage, wear protective
armor, etc., is an advantage of being a melee player.&nbsp; My advice to you is
to make friends with clerics, wizards, druids, and anyone else who can make your
travel go quicker.</font>

magic user could scribe certain spells. I mean if nothing else make the spell
lore so they can have only one copy of it at a time.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Ok the real point of this
topic. If at level 12 a magic user could scribe a bind scroll he could sell it
to warriors so they could bind themselves in town only. And could only carry one
because of it being lore. This would still promote the interaction with
characters, but one take some of the hassle out of getting a bind.</font></p>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Oh... and as for scripting
other spells. I think it would be cool, but the scribing of bind is my main
concern here.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Spell scrolls don't work this way. What you are
basically describing is how a potion works, and potions can only be made via the
Alchemy skill. Though it may not contain all of the potions that people wish
for, it's the only way expendable spell-casting items can be created.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since we don't allow anyone to create anything
of value without some effort, opening some way for magic users to create
expendable spell-casting items would basically have it working in the same
fashion as alchemy, a skill that we want to keep as a benefit only for Shaman.</font>

seem to be a couple of issues here in the thread, the first being linking groups
for shared experience, and the second being linking groups for enhanced
communication. In both of these cases, we've weighed the various pros and cons
of each situation and decided against them.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
Linking groups for shared experience isn't feasible from a technical standpoint.
The code that determines how experience is split up, and the group tracking
mechanisms in game are part of the central core of EverQuest, something that we
would rather leave intact and instead focus our time on adding new content to
the game.<br>
<br>
Shared communication has been ruled out both for that reason (though
communication would probably be easier), and to increase the challenge of
encounters that require multiple groups. One thing that is difficult about these
encounters is that communication is difficult, where it should be. You have 30
people in a room all going after the same critter, and it takes real skill to
keep everything sorted out, even with everything filtered out via the chat
filters.<br>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Can you give us an update on the
clipping plane bug please ?</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We're still trying to isolate the problem.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We've not been able to reproduce it in-house.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We are trying to see if it's related to certain
video cards, but have yet to see a pattern.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here's how the clipping plane works in EQ :</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Each zone has information about it in a 'Zone
Header' -- this includes the type of zone, the name of the zone, the chance of
rain/snow, etc. It also includes a min and max view distance (clip distance).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Your clipping plane slider bar works on a
percentage basis. So, let's say you have it set in the middle, approximately at
50%. One zone might have a min of 500 and a max of 1000 feet viewable distance.
In that zone, you'd see 750 feet. Another zone, however, might have a min of 500
and a max of 1500, in which case you'd be seeing 1000 feet unless you adjusted
the slider.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are two factors related to how we set the
maximum distance: 1. ambiance and 2. how the zone was created. Some zones, for
example fog enshrouded forests, have a max clip purposely set lower for effect.
Most zones, however, have the max very close to the drawing distance set by the
zone creator when he exported the zone. In other words, if we set it any higher
you'd see visual anomalies or simply not see the world at all.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In any case, you should see some change when
you adjust your slider. The more variance between the min and max, the more
variance you'll see.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">We will continue to try to isolate why there
are some reports that the final 25% to 50% of moving the slider does nothing.</font>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">I don't think Abashi is the bad
guy here people, he's not the one making your class &quot;less fun&quot; to
play. You are and Verant is. Not Abashi personally. He's just a guy who reads
the posts, talks to Verant, and writes what they tell him. So why don't you all
lay off Abashi and go after the men who really make the laws in EQ....Brad and
John.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You are correct in a sense.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Abashi primarily posts answers to questions,
policies, etc.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He absolutely has influence in decisions, but
no less and no more than most people.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Game decisions related to EQ are made by committee.
We have tuning meetings where game designers, programmers, and other interested
parties participate in debating current issues, coming up with new ideas, and
deciding in general where things should go.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Smed rarely if ever gets involved in in-game
issues.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">For a long time I moderated and led the tuning
meetings, but that is done primarily by the Producer of the EQ Live team now.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In any case, we are a team, and we collectively
make decisions and preserve and protect the Vision(TM). Which is why, IMHO, EQ
is such a great game: the teams behind the game care deeply about the game and
have a lot of passion for it. This is the game we wanted to make, it's the game
we play, and it's the game we will continue to build and enhance, all the while
making sure it remains true to what EQ was (and is) all about.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But, then, if you really want to blame someone
in particular, you might as well blame me.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">And so be nice to Abashi -- thanks.</font>
