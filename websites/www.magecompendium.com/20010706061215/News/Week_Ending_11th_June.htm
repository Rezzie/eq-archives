It depends on the specific situation.<br>

Depending upon what the person involved has done, there may or may not be a
warning, or warnings issued prior to taking more severe action.<br>
<br>
Suspensions are documented and approved by a Lead. Bans are documented and
approved by the head GM. In either case, word of the action is sent to the email
address of record, the one they set within the EQ account data interface. The
appeal route is different for each instance and is explained in the email that
informs them of the action.<br>

Patch Addendum<br>
<br>
A few changes were not included in the patch message earlier today:<br>
<br>
- Banshee Aura has had its duration increased.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Scale of Wolf and Spirit of Scale will no longer be canceled by being the target of a melee attack. Ranged attacks and spells will still cancel the spell.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Shaman can now cast Charm Animal</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Some enchanter and shaman spells have had their casting times/mana costs altered.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Augment, Glamour of Kintaz, Rapture, and Clarity II have had their mana cost lowered.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Root spells that cause damage (Druid roots, Hungry Earth) now work properly.<br>
<br>
Additionally, NPCs now have a maximum amount that they can be slowed prior to being damaged.  This change should only affect users of the 54th level Bard song, which, when coupled with the bard "fear" song allowed them to stop fleeing NPCs completely, while rendering them unable to make any attacks.&nbsp;<br>

<font size="2" face="Verdana">In a recent thread on this subject, Abashi
responded :</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">&quot;I believe I mentioned
before that this isn't a bug. Player characters get one chance to accept a
resurrection. If they refuse, they can still be transported to the site with a
resurrection, but won't get experience.&quot;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">That is completely accurate, but does not
precisely capture the entire issue. If a player does not accept the Resurrection
(or Resuscitate) for ANY reason they have completely lost the opportunity to
receive a restoration of experience. Those reasons can include:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Being AFK and the cleric not bothering to
check until the player is ready.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Going LD while the Res is being cast.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Zoning while the Res is being cast.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Saying no because you have no idea what spell
was cast or upon which corpse (nobody contacted you ahead of time).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- Being unfortunate enough to have someone open
a trade with you (interferes with the dialog box).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- The zone repops while waiting for the Res
(all information gone).</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">My favorite of all, some well -or not so well-
intentioned cleric casting Revive upon your fresh corpse. That's right, you can
absolutely remove the possibility of a player receiving an experience res by
tossing a good old Revive upon them. There is NOTHING the recipient can do to
protect themselves against this. Nothing.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The list above is intentionally left short; I'm
sure the more imaginative among us can come up with many more examples.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In discussions about this issue on the EQ-Cleric
site some clerics pointed out that nobody was absolutely entitled to an
experience resurrection. I agree and disagree with that statement. In my opinion
it would be more accurate to state that:</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Nobody is entitled to having a level 39+
cleric Resuscitate or Resurrect them, but if a player were fortunate enough to
have one willing to do it, then they are absolutely entitled to being able to
receive it successfully with regard to the game mechanics.&quot; In other words,
if I have a cleric willing to Res me then I absolutely expect to get the
experience restoration even if I miss the dialog box through being afk,
crashing, zoning to avoid another death, or any other of the numerous
possibilities. And as a cleric who provides many resurrections every night, I
expect my recipients to always receive the experience I am willing to restore
for them, even if I forgot to warn them I am casting (it's happened), they miss
clicked (it's happened), they've gone link dead (it's happened), someone opened
a trade window with them (it's happened), they went AFK after confirming with me
(it's happened), the zone repops (it's happened), or any other conceivable
reason.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The solution to this is simple, although the
programming may not be.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- A player is eligible to receive an experience
resurrection no matter how many times they click NO (or do nothing) until they
either click YES, or their 2 hour time limit is expired.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- If a zone repops please save the information
required to provide the resurrection. I'm sure it's doable, albeit possibly
difficult.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">- If a player goes linkdead AFTER clicking YES,
either provide the experience anyway, or if that's not possible then allow them
to still be eligible upon their return to the game.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I agree with many who have stated before that
NOBODY is 100% entitle to an experience resurrection from another player. I've
said no so many times that I made a macro for it =P. However, if two players are
willing to complete the transaction (a cleric and the recipient) then the game
mechanics should be designed to ensure that the experience should be properly
returned, regardless of the game/real life problems (e.g. ISP failure) that
frequently occur. Furthermore, now that this issue is widely known, I must admit
to being somewhat concerned about the possibility of malicious Clerics casting
Revive upon people.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I fail to see how EverQuest is enhanced by
allowing the situation to remain status quo.</font></p>
<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">We've reopened this issue and are
looking into the requested design change. Initially, some possible UI changes
suggested looked optimistic, however we need to investigate the issue further
before committing to a solution.</font>

<br>
Patch Day<br>
<br>
Greetings! The live servers have been updated to reflect the newest data on the Test Server:<br>
<br>
General<br>
<br>
- Some new spells are available for the hybrid classes.  Check your Kunark spell vendors.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Found and corrected a problem causing people to fall to their deaths upon zoning.  The majority of these issues should no longer occur.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Corrected outstanding issues with several quests, including the Brain Bite, Shackle of Rock, and the Barnal Flamehands quest.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Increased treasure in many Kunark zones including The Emerald Jungle, Sebilis, and the Frontier Mountains.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Upon review we've increased the drop-rate of level 51+ spells in Kunark.  They should be more plentiful now.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Updated pathing information in many zones, making it easier for pets and other NPCs to get around the zones.<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
- A problem with the spell effect for the Luminary Two-Handed Sword.  Current owners of this weapon will need to contact a GM to trade their sword out for a working one.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The Gunthak Harpoon is now rentable. It will remain in your possession when you leave the game.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- A couple pieces of Blood Ember armor have been reduced in weight.</font></p>
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Reduced the weight on several Monk weapons found in Kunark.<br>
<br>
PvP Teams Servers (VZ/TZ) and Illusions<br>
<br>
Due to an outstanding bug that allowed a player to permanently mesmerize or stun opposing team members when coupled with an illusion, illusions will now automatically cancel when the person wearing the illusion casts an offensive spell upon any player-character.  Players should keep this in mind before attacking with spells in an area where their faction standing is less than desirable.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Illusions are defined as any spell that makes a character look different than they actually are.  This includes all racial illusions, as well as other illusions such as Treeform, Wolfform, and the Call of Bones series.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Risk and Reward<br>
<br>
The concept of risk and reward is very important to the game of EverQuest.  Ideally, situations that provide a greater reward should also provide substantial risk.  Over the past several weeks, we've been identifying areas in game where risk and reward are at a disparity, and making necessary adjustments.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
In most cases, those adjustments are in favor of increasing the reward for a specific action.  For example, we recently increased the experience awarded in many Kunark zones to offset the sometimes-considerable risk associated with adventuring there.  We also do this quite frequently by increasing the reward associated with a quest by enhancing the item, as we did last week with the Burning Rapier quest.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
However, in some cases there are instances where reward is far in excess of the risk involved, and we will be correcting these issues like those above as we come across them.  For example, there are many cases where a solitary and stationary outdoor creature has a "fast spawn", yielding the reward of fast experience-gain without the commensurate risk.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
Though it is not our policy to announce changes to individual NPCs, we did want to let you will see risk/reward disparities corrected over the next several weeks.<br>
<br>
PvP Teams (VZ/TZ) Character Transfers<br>
<br>
As many people playing upon the PvP-Teams servers are aware, Vallon Zek and Tallon Zek have different rules regarding looting rights from PvP combat.  Vallon Zek allows the victor to loot all coin plus one item from the fallen, whereas Tallon Zek allows only coin-loot with no right to loot items.<br>
<br>
Due to the fact that the looting rules were changed on Tallon Zek post-production, we've decided to allow characters on both servers a one-time character-move.  Registration for the move will open at 6:00pm PDT on Friday, June 9th, 2000, on both servers, and will be open through 12:00pm PDT on Monday, June 12th, 2000.  You can register for the move by executing the "/movelog yes" command during the registration window.  There is no limit to the number of people that we will allow to move between Tallon and Vallon Zek, so there is no reason to rush to enter the command.<br>
<br>
Please remember that once you register for the move, your decision can not be rescinded.  The actual character-move will take place sometime next week, at a time to be announced later.  Please keep in mind that corpses are not moved in a character-move, so we'd recommend against leaving unclaimed corpses around after Monday of next week if you've asked to be moved.&nbsp;<br>
<br>

<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hello
all,<br>
<br>
There are a few issues that are on the boards in multiple threads, so I thought
I'd address them in one post:<br>
<br>
TZ/VZ Moves<br>
<br>
We'll be opening the <font color="#FFFFFF"> /movelog</font> command on TZ and VZ this Friday and leaving it
open through Monday for move mid next week between those two servers. Specific's
will be posted in the patch message tomorrow morning. If you can point out any
issues that you think should be covered in the patch, please follow up in this
thread.<br>
<br>
In regards to possible moves or looting changes for RZ, none are planed or
likely. RZ was created at a different time than the two other servers, and has
maintained its ruleset since release. Though we tried out the loot idea on TZ,
our desire is to keep Rallos as it is at present.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Shrink Potion<br>
</font><br>
We'll be giving the shrink potion (created via alchemy) the ability to shrink
the user anywhere in the near future. It will be announced in the patch message
when it goes in. I can't say for certain whether this will be tomorrow or
whether it will be held off until the next item patch at the moment.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Spell Drop Rates<br>
</font><br>
We'll be increasing them, but do want to maintain a rate at which they are still
desired drops, and not loot that you just destroy because it's taking up space
in your backpack.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Alchemy Prices<br>
</font><br>
We'll be adjusting these, making it alchemy less expensive. It won't be in
tomorrows patch, but probably in the one after that.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Poison<br>
</font><br>
Still looking good for an end-of-June implementation.<br>
<br>
<font color="#FFFFFF">Clipping Plane<br>
</font><br>
Several months ago some people complained that they were no longer able to
adjust the clipping plane out as far as they had been. We've gone through all of
the zone headers and put the &quot;Maximum Clip&quot; out as far as the data
export would allow. This is already live and we've been unable to find any
problems.<br>
