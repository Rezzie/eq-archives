<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of the ancient trolls and the Dragon Trakanon</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The present day kingdom of Grobb has always been fairly secretive about
it's heritage, but common trollish lore tells us that the kingdom has it's roots
in the blasted continent of Kunark, a land of venomous rivers, gray wastes, and
seething deadwood forests. It is written that here, nestled on the banks of the
Murkdweller river, Innoruk chose to taint the bodies of man with cruel magics in
his attempt at further having a hold on the prophecied surge of human power in
the third age. But with the advent of the war of the broken crown, sages tell
that Innoruk eventually forgot about his trollish abominations and left them to
die on Kunark. What followed for the trolls was decades of brutal combat as they
struggled for the scarce natural resources of their dead continent.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It was at this time that the ancient dragon Trakanon took notice of the
slowly dying race. To call the ancient one a dragon is purely speculative, as no
one has ever seen the terrible beast many think is reponsible for the present
condition of Kunark, but the garbled texts of the trolls describe him as one.
The dragon is said to have gathered the entire population of Kunark onto one
island in the broken teeth chain and there offer the trolls a pact: Trakanon
would supply the forgotten children of Innoruk with food and water from his
personal jungle lands if they would become his servants. The trolls agreed,
regarding Trakanon as a powerful savior, king, and god. Trakanon organized the
trolls into separate tribes each to occupy a certain part of eastern Kunark so
he could control them better. It was at this time his servants adopted the name
&quot;troll&quot; which is a shortened form of the phrase &quot;troll quel'dom
gik Trakanon&quot; which meant &quot;the green children of Trakanon&quot; in
dragonish.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of Trakanon's seclusion and the Wars of The Seven
Tribes</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It has never been in the power of either man or troll to determine the
great dragon's reason for his abandonement, but we can't hope to understand the
ways of the immortals. Every text simply states that Trakanon may have just
changed his mind. Nevertheless, after centuries of relative peace and harsh rule
under their godlike king, the twenty-five tribes of Trakanon entered the second
age with their food supply dwindling and shipments coming in less and less
frequently. At first there was no panic, the tribal leaders sent messengers to
their king to ask forgiveness for whatever they had done wrong, but the
messengers started to come back with word that they had been denied an audience
with the great dragon. Trollish caravans by the hundreds started to crowd the
dark hills of disdain, waiting for the gates to open into Trakanon's hidden
kingdom, but that day never came. When word of Trakanon's seclusion started
spreading throughout Kunark, each tribe began to move closer and closer to the
east where food had once come through. They arrived next to Trakanon's kingdom
only to learn that the great dragon king had not been seen for more then 50
years and just recently had closed his gates to all messengers and caravans. The
trolls were confused, distraught, and starving, and so they waited in the Kunark
east for some word to come from their god.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When that word never came, the tribes of Trakanon started to grow
restless. Battles started to erupt haphazardly and tribal villages were attacked
and plundered. In the shadows of the mountain range &quot;Trakanon's teeth&quot;
a new trollish war erupted. The 25 tribes of Trakanon attacked eachother
viciously for food and water, and for ten years they battled nonstop until only
7 tribes were left. These 7 tribes retreated to every corner around what is now
called the field of bone, named for the countless trollish skeletons which cover
the ground. For centuries more the surviving trolls would fight what has been
called the war of the seven tribes in their attempts at stealing whatever they
could for food and drink, even the flesh and blood of other tribal members.
Trollish shamans say that every day while the war raged beneath him, Trakanon
sat perched high above his jungle throne, watching his trolls die with a grin on
his face. The war would almost cause the complete destruction of the troll race.</font>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of Chief Nalikor and the end of the Tribal Wars</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the middle of the third age, the tribes of Trakanon were all but
completely destroyed. The wars had continued for a century or more and when the
seven tribes began to finally die out, mostly from starvation and disease, the
trolls moved completely to the north of the field of bone and away from the
swamp of no hope, the spot of their creation, forever. There the starving tribe
of chief Kateera and the desperate followers of chief Nalikor squared off in one
final confrontation. Across the northern shores of Kunark raged a battle so
terrible elven bards dare sing of it only in the dark hours of the night. Troll
was pitted against troll in the end of a war that would prove what tribe would
rule Kunark, and each tribe fought with the single goal of completely destroying
the other. Slowly, the two tribes began to die. Trolls began to consume the
flesh of slain enemies, as was the accepted custom of the tribe wars, but also
the flesh of fallen comrades. In fits of madness, trollish warriors would attack
their own tribesmen and then commit suicide. The fights degenerated into scenes
of utter insanity as trollish warriors started attacking anyone around them,
friend or foe, to eat whatever they killed and to steal whatever they could
grab.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The two most unaffected by the insanity around them, being veterans of the
tribe wars themselves, were the two chiefs: Kateera and Nalikor. Realizing that
the battle they had begun would be the beginning of the end of the troll race,
both leaders met face to face with a host of their most trusted warriors on what
is named Nalikor's Mound by the ancient trollish texts with the simple intent of
ending the war once and for all. Every text says Kateera was the one who issued
the challenge, and some troll shamans describe Kateera as a foolish, rash young
leader who could have never stood a chance against the older Nalikor. Others,
however, say that Nalikor and Kateera entered in on an understanding that in
order for the trolls to stop the war the young leader had to die. Either way,
while the rest of the trollish camps settled down from the war if only for a
brief rest under a new moon, the young chief Kateera was run through and
beheaded by the old Nalikor. Rather then carry out trollish customs and consume
the bodies of his enemies, Nalikor only took Kateera's head as proof of his
victory, then buried the young chief and his fallen guards on top of the highest
hill in the field of bone, the one most stained with blood. Here the old chief
stacked the weapons of warriors that had been dead for centuries and the place
was called Nalikor's Mound, a monument to the old tribes of Trakanon and the
mark of a new age for the troll race. No one has reportedly seen the mound, but
the texts speak of it as a horrible site: a small red mountain with spears and
swords thrust through it, surrounded on all sides by the endless troll-skeletons
which cover the field of bone. At it's top Nalikor set Kateera's severed head,
grinning as it hung from a metal pike.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of Trakanon's chosen and the Fleet of Bone</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The tribe of the now defeated Kateera surprisingly did not put up much of
a resistance when they were told about the death of their leader and their loss
in the war. For a week, the survivors of both tribes rejoiced in the end of
centuries of warfare, feasting and dancing over the corpses of the dead, but
many questions still remained unanswered and many problems were left unsolved.
For decades troll shamans had prophecied that the tribe to win the wars would be
given unimaginable riches and power by their dragon lord, but Trakanon never
revealed himself to the last tribe even after the war was over. Kunark was now
completely a blasted land and a graveyard. All the creatures were dead and the
undrinkable rivers were red with blood. The tribe of Nalikor thought themselves
the sole rulers of their continent, but their continent was left with nothing
they could use to survive. When tensions started to rise again among members of
the same tribe, Nalikor realized that his followers were ready once more to
destroy themselves. Powerless and desperate, the old chief then decided to
commit an act of trollish blasphemy: he would cross Trakanon's Teeth, steal his
way into the jungle kingdom of the great dragon, and speak to the king of the
trolls personally.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Many different stories are written about the month-long journey of Nalikor
into the forbidden territory of his once-god Trakanon, but all have these few
things in common: It is said that the old chief did actually meet the great
dragon and that he told Trakanon all but one of the tribes had been killed. The
ancient beast obviously admired the chief, as he awarded Nalikor with a magic
blade and a key into his eternal kingdom, but the dragon also told Nalikor
bluntly that he would give no aid to the trolls. It was then that Trakanon told
Nalikor of the other continents and the other races, and that the chief could
either lead his people away from Kunark or watch the last tribe die. Nalikor was
especially outraged at the mention of more fruitful continents and the elder
races, and it is speculated that the hostility trolls have towards all other
Norrathians is spawned from this scorned jealousy, like a grown man emerging
from a troubled childhood. When Nalikor returned to his tribe he found it in
chaos, split among five different leaders each with different plans for Kunark.
The old chief killed each would-be-leader quickly, his flaming sword easily
cutting them down, and when word of Nalikor's new-found power spread the trolls
once more united behind him and gave him the title &quot;Trakanon's
chosen.&quot;</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The old chief told all four hundred of his remaining followers what
Trakanon had told him, and quickly began to lay out the plan for an escape off
their island-continent. With a very limited supply of natural resources, Nalikor
and his men built a fleet of five massive ships entirely out of wood, steel, and
the bones of dead trolls. With nothing left on Kunark, the trolls gladly boarded
the fleet of bone, leaving behind them their entire culture of war and death,
and sailed aimlessly for many weeks until coming to the broken skull rock off
Antonica, in the middle of the gulf of Gunthak.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Of the Ogre attacks and the treaty of the Burning
Blade</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Even before they had landed, the ogres of Oggok knew of the formidable and
ivory ships sailing for their borders. Thinking they had something to fear from
the mysterious troll fleet, which was landing next to the weakest part in the
natural defense of Oggok, the ogres immediately gathered a large force of
warriors to stop the trolls from advancing. To their complete surprise, the
ogres found the strange trolls to almost be their exact equals in combat and the
warriors were turned back by the massive tribe of Nalikor. Over the next few
days, the ogres would continue their attacks on Nalikor's tribe. The fierce
troll warriors, still homeless and starving, were able to fight off the ogres
many more times but were only barely keeping Oggok at bay. The Greenblood river
is named for the many trolls who died in it's waters as a result of ogre raids.
Nalikor, not fully understanding the ogre race or these recent skurmishes, sent
word of a treaty to Oggok. To the surprise of all the other races, king Gharn,
the eighth warlord of the ogres, whole-heartedly agreed.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The ogres and trolls shared a mutual respect, as much a respect as members
of those two races can possibly produce. The ogres saw the trolls as merciless
warriors with strange powers, but with a harsh and warlike attitude the ogres
found pleasing. The trolls, also, respected the strength and kill-or-be-killed
ways of the ogre kingdom. Soon the two races found themselves fast allies. On
the very place where Nalikor and his followers first landed, broken skull rock,
the ogres and trolls signed an agreement that neither force would attack the
other. Instead, the ogres would help the trolls establish a kingdom and routes
of supplies on Antonica in exchange for troll military support and magical aid.
To seal the kinship between ogre and troll, Nalikor gave his own magical blade
as part of the arrangement. The sword is still kept on broken skull rock in that
same secret meeting place, encased in a magical field of crystal. On it's
surface is etched &quot;Here the great alliance was formed between king Gharn
the slayer and Trakanon's chosen. May death come to those who seek to disrupt
it.&quot; Thus the alliance was called the treaty of the burning blade.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With the aid of the ogres, out of the ashes of the last tribe of Trakanon
sprang forth a new kingdom for the trolls. Nalikor chose the edges of the
Innothule Swamp for the trolls to live, which most closely resembled the place
of their creation: the swamp of no hope on Kunark. The ogres taught the trolls
how to hunt in their new land and how to build fortifications. Nalikor himself
was deeply involved in creating the new hierarchy of the troll kingdom and
ending the old tribal system of Trakanon, but he died before he could completely
achieve his goal. His death resulted in many days of troll mourning, and the
burial site of Trakanon's chosen was made the foundation of the new troll city
of Grobb- named for Nalikor's successor and the first official king of the
trolls. It is said that somewhere deep inside the temple depths of Grobb the
trollish shamans still keep watch over Nalikor's key: the only remaining link
between the trolls and the ancient kingdom of the dragon Trakanon.</font></p>
