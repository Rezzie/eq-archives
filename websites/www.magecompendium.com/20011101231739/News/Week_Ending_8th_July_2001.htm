<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hi all,</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, you've probably heard that
we're seriously considering an 'RP' server. In the past we've shy’d away from
launching one for the following reasons:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. It's very difficult to get a
large group of people to agree on what 'role playing' really means, much less
'role playing rules' that would be applied to an EverQuest server.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. Whatever ruleset we decided
upon, who knows if people would like it and play there? It's risky to launch
such an experimental server.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. EverQuest IS an Role Playing
Game anyway, so in that sense, ALL servers are RP servers.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, some things have changed.
Let me address the three previous issues we've had with an RP server:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">1. This certainly remains true,
but, well, to be brutally honest: too bad We're going to choose some rules,
listen to feedback, perhaps make some changes, and launch an RP server. Some
players will object, and argue, and debate, and, well, we're going forward
anyway. It's either a. we subjectively come up with some rules that some or many
might disagree with or b. we don't do an RP server at all. I prefer ‘a’</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">2. You may have noticed Sullon
Zek. It has some pretty experimental, wild and crazy rules and ideas as well.
This is what's pretty cool: EQ is so big now (400,000+ active subscribers) with
so many servers that we can launch some experimental ones. Back in the day when
we had 7 or 10 or 15... well, it wouldn't have been prudent. But now, we're
going for it</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">3. This remains true, and to be
honest with you, I don't know if I personally like calling this server the 'RP'
server. To me it's more like the Siege Perilous server that UO had. Maybe it's
the 'hard core' server, or the 'extreme' server... *shrug* But anyway,
regardless of what it's called, I'm very excited about the ideas and rules
behind it.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Which brings us to this: I'm going
to post our initial thoughts on what the rules will be. Now here's where the BIG
disclaimer comes in: we are posting these for feedback and ideas from you, but
they are NOT SET IN STONE. They are VERY subject to change. Heck, expect them to
change.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Disclaimer #2: I do NOT have a
date as to when we'll launch this server. It may be the next server we launch,
or the one after that. We're not sure yet. Please don't bombard us with 'when'
questions, because we won't be able to answer them.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Anyways, here are our fairly solid
but not final ideas:</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">1) Each race/class combination
will be assigned an alignment, either Good, Neutral or Evil. A high elven
paladin of Tunare will be good (as will a dwarven paladin of Brell, probably), a
dark elven warrior of Innoruuk will be evil. This will be a subjective list, so
let's not debate yet whether a dark elven rogue of Bristlebane will be neutral
or evil. The idea is that eventually each combo will have an alignment. Evils
can't group with goods, nor can they heal or buff each other (specific details,
such as summoning corpse to be determined). Neutrals will be able to work for
either side, and can be healed and buffed by either (Maybe).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">2) Common Tongue becomes Human
Tongue. This in combination with #3</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">3) Use of languages will be made
more difficult. This will include the removal of the Common Tongue. It will
include some sort of restriction on the ability to increase language skills (on
a per level or per day basis, most likely). The goal is that trolls will have to
expend their time and efforts if they want to deal with humans (and vice versa).
The removal of Dark Speech might be necessary here.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">4) One character per account.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">5) /ooc will be removed.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">6) /auction will use languages and
will be restricted to city zones.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">7) /shout will have a reduced
range.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">8) /emote will be changed such
that one has to understand the language of the emoter (lest the command simply
be used to bypass language barriers).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">9) Guild membership will be
restricted so that goods and evils can't be members of the same guild.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">10) /who list will show everyone
as 'anonymous'.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">11) 'Warrens' loot code turned on
for ALL zones.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">12) This is a PvE server, NOT a
PvP server.</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us know what you think (via
the normal feedback, not Ask Brad).</font>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">thanks,</font>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There
have been three major reasons we've not accomodated server moves before:<br>
<br>
1. We were concerned that it would upset the economies on the destination server<br>
<br>
2. We lacked the manpower to accomdate the moves.<br>
<br>
3. We were afraid one server might be perceived as 'better' or more 'popular'
and that players would flock there.<br>
<br>
We've now addressed these three issues:<br>
<br>
1. You move without items, and the cost is somewhat prohibitive. In other words,
players will hopefully move for the right reasons now, and being sans items
shouldn't measurably disturb the destination server's economy.<br>
<br>
2. We've updated our billing system and automated much of the task, such that
the manpower hit is minimal.<br>
<br>
3. We're pretty sure we have enough servers now (which wasn't the case in the
past) such that this won't happen. That said, if it does happen (or if anything
'bad' happens because of this), I assure you it will be turned off ASAP.<br>
<br>
Therefore, I must respectfully disagree with Shadoe's assertion that we are
'selling out' in any way and/or abandoning our principles.<br>

fixed the way that NPCs were treating pets. They were accrediting more hate to
pets than they should have.&quot;<br>
<br>
I still don't think its fixed :)<br>
<br>
Saturday we had a day long raid in Kael, arena area.. during that day our tanks
could not get mobs off my pets no matter what they did. Even if I repeatedly hit
pet back off and the warrior was attacking and taunting like mad, it still hit
my pet.<br>
<br>
Now, I agree, before pets were building zero aggro, and this was a problem, but
now they are out-aggroing 59th level warriors! (and these are only the 54th
level summons (so a 41-45th level pet)<br>
<br>
It seems that the aggro is still out of balance, could you look into it again ?<br>

We're still looking at this. It seems that the fix might not have been complete.
I certainly noticed that it was much better after the patch, but there may still
be a few bugs in it. Keep in mind, though, that there is no promise that we will
or even want to return things to exactly the way they were regarding pets. As
you say, zero aggro for pets isn't really in the plan either.<br>
