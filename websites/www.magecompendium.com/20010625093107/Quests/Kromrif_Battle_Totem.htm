Svekk has several different supply deliveries that he will assign you. Each of
these quests branches differently. The one described here will result in the Kromrif
Battle Totem.<br>
<br>
Ask Svekk about the Great Divide and he will tell you that they are badly in
need of supplies but have not paid for them. He can give you the supplies if you
want to front the money. This will cost you 50pp. He will then give you a bag of
supplies to deliver.<br>
<br>
These supplies must be delivered to an NPC in the giant fort just to the left
upon entering the <b><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/greatdivide.html" target="Main"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">The
Great Divide</font></span></a></b>. This NPC is not in the main building but can be found inside on the
side closest to the zone to East Wastes.<br>
<br>
Giving him supplies will result in him handing you a letter to return to Svekk.
It appears they are still in need of more supplies.<br>
<br>
Return the letter to Svekk and he will inform you that he does not have one of
the supplies requested. He needs a Klezendian Crystal which can be found in the <b><a href="http://www.eqatlas.com/velious/crystalcaverns.html"><span style="background-color: #000000"><font face="Verdana" size="2" color="#FFFFFF">Crystal
Caverns</font></span></a></b>. He will send you to obtain it and give you a voucher to return to
him after finding the crystal.<br>
<br>
The crystal random drops on mobs there so it should not be hard to find. Return
it and the voucher to Svekk and he will give you a new bag of supplies to take
to Great Divide. Taking these supplies there you will be rewarded with a Kromrif
Battle Totem.</font></p>
