Patch Day<br>
<br>
Greetings all!  The following changes have been implemented on the Live servers:<br>
<br>
Spells/Songs<br>
<br>
- Voltaic Draught, a high level wizard direct damage spell was improperly saving versus resistance to cold.  It now appropriately saves versus magic.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- The higher level bard song by Brusco was improperly healing the target instead of damaging it.  This has been corrected.<br>
<br>
Items<br>
<br>
The Shadowknight class-specific quest armor, Darkforge armor, has had its weight decreased substantially.<br>
<br>
The Runed Fighter's Staff, previously useable by Monks and Warriors, has been restricted to Monks only.  The statistics on this staff are much more powerful than normally allowed for warriors.  This change is retroactive and will be reflected on items currently in inventory.  Though we strive to avoid negatively adjusting items after they have been earned, this item presented a balance issue, making the change necessary.  We apologize to warriors that currently own this weapon.<br>
<br>
A data error with the Symphonic Saber, causing it to report "Item out of charges", has been corrected.  Due to the dynamics of this particular issue, current owners will need to contact a GM to trade this item out for a new, properly working version of the item.<br>
<br>
The Burning Rapier (rogue weapon) has been enhanced.  In addition to an increase in statistics, it received a stronger spell effect.  The lightsource effect on the weapon has been removed due to an aesthetic rogue desire to be "sneaky" :)<br>
<br>
The effect on the Hangman's Noose will now work properly.<br>
<br>
General Changes<br>
<br>
- Some NPCs in Dalnir were casting spells much too powerful for their level.  They have been adjusted.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Pathing information has been updated in Highkeep.  NPCs and pets should have a much easier time of navigating the zone.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Some Quest-NPCs were not spawning properly in Rathe Mountains. These issues have been corrected.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- A handful of problems reported with research practice via the Concordance of Research have been corrected.  All practice-rune recipes should now work correctly.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Gorilla's in Burning Wood now have a new texture set that properly reflects their undead status.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Fishing should now work properly in Kunark zones.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- /yell now reports the proper direction to people hearing the yell.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Corrected a bug that gave some races the impression that they were allowed to start their character in Cabalis.  They were
ever actually allowed to create the character there, however the indication that they could has been fixed.</font></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><br>
- Corrected sound issues that were causing some crashes to the desktop in certain cases.<br>
<br>
We are in the process of patching music files (*.XMI) for zones in which music does not currently work.  There are 55 small files (around 2K each) that will be patched over the next couple of days to enable music in all of the affected zones.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
The zone of Timorous Deep has been tuned and itemized.  Certain aspects of the changes have made certain areas of the zone more dangerous, but the reward should be well worth the risk.  Feel free to visit this zone and search out its treasures at your leisure. Note: These changes went in on Monday.<br>
<br>
Upon investigation, we discovered a deficiency with the amount of experience being rewarded in many Kunark zones (mostly dungeons).  The affected zones have been updated, and adventurers should notice the greater experience reward in return for the increased risk and challenge associated with these zones.<br>

<font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Recently, I have hit level 54 in
EverQuest, I have seen my friends struggle though this level, and a few of them
stop playing for days at a time, and now I can see why.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">Day after day I logon, find a
group and watch my exp crawl. I sit in a spot, the puller runs off and pulls, as
a caster, the loot in ROK is next to non-existent, and the spells are more rare
then the fiery avenger in my guild (we have about 4, and 3 nag books, only if
vox would cough them up now), and each day I logoff with my exp bar being like
half a pixel ahead from where I started.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">During the week days, I often
don't have the time to attend &quot;raids&quot; on dungeons where we dive down
and explore them, I usually just have time to find groups within my guild
attempting to gain exp, and day after day, my exp bar just crawls along.</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">A friend of mine, who roughed
it though level 54, got 2 bubbles in 24 hours of /played. ~12 hours per bubble,
I get to play for about 4-5 hours per day. It would take me 2 days and a bit to
get a full bubble, that is if I don't die, and that is if I get into a group
ASAP or solo, so it'd be more like 3-4 days per bubble, that is getting a tad
harsh. 4 days * 5 bubbles = 20 days, almost a month for a level, that is if I do
non-stop power gaming with now &quot;hiccups&quot;, (deaths/bad groups/etc).</font>
<p><font color="#FFFFFF" size="2" face="Verdana">So I spend days on end, to make
little advancement, only get a chance to explore on weekends (which usually
results in a death or two), to see NO loot that I can use, to obtain NO spells
which can help define my class, just to get to level 55, in which I get no
&quot;upgrades&quot; in my power, then I need to do level 55 and 56, before I
get any relative upgrade in power at level 57, just to get a slap in the face
pet at level 59, and then 59 is a lot worse then 54, so I'd guestimate at east a
month or a month and a half, to get to level 60, and get the spells that really
give me a boost in power?</font>

*hugs and kiss's*</font></p>
<font size="2" face="Verdana">There's something that I'm wondering about while
reading this thread, and I hope everyone here can help me understand the issues
that are at work.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When the characters were 50th level, and 50th
was the cap, players accepted the fact that they weren't gaining levels and
proceeded across the world to adventure and have fun.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Now that we've raised the cap to 60, people can
once again gain experience, levels, etc. Why &quot;struggle&quot; through
levels? Why not simply play the game as you were at 50th and let whatever
happens, happen? Since you can gain levels, you'll certainly gain them faster
than you did when you were 50th and capped.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I get the impression that there are a number of
people who want to &quot;hurry up and get to 60th so they can relax and have
fun&quot;. Though there might be some worry of being out leveled by your
friends, no longer being able to group, that concern doesn't exist from 50th to
60th.</font>

</font><font size="2" face="Verdana" color="#C0C0C0"><br>
The LORE and NODROP tags on items have different effects on the player economy
and the farming issue.<br>
<br>
For instance, NODROP, though created for the purpose of making people complete
their own quests, is *very good* at controlling the farming problem. However
it's very bad for the player economy, and actually promotes camping, or gives
people the feeling that they are required to camp. It also makes things such as
looting a persons corpse for them when it's in a bad place impossible.<br>
<br>
LORE, though not as good as NODROP at stopping farming still does does
something, making it a bit cumbersome for one character to hold a bunch of items
on their own. It's easier on the player economy than NODROP, but still presents
some game play problems. It also gives people the feeling that they are required
to camp because people are less likely to want to trade LORE items since they
they have to go back and get another one for themselves.<br>
<br>
Though the absence of both of these tags does present some farming issues, it is
by far the best for the player economy, general game play, and gives people
another reasonable option to acquire something besides camping it themselves.
With the implementation of the play-nice policies, as well as the addition of
all of the new zones with the expansion, the farming issues are being handled
through other means.<br>
<br>
So, to answer your question, we don't want to place the LORE and NODROP tags on
items as a matter of course, and would prefer to give each item and situation
some serious thought due to the negative consequences of these tags.<br>

I don't know off the top of my head if this still happens in PvP situations
(/duel, guildwar, etc.) on non-PvP servers, but it has been correct on the PvP
servers. The exception to this is cases where owner of the pet is LD or under
the effect of Fear (cast by an NPC since PCs can fear each other any longer). As
with the issues above, addressing these exceptions is not feasible, and we'll
consider any cases of intentional abuse a customer-service issue.</font></font></p>

Please, do not use any software that you aren't absolutely sure about. Even if
they pass virus-checks, they can very well be programs that record keystrokes,
or try to trick you into giving out information about your account. It is each
players responsibility to protect themselves from these types of attacks.<br>
<br>
There are no programs that will give you GM powers, Zone faster, or let you do
anything to positively affect the status of your character in-game.<br>

<font size="2" face="Verdana">Another attempt is being made to get the passwords
from EQ users. Various persons are receiving emails about a new EQHack program
that claims it has the ability to give the powers of a GM to any character of
your choice without making the character a GM. I have a dummy account on EQ to
test out all emails I get regarding such programs and attempts to get passwords
for EQ.</font>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">This program has been confirmed to be a Trojan
Horse program that will allow the creator access to your account and then
changes the password to a preset one chosen by the creator once the chosen
character reaches level 47. DO NOT down load this program and as always, never
give your EQ password out to anyone.</font></p>

whoever tried to download a program thinking it would turn them into a GM. Also
I am dubious to the existence of this latest scam, but to be safe DON'T download
anything of the sort.</font></p>
