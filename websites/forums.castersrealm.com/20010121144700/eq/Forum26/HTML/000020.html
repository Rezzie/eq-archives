</FONT><HR>Is it just me, or do mages seem to always lose.  Every class has an advantage, Warriors can beat things in to the ground in Melee. Rangers track and have bows. Wizzies can nuke like nobodys buisness. Shammeys get buff. necros get pets AND DoT AND life taps.  Dru have ports and buffs adn soem attack power. Enchanters are big in trade skills, and they have some good buffs/debuffs.  Mages, umm well, our pets get ripped to shreds by a war, and umm a wiz can out nuke us, and a necro can par our pet, DOT us, Life Tap our pet, and leave.  umm a rouge can fear backstab backstap our pet. ANd unless we have an Earth elemental, any melee (war,mnk) or half melee (rng,ply,Sk,rouge) can just walk past our pets and kill us.  so why is it that we are not the masters of anyhting, sure our pets are good, but that does us little, once we nuke, the MoB ignore our pets.  I dunno but NO ONE has ever specificly PAID for anyhting i can summon, ever.  And most of what we summon can be toped.  Clerics pally and many classes can heal, topping our bands, rngers, iksar, and dru can forage and beat our summon food/water, ohh and that suff is no rent right? Make camp wake up the next morning and STARVE!  Summoned weapons are cool, but having to summon the pet, then the weapon, then the buffs, THEN YOU, med for an hour.  Ohh did i mention how ong our pets last aginst ward summoned spell???<P>Mages need something else, mabey making our pets VASTLY superior to other because we ARE THE PET PEOPLE!  or, if oyu don't want to have swarms of angry necros running around, why not let us summon trade skill compenents.  It makes snese, we can summon everythign else.  Why can't i summon a block of ore, some silk etc.  Not lal items no, and not complex ones either, not like metal bits for sheet metal, but the ore at least.  ANd can we invoke the elemental furry of somehting other than fire during battle plz!  MAbey drwonign someone, or freezing them, or blowign them ten feet.  Perhaps spells to summon anouther PC to us that is in our zone?  Or an NPC at that? for summing is what we do.  or perhaps summon some means of self trans port, although i agree this would hirt the wiz and dru classes a whole heck of a lot. But some thing ANY THING! so that we are not the peopel that do everything crappy like.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=26&topic=000020.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=MAges+Need+somehting+more">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Huh? What are you talking about? Lemme tell you why Mages are FINE!<P>1. We get swords of runes for our pets, making our pets not needed to be more powerful.<BR>2. Necros lose when we duel em. Our pets kick the crap outta em be4 they can even cast fear! And, Their dots can't stack with themselves. Lifetap? So? We got shielding and that phantom armor series gives us regen. Besides, we don't need much hits.<BR>3. Wizards? HAH! An air pet will interrupt all their nukes. Also we only hit 270 less than their ice comet at 49.<BR>4. Buffs? Who needs em!!! Our pets have ultra regen, phat abilities and other stuff.<BR>5. Rangers are frickin weak. And their bows aren't great. However, yer right about one thing, they can track. We can't.<BR>6. Our pets can SOLO most melee classes. Monks are the only threat, since they hit just about as hard. However, a level 50 mage and a level 50 monk duel would result in the mage winning if he was smart. Earth pet, Root, nuke nuke nuke, death. Simple. Why do you think a warrior can kill your pet? BTW, warriors have more downtime than us, so there.<BR>7. Sks also suck. They can't kill us unless there was like 3 of em. Rouge, well, heh, at 51+ our water pets can backstab em back!<BR>8. Umm, not many mobs have Ward summoned.<BR>9. Course the mob ignores yer pet! You outdamaged your pet. If your pet hits the same amount as your nuke before you nuke, then they won't come at ya.<BR>10. I don't mind the Summoning stuff. You only have to med for a minute. And we get cornucopia and everfount so we can summon stacks. Besides, foragers would probably get water when they are hungry and food when they are thirsty. So we have the advantage there. <BR>11. Our pets are already superior! Our pets are the only ones with different abilities and stuff! Example: Rhino hits fire pet. Rhino gets has butt burned for 35 points of damage. you heal fire pet. repeat till bum drops. =P<BR>12. If we could summon trade skill stuff, then the items we made would be no rent, you know. DUH!<BR>13.Drowning? Freezing? Blowing them 10 feet? Thats druid cr@p. If you want that stuff, be a druid.<BR>14.Spells to summon another pc to us that is in the zone? WE ALREADY HAVE THAT STUPID!!! We get it at 55, and it's called call of the hero.<BR>15. Self transport eh? Solution: Use the firepot room in Timorous Deep at -12260, 4360.<P>You must be a newbie, or a complete idiot to not know these things. <Sigh> Know your class well before you post.<P>Magnan Imus<BR>43 Magician of the Saryrn Server<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=26&topic=000020.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=MAges+Need+somehting+more">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Magnan,<P>Get up a few levels.  We'll see if you change your tune then.  You want a water pet?  Ok, the first post-50 water pet is at level 54.  But wait, that canonly be found on level 55+ mobs.  Think that will be easy to come by at 54?  (The honest answer is that almost no mage has it at 54.)<P>So, we get a new earth pet at 51.  That is fine.  Wish he hit a tad harder though.  Fire pet at 52?  Well I have heard of level 34 earth pets defaeting this pet in a duel.  I do have the Air pet spell for 53, and look forward to trying it (I should hit 53 a little later today.)<P>What I really want is a little creativity.  Something that is cool to look forward to at these high levels.  Maybe a different type of pet?  Necros get a Spectre, why can we get a Slim or Acid Elemental?<P>Anyway, yes the mage is great up to level 49, after that things stop getting much better.<P>-Dundus</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=26&topic=000020.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=MAges+Need+somehting+more">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>You have some good points Dundus but Magnun_Imus never once said that the mage post 50 was a bed of roses.  The post simply replied to ME!'s and to me, simply defended the mage class.

</FONT><HR>okies,  nicely put mag. i am 45th level and still learning how to play my char.  mhahah  my one and only char.  cant seem to want to play a (retches) druid or a wizzie, and my running mates have proven that my choice to be magi is well founded,  we rock.  but i do have to admit that being able to summon a different type of elemental post 50 would have been nice.  we have mastered the elements after all so why not change the 50+ pets to golem types ( at least in appearance ) that would have been cool and set the masters apart form the apprentices. my two coppers and by the by,  i like the humor aspect of the party pack we can summon (54????) but what is the bottle for?

</FONT><HR>I would have to agree with the last reply. we do tend to have many strikes against us (as mages)I have studied the Mage compared to many other classes for some time now, and I find that other classes tend to have the same spells that that mages have. Take the druid for example they have forage and summon food and water??? Seems to be somthing wrong with that, and if you notice the list of spells that a mage will get over his/her lifetime are the same??? The only difference is that over the course of leveling the spell becomes more powerful. and most of the other classes get the same spell as we do at much higher lvls. in tight places like Befallen and Black Burrow a pet can be downright dangerous to summon. We can sommon weapons and that is a nice touch but they are worthless. I think the Mage was a after thought in Verant's mind when they created the class. In my honest opinion the mage should have been the enchanter and the enchanter the mage. Mages are mysterious and powerful (almost like a Jedi) we should have got DOT spells like choke, and maybe a disarm skill, also spells that would give us a levate and sow. Why not (Druids get snare that root and does damage. This may sound crazy but we should have a special skill that will let us create Plat. Why not we have nothing else to offer Norrath. Well, I'll continue to stick with my mage be cause I have a saying that all mages should follow "play the hand your delt".   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=26&topic=000020.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=MAges+Need+somehting+more">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>hehe, well everyone seems to be pretty worked up about the ol mages.  I do not know firsthand past 45 (pushin my way through hell now - yuk) but i do know that i have just spent the last 10 lvls in OT with my fire pet pissing everybody off because I was lvling faster than any of them...way faster.  The fact is that we can outdamage wizzies, we just can't keep it up for that long, but I can't tell you how many wizzies have been pissed when I told em my spell stats.  I guess my feeling is that while me may not be these huge whoopass machines we can form a vital backbone to groups and damn if tons of people don't want my swords for their pets.  Any class can be a kick ass class if you work well with others (that means kiss enchanter ass for clarity!) and are just friendly...i have NEVER asked for money for what i summon and in return i get free kickass buffs wherever i go.  And just ask other classes if they were happy that that earth pet was there to beat the livin shiat out of that mob that was gonna kill them...be happy with your class, and if you aren't occasionaly petition asking if verant hates you...i have gotten some pretty damn funny replies to that one.  Oh, and if you are ever feeling really down just go sit at the newbie log and give out mod rods to the lowbies from other classes...bwahaha.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=26&topic=000020.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=MAges+Need+somehting+more">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

Mages have an advantage also.  Every class also has disadvantage.<P>ME: Warriors can beat things in to the ground in Melee.<P>Actually your pets seem to do as good or better damage, at least in the 40 - 55 range.

The most skilled tradesman I know is a mage.  He is the most skilled because he made it a priority.<P>I notice that you forgot to mention that druids don't exactly have the capability to do damage (direct or otherwise) in an efficient manner.<P>ME: Mages, umm well, our pets get ripped to shreds by a war,<P>At what level?

What are you going to complain about next?  Clerics being able to outheal you?<P>ME: and a necro can par our pet, DOT us, Life Tap our pet, and leave.<P>Necro pets are lots weaker than mage pets.  I've spent enough levels keeping pets alive to be aware of what kind of health each has.<P>ME: umm a rouge can fear backstab backstap our pet.<P>Earth pet roots the rogue.  Rogue fears the pet.  Pet runs out of backstab range, perhaps even before the rogue could use it.  Fear breaks.  Pet comes back and quad hits the rogue for the same amount of damage as the backstab.<P>By the way, at the levels I am familiar with, your earth pets have lots more health than rogues.<P>Not to mention, the rogue has to sit there and endure the nukes you keep throwing at him to keep him warm.<P>ME: ANd unless we have an Earth elemental, any melee (war,mnk) or half melee (rng,ply,Sk,rouge) can just walk past our pets and kill us.<P>Umm ... wouldn't that be a good reason to summon an earth elemental?<P>ME: so why is it that we are not the masters of anyhting,<P>Mages are the masters of doing lots of damage with very little downtime.  Pets may cost a bit up front, but they dish out greatly disproportionate amounts of damage over their lifetime.<P>ME: sure our pets are good,<P>Correction, your pets are the best.<P>ME: but that does us little, once we nuke, the MoB ignore our pets.<P>Because you're nuking too hard and too early in the fight.  Space your nukes out better and you won't have that problem.<P>ME: I dunno but NO ONE has ever specificly PAID for anyhting i can summon, ever.<P>I've seen people willing to pay for runeswords, arrows, food, water, bandages, levitation rings, and modulation rods.  Of course, there's probably more than that, but I'm not a mage.<P>My mage friends never complain about needing platinum.  They go farm hill giants for money.<P>ME: And most of what we summon can be toped.<P>You're right.  A waterstone can be topped by a fishbone earring (4500pp) or a rebreather (2000pp).<P>Runeswords can be topped ... if you're willing to hand two processing weapons to your pet.<P>Levitation that's not dependant on a reagent; that can be topped by a 49th level necromancer spell.<P>An 8 slot 100% weight reduction bag to carry summoned food, spare runeswords, and heavy (but not too valuable) loot in; that can be topped by the Tinkerer's Pack (5250pp).<P>ME: Clerics pally and many classes can heal, topping our bands,<P>I would really hate to think of how much you would complain if you were a healer and bandages could top your healing.<P>ME: rngers, iksar, and dru can forage and beat our summon food/water, ohh and that suff is no rent right? Make camp wake up the next morning and STARVE!<P>If mages need water, they can summon water.  If a forraging class needs water, they can forrage and hope that it's water and not fishing grubs.<P>Furthermore, you can get 20 food in one stack.  I'm lucky to forrage three foods of the same type at one time.  Usually I'll have three to five foods in two or three stacks.  It takes up twice as much space and weighs twice as much.<P>My forraging is maxxed, but I rely on milk and muffins to survive.<P>Oh, and my cleric has summoned food for himself every morning since 9th level.  There is a difference.  Instead of casting 2 spells, he casts 10 spells to get a stack of each.<P>ME: Summoned weapons are cool, but having to summon the pet, then the weapon, then the buffs, THEN YOU, med for an hour.<P>As a soloing cleric, I got to med up from zero every time I killed something.  Obviously, I didn't solo often.<P>ME: Ohh did i mention how ong our pets last aginst ward summoned spell???<P>Why is that an issue?  Are you handing Runeswords to the creatures you fight?<P>ME: Mages need something else, mabey making our pets VASTLY superior to other because we ARE THE PET PEOPLE!<P>You have a pet that does damage like a monk, takes damage like a paladin or shadow knight, regens better than a troll in a ceremonial breastplate.  On top of that, you can nuke, buff your pet, and heal your pet.  You have a choice of four different pets, so you can choose the pet that is best for the circumstances you find yourself in.  You never have to buy food, drink, bandages, or weapons for your pet.<P>Other people have recommended that you switch to a class that you'll be happy with.  Don't bother.  You'll be unhappy with every class.<P>A mage's life is not perfect.  That isn't true of any class.  However, your class is very powerful (if played well).  It is even somewhat powerful when played badly, which has the unfortunate effect of putting a fair number of lousy mages out in the population.<P>Staccato Obligato <Hand of Mana><BR>Chorister of the 31st Measure<P>Harbron Shieldwall <Promethean><BR>Vicar of the 51st Cirlce</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=26&topic=000020.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=MAges+Need+somehting+more">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I was sitting in Dreadlands the other night and had a warrior pay me 200pp for 200 arrows so she could practice archery, not bad.<P>Besides one of the posters above is right. Money ??  I paid 12k for my GEBs and made that purely from PP drops off Ice Giants.<P>It is true that mages did not receive the gross upgrades that many other classes did in the post 50 environment, such as disciplines etc, however as a mage this doesn't fuss me at all.<P>Our class is embarrassingly overpowered in the 40-50 band, only necros approach this sheer destructive potential. Remember your pet uses NPC rules for its damage capacity and output. When I was in my mid 40s I felt bad because I'd watch my single air pet outdamage the combined efforts of the two tanks in the group.<P>To my mind the mild enhancements given to mages post 50 brought them back to at least some semblance of equality with the other classes. Then again, I can solo 6 Dreadlands mobs in a row without stopping to med, how many tanks can do that ?<P>For those who complain about necros, in the final analysis there is only one necro spell that makes them rule ..... Fear.<P>DoTs, DM Floating ... all minor issues. In my mind NO pet class should have fear spells, not necros, not even enchies, Verant really doesn't seem to realise how powerful this combination is.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=26&topic=000020.cgi&ReplyNum=000021&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=MAges+Need+somehting+more">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I have been playing a magician for a year and some now, been playing the game since june of 1999. Have played a Warrior to the high 20s and a paladin to the high 20s also.  Also have played a wizard and druid but not to as high of level. Currently play a cleric when no guild stuff going on.<BR>I am a 51st magician, yes i could have been 60 by now if i was one of those powerleveling geeks, but i have mastered all trade skills except cooking and jewlry.  So YES magicians can make a decent profit from trade skills. Haveing played other classes has given me great insight on how to play a magician better, i now know the strenghts and weaknesses of most classes and am a better grouping partner now.  I beleive that the magician is a great well rounded class and that out abilities compliment other classes well. Lets say your in a long long camp for a FBSS, tanks run out of food, just summon them, or need arrows for pulling, just summon them, the ability of the magician is to make a group self sufficient, and not have to make the constant runs to the vendors or bank ect. I treat my pet as a body guard, sit him down and tanks pull, then send pet in to take any extras if we dont have a chanter or send it on the main mob ect.  Our self reliance is our strength.  From lv 1 on we never have to pay for food or drink, that is a great advantage at low levels, and saves magicians a bundle of cash.<P>Now for my gripe, Magicians are the masters of conjuration, masters of the elements, i have always felt, in my opinion, that the spells we have should have been elemental bassed, not the shock of swords line, but Fire, cold, earth, air.  Let the wizards have the magic based attacks. But do have to admit that the blades/swords line has a very low resistance rate in my opinion and i am a lv 51 magician.  I feel we need a larger variety of summoning spells, like a 2hd slasher and a lower level non lore 1hd blunt<BR>When they added the effects to the summoned staves, i felt it was a great addition, i always keep a couple summoned for the cancle magic or see invis effects they have.  When they made water stones, everyone said it was worthless, i was low 30s then and aided a KK raid by sitting up at entrance to unrest summoning waterstones, made 350 plat for 2 hours of summoning, when they made em non lore, i made a ton of plat for folks that where on KK raids, and i did not ask for the plat but they insisted.  By far, the trade skills have been the best money maker for me.<BR>I only have to say that i am very happy with the magician class and shall continue to play it, i suggest to all magicians that they start a tank character just to understand the weaknesses and strengths and thus make themselves better magician players.<P>Respectfully<BR>Wayshaper Mysticweaver<BR>51st Elementilist</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=26&topic=000020.cgi&ReplyNum=000022&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=MAges+Need+somehting+more">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Gee, after some of these excellent posts I don't know how much I can add.<BR>1. NO class is perfect--get used to it.<BR>2. Mages can outdamage any other class in the  game over time--with the exception of necro DoTs.<BR>3. Mage pets use NPC calculators for power. A 50+ pet (fire is a bit different) can almost always solo any tank it wants to. Without you ever casting anything on it. Fire is different because 50+ flames take a reduction in hp and power in exchange for high 30-ish wizzie spells. Dispell magic, the force shock line, a flame dd, stuff like that. Kick's ass against PC's, not so good against MoB's. Fairly useful in groups, sometimes.<BR>4. Mage DD is not terribly inferior to that of wizards at high levels, and nothing else comes close. The allways-mentioned IC only does about 300 damage more than the most powerful mage dd spell, which I believe is lava bolt. This is pre-50+, mind you. After that, the gap widens a bit. Not too much, but enough. Necros, again, can outdamage with DoT's, but in a group setting quick damage is usually more useful.<BR>5. Mage summoned stuff is nice. Sword of runes? Goodbye Mob elemental. People will PAY for this stuff. Mana for money is almost never a bad thing. 20 food? you got it. 20 water? cool. Proc'ing weapons? Coming right up. Levitation? Water breathing? Ultravision and AC? Mages got all o' dat. The weapons won't be as good as what tanks will have by then, but your pet will use them happily.<BR>6. Did I mention that mage pets are the best in the game, with absolutely no room for argument? Deal with their insane superiority. Mages are really one of only three classes that can effectively solo past about 35 or so. (the other 2, druid and necro, of course). Plus, you get options. Each pet is good for different stuff, so you can tailor your style to the type of MoB you are up against.<BR>7. What else needs to be said? Mages are not a perfect class. They are, however, a very good class that is easy enough to learn, but very hard to master. They are utility, massive damage, and built-in tank all at once. A good high-level magician can probably solo almost any other PC. Wizzies? Bah. IC takes 7 secs to cast--air elemental stuns go off every six. Do the math. Necros? Tougher, but hey--you whale on it god enough, it'll never get fear off anyway. You'll kill him before his dots kill you, at least. Druids? Cast velocity on your pet--that'll stop the cowardly bastards from kiting your poor pet around--now it'll run as fast as the poor stupid druid. Then go kill it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=26&topic=000020.cgi&ReplyNum=000023&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=MAges+Need+somehting+more">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>RE: But do have to admit that the blades/swords line has a very low resistance rate in my opinion and i am a lv 51 magician. <P>I learned this, as soon as I got the first in the line, and understand the why of it as well. So for those younger mages and other classes who don't understand it, I'll explain the why.<P>Our shock line, as well as the Necro's Life Tap line, are magic based damage. Therefore only the target's magic resist can effect it. However, the other lines, such as flame bolt and shock of flames, are based on heat and magic. So the combined effect of heat resistance and magic resistance effect our spell's chance of being resisted. <P>On a side note. I heard Necros complaining a lot about their spells being resisted. All the while their life taps rarely are. The life tap used to be unresistable.<P><BR>As for improvements to the mage, and other caster classes. The only thing I would love to see added is the ability to cast while running. Not at low levels mind you. To keep this fairly balanced it could be made such that we'd need a very high Chanelling skill, Dex and Agi to do this. Expamle, 100+ Dex 100+ Agi and 150+ Channeling. We'd still have the chance to be interupted, but we would also have the change for a "You reaing your concentration and continue casting."As our Chenneling skill grew higher we'd be able to pull off a cast while running more often. But even at maxed skill it'd still be no better than 50% or even 75% chance.<P>While, we don't really need this ability, it would be a nice to have for escape situations where your pet died(in the case of us mages) or you root didn't hold (in the case of those classes with the spell) and we needed to gate out. But then some heads up and you'll be running away or gating out before it gets bad enough to need this. <P>Example: I had my new mage (lvl 18) out in Lake of Ill Omen yesterday soloing the Iskar bandits at spot 4 on the EQ Atlas map of the zone. If I got one ot two I was fine. But after getting killed the first time I pulled 3 (one was a Maurader) I quickly learned to save myself by gating out before the pet could be killed. Sure, I knew this before as it's my 2nd mage, but after not playing for 8 months I forget a lot of things.<P>Monthar Kragan lvl 31 Human Mage SolRo<BR>Montharian lvl 18 Erudite Mage SolRo<P>PS. The reason for 2 on the same server is back when the server was new and I created the 1st one I did the stupid newbie trick of putting most of my points to stamina thinking I'd live longer and being a mage I wouldn't need as much mana. By lvl 31 even with +30 from int items, that base 90 int (120 total) was not a big enough mana pool to effectively solo. Approx 800 mana total. The new, inprove, Erudite starting with 142 base int and the Items from Monthar, plus a few new ones giving a 182 total (+40 from items) and a couple plus mana items, has just over 700 mana in his pool already and he's only lvl 18.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=26&topic=000020.cgi&ReplyNum=000024&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=MAges+Need+somehting+more">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum26/HTML/000020-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum26/HTML/000020-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum26&number=26&thisthread=000020&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum26&number=26&thisthread=000020&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
