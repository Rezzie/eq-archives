</FONT><HR>Okay, the problem I'm having and what I think is completely unfair is that it seems that shamans end up getting the worst spells in the kunark expansion and velious expansion.  On top of that shaman's have the problem of obtaining 200 wisdom compared to the other classes and we don't get the uber items like the clerics get like the +20 wis gloves in chardok or shaman only good items compared to other classes.  I was hoping in kunark that we might possibly get a good pet but do we get a good one at all?  At 55 I have to look forward to a pet that is almost 20 levels lower than myself and isn't anywhere as good as the other classes and then sk's get a pet that is almost as good as ours and they're a hybrid.  I was hoping maybe we might get a bear pet or werewolf pet something to show accomplishment than a lame animal that is almost a waste of time.  Also, we don't get another dot until level 56 and I admit we have 2 good dots at 49 but in comparing to necromancers they get splurt at 51 and continue to get good spells compared to us.  <P>What do we have to look forward in Velious?  Bear form???  That's more of a novelty than anything else because most likely by the time you're at that level you have 200 wis and it's more for humor value than anything.  I'm about to get 54 and when I do my new dd which is ice based is almost worthless in Velious and we now get poison dd's that are not as good and get new aoe rain spells that are never used.  The one spell I was looking forward to I heard was taken out of the game the shaman level 19 spell growth as that would have been fun to cast on our pets but alas that has been removed from what I've heard.<P>I love my shaman and is my favorite character overall to play but I would hope for something nice in the next expansion spell wise or just some nice shaman only items but so far have only come across some nice spears and nothing else.  All I'm asking is that we get some consideration when you decide to make items with ungodly amounts of wisdom like the cleric seems to get hooked up on the most when they don't even need it as they're the easiest wisdom class to reach 200.  <P>I know there are others that feel the same as I do and I'm not saying our spells are worthless but better consideration should have been made as the only spell that makes us so useful at the later levels is our slow spell and our buffs.  I could argue that we our spiritual people who are one with the woods and should have forage and tracking but that argument has been addressed.<P>Oh well, this is my gripe at least and am just wanting to have feedback from other people with their opinion on this matter.<P>------------------<BR>Slaiyn Murdoch<BR>53 Shaman Mystic<BR>Bristlebane Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I agree totally with you bro on this one.  I personally think shamans have gotten the shaft when it comes to the exspansion's.  Just look at the Necro's spells after 50+ i counted 10 really nice dots life tap or life tap dots and one nice nuke for a necro and a couple kick ass pets that backstab.  and these 50+ spells the necros get arent this garbage rain spells that no one use's or area effect they are just plain kick ass.  then you look at the Druid spells at 50+ they get 4 or 5 nice nukes and 2 really nice dots. then you look at us Shamans we get 2 deicent dots and one nuke that are offensive. ohh and we get those 2 **** spells with rain and area effect at 50+ and a pet that would prob have a hard time killing are lvl 49 pet.  Shaman's even the shaft even when it comes to the group buffs we get crap like group poison or disease and druids get group regrowth and such.  the only thing us shamans get after 50 is the slow spells that are nice YAY!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Dudes think about it. If we had super pets and gear that made 200 wis easy we would be invincible. Its already kind of ridiculous we get a pet in the first place. You know how many times Ive been in a group where the other classes were envious that our class even gets a pet at all? As far as the sov spells go, I think they rock! A nice poisen dd so our cold isnt ressed, a cool group str buff too. Im lv 40 and at no point in my playing have I felt so powerfull and confident.

</FONT><HR>Dont get me wrong slaiyn and Whampaa are both right. One one hand I think Shamans are great they dont need much more or we would be too powerful and we all know thats the Necros job to be too powerful. On the other hand I wish some one at verant would accually start a shaman so they know how to properly up grade us. For one more group buffs please and not no sally group buffs either.It doesnt have to be that much more mana efficent just so we dont have to spend an hour buffing everyone. how many time is the group waiting on us shammies to finish buffing everyone and then rebuffing 30 min later. And our lvl 55 pet, my god, I take it as an insult they even gave us that. I wont be wasteing my plat on that stupid spell. In general we really dont get anything that makes me say wow cant wait to get to lvl 50 whatever and get that new spell.<P>But I do love playing my shaman  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Wampaa wait till you are lvl 50+ then you will see how useless shaman's start to become. Dont get me wrong i love playing my shaman.  But our stat buff great but with all the caps on stats most high lvls are caped or almost caped.  Before kunark and Sov shaman's and all class's in my opinion were well balanced but after 50 is when we just start sucking.  the only thing we have going for us after 50 is our slow spells. Like I said take a look at our 50+ and compare them to other class's. And as far as our slow spells we only beat enchanters by 5% is all so we are not that much more superior in that line aswell. all i want is some better group buffs not this **** group disease or charisma crap and i would also like to see the shaman's get some offensive spells after50+.  i counted we get 2 new dots and one new nuke and 2 crappy rain and area effect spells after 50+. And no i am not a cry babie just stating the facts.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>1st of all the pox dot is nice but only good for soloing and maybe a big ubber mob that the fight might last longer than 2mins.  And yes i agree totally that our stat buffs are king but wouldnt it be nice to have some of them in a group buffs and YES i know we get them but at 57 i think we should get a few smaller ones alittle sooner than 57. also why cant we get group regen or regrowth the druids get it and most of them dont even  specialize in alter like us shamans. that must be because we got it before them so to make up for giving it to us early give them it in group.  ohh no thats right we get them GREAT group disease and posion buff yay. and we also get group scale form whoopie=(.  And btw by the time you hit 60 most tank class's will have there stats at the cap or pretty damn close. what good is a 67strbuff to a player who has 180 or 200 already ohh yeah they can carry more i guess thats a plus.=( Most high elf pallys i know at lvl 50+ are pretty damn close to the stat cap.  Maybe if they raised the stat cap then these spells would be more usefull. And I am not saying that they are totally useless,  Just less effecient is all.  they are really nice for the newbs though. I also agree with tower about the fact that before Kunark and Sov shamans could hang with most people class's as far as dishing out there fair share of dmg but after 50 they are not the dmg dealers they were before kunark.  And no i am not asking to get as many dots as necros just a few more than 2 after 50+ and did you happen to see when we get those 2 one at 56 one at 59. i think we should get a couple before that like may be at 53 and 55 or somthing.  i mean we only get one offensive spell before that and its at 54a dd cold based spell, thats good of course. the one rain spells] sux arse big time and a area effect spell which also sux. dont count as good spells IMHO. I would like to see us get maybe a cold based dot i know it wont be great in Sov but still would be different a dot that no one else has. After all our lvl 49 dots were given to the Necros why not give us some dot line thats cold based and ours. we get 2 dots that the necros dont get and thats the 2 new ones at 56 and 59.  And one final thing i am not complaing that i cant get a group i am just saying we need more. not sure what but something is all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I've looked over the post from Absor and the posts here and something I would most like would be to better define us moreso as our place seems to lack in the 50's as put by others that buffs aren't as useful and needed as we get all the group buffs which IMO should have been earlier instead of being the majority of our high level spells.  I mean cmon when we're in a group in the 50's we're there for buffs and debuffs and maybe it wasn't the intention and enchanters were to be the debuff masters but our class itsels is a class of mystics who charm and hex others.  It would be nice if we were given more debuff spells to set us apart in the 50's as our buffs up to 49 are great and it's nice to get the new upgrades but the group ones I consider a waste as everyone I would group with would prefer the +67 str buff over a +40 group str even if it is mana efficient.  I really love my shaman and love the place I have but would just love more variety and I really hope they work on our pet at 55 as it's pretty worthless and not worth looking forward to.  Everyone I talk to seems to agree that we should get something to show accomplishment that we're 55 and getting our final pet like the necro got with their specter pet.  If we were not intended to be a line with pets then why at 34 we get one every spell level from then on until 50+?  I love my class for the variety but some of our spells are just not useful as a whole and hate that most of our spells except for stat buffs could be replaced by a druid strength buff if needed and a enchanter could slow and cripple in our place.  It makes us seem like a hybrid than our own class really.  I wouldn't trade my character for any other class but just would like to voice my opinion on our class after 50.  I have no complaints at all about our spells before 51 as they were very balanced.  I think that we honestly should have got the group buffs spell starting at 34 as we're supposed to be a group oriented class but don't have any group spells until 51 until our strength buff at 39 from velious.  <P><P>------------------<BR>Slaiyn Murdoch<BR>53 Shaman Mystic<BR>Bristlebane Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Yes I will agree we needed our group stuff started before 50+ lvls. but as you pointed out yes a druid can replace us for some of the buffs, and an enchanter to replace us for debuffing mobs and slowing, then ya got Necros replacing us for the big DoTs, DAMN look at that you can have either 3 people doin the job of one shammy, yes I know we can;t do it all of it all of the time but we can do 2 jibs or aleast I have no problems doin buffing and then either slowing or dotting I love my shammy and when I play my SK or Warrior I want a shammy backing me up  instead of a druid or encahter cause awell played shammy can;t be replaced except by 2 or 3 other chacters.. hehe... and plus I know most guys who lead raids to the planes or dragons love t have shammies in them cause we are a very good well balanced class...  As for the post 50 yeah think we could of lived without the poison buff and such and give us another damage spell but I am sure and I know for a fact reading other boards that every class is not happy with thier post 50 spells, so you live with it cause like the saying goes it is the only game in town....<P>any ways laters</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Promo i think you missing the point bro if we are supposed to be the best  buff debuff class in the game why is it that our buffs in some case's are only slightly better than others.  And my big complaint isnt before 50 i think shamans are awsome before 50 its in the later lvls is when we become less effcient is all. And btw most groups will pass up a shaman everytime for a chanter or cleric.  because chanters can clarity speed up the tanks atck way better than us and are needed for the crowd control. And clercis can rez heal and have the best HP AC buffs in the game.   And most tanks would rather have a 60% haste than a 67str buff.  Bottom line at higher lvls chanters clerics and tanks are needed all others are fill ins . This is a never ending battle there are you shamans out there that think they should keep shamans they way they are most of you are prob below 50 is my guess why you think this way.  I do love playing my shaman but it piss's me off when they give our spells away like our bread and butter 49 dots to the necros=(. And did you happen to see when they get our spells just 51 and 52 just 3lvls after we got them=(</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000013&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I have got to go with the majority on this one.  Hi, I play on the Tholuxe Paells server and must admit that as a newbie I loved it when a high level cleric would run by and cast all kinds of AC/HP buffs on me.  Now as a shaman, I run by people and cast buffs on them, and they send me tells asking what the heck I am.  Oh great.  Try explaining a shaman to people...they get the impression that we are druids on steroids.  I mean COME ON Verant...we all know you guys love the necros best (they're you're babies) but PLEASE give us something we can be proud of. For example, loose the wimpy wolf and gimme a nice bear pet.  I wouldn't mind running around with a named Kodiak by my side.  The druids' wolf pet suits them very well; it matches their class.  Bears would fit a shaman much better than wolves.<P>I must admit that IMHO we have some of the best DoTs around.  No one and I mean no one can touch our poison DoTs  (Except Verant's pet of course: the necro).  But I do think that we should get a better DoT upgrade then Torrent of Poison.  Bane of Nife should be just a little stronger and I'd be happy with just that.  And, to rant and rave about a point that we've all said over and over, what do we get that sets us apart?  Necros and mages have awesome pets.  SK's are offensive power houses.  Enchanters get crowd control.  Wizzies and Druids port all over the globe. Bards are everyone's favorite group completer.  And tanks mash for damage out the butt.  But us?  What do we get to be?  Cleric wanna-be's.  I understand that Shamen are basically the "primative" healers, but can't we get something better than Alchemy?<P>The group buffs should come in the late 30's.  That's when the hell starts, so that should be when the awesome rewards for leveling start.  The Talisman's are great; don't get me wrong they're awesome for getting your group to balance out a little more (and making sure you and the other casters can melee when low on / out of mana) but that's about it.  What lvl 50+ warrior really needs a str buff?  Please.<P>Oh well.  I'm gonna just keep playing because I like this class a lot.  What ever anyone else says, they are a challenge to lvl and fun to play as.  And most people have a kind word for you at the low levels when you first learn SoW.  And since we can't research, we get to find the NPCs that have our last bunch of spells and pummel the spells out of them...that's always good for a laugh and some exp.  If anyone reads this and you are running around one night and see me there, feel free to discuss inside EQ..maybe the "gods" will hear enough of us complaining and we'll be granted mercy and valor...and better spells!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000014&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well, here's the problem post-50. It isn't so much that we can't carry our offensive end of the table anymore. In most cases, shamans were not designed to be an offensive class any more than the other priest classes are. Leave that to necros and mages and wizzies. The problem occurs because, frankly, stat buffs are more or less useless at this level. And, problemetically enough, almost a third of the Kunark spells were...you guessed it. Stats buffs. Sure, you can toss Avatar onto a warrior, but by that time his stats are likely already up in the 160 to 180 range, and the awesome power of avatar is essentially negated. Putting it onto that level 4 twink of your friends, on the other hand...<grin>. It would be nice to actually get some good offensive spells, I admit. Pox is strong, but when group fights last maybe a minute, DoTs just aren't a viable line anymore. Necros, for example, lose a lot of their vaunted superiority in groups, simply because all those mighty lines of DoTs take TIME to kill. DD is king in groups. How many post-50 (useful) dd spells do we get? Gee, um, I think...1? Plus those two, um...wonderful...rain spells. Lovely. And it's ice based, and thus a good deal less useful in Velious. And as for the slow spells, sure they're nice. But frankly, enchies can do it damn near as well, and they have a LOT of other stuff to offer their group. Mezzes, Quickness line, AC buffs, Rune series. Jeez. I honestly don't think that many of the people at Verant responsible for shaman (or anything else, for that matter) things really get the role of our class post-50. The problem is, really, that we don't HAVE a good role. We can buff and debuff. Gee. Lucky us. I would've liked to see some new, powerful slows and possibly a few more powerful damage line spells. Even some different buffs (ie not just stats) would have been nice. Shamans up to 50 kick ass. Then, though, I don't know. We're just...missing something. Cmon, Verant, help us out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000015&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Yeah the major reason that shamans are not as useful post 50 is like ya say most tanks have cloet to is not maxed 200 so the magor problem is since they made where you can go beyond 50 gettign cool stuff that adds str dex etc, but they didn;t make the max bigger.. ok see if you follow me here if say the max for any stat was 250 then our buffs would then agian be useful right cause we can boost byound the 200 max I think the problem with most of our post 50 spells is we hit the cap on the stats but if the stats were higher they would be useful... that jsut an idea, and aso think we should have one or 2 more nice dd or one DD and one of our 30 secodn DoT or somethign like that, but even if they dont; change it still will play my shammy cause I like the class and have fun playing it..oh and as for being below 50 yep 44/45 right on the edge, but I have played warriors at around 50 and also I play my buddies 53 cleric alot when he needs him to be played, so I do know some about post 50 and yes a cleric is a must have post 50 well not must have but I know most tanks realy realy want one...hehe... <P>but most groups in SoV like having Shammies least the ones I hang out with like us over druids and alot of tanks like enchters but I have gottenin groups over encherts a couple time a rare occerance but it happens.  <P>well I do think our spells need some work even our new poison DD needs some tweeking to get it up to par to our Ice DD and as for Ice being useless in SoV nope I use it over my poison  and dont; get resisted that much... then again think alot of the post 50 spells were thought about in a hurry and not much thinking of thier usefullness put in mind...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000016&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Just putting my 2 cp in.   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  Have you seen the druid 55th level pet yet?  Its a joke its 27th level, good for nothing except agroing mobs.  Puts our spells in a little perspective, no?<P>Seems the big complaint is our stat buffs are fairly wothless at 50 plus to to the 200 stat cap.  Changing the cap to 250 wouldn't help us much, the tanks would just hunt for more stat items.  What if our buffs allowed them to TEMPORARILY exceed the stat cap?  That would give us a role no class could compete with!  <P>I love playing a shaman, heck I even restarted on Thouluxe Palles with one, the class is the swiss army knife for Norath.  Granted there isn't much we're the best at but we can fill ANY roll needed. Post 50 this may not be so true, but most of the complains about class balance is post 50.  Face it VI still hasn't figured out how to balance the classes at that level.  Let em know what your  complaints and solutions are, who knows maby someday they'll actually listen.  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I feel so bad for all you shamans...I really do.  The new spells are not as nice as other characters.  Unless you are the other characters who are saying the same thing about the shamans and those other characters.<P>What I like about SoV?  A new place to explore.  Dwarven women whose buxums are actually round instead of the points.  (I know, nobody looks at the half clad female characters, Verant just put it in there for authenticity)  Blue Mob means an easier kill for a full group.  Grouping is now a requirement in SoV except for the very high end players.  <P>As for bells and whistles, we tank classes feel your pain.  We really do.  As I monk I can look forward to my new spells? No, Or I can look forward to my new skills?  No.<P>You poor poor shamans, just got the raw end of a whole new land to explore and visit but I figure most of you want go as the spells just don't meet your percieved status.<P>Fiest<BR>Celestial Triari<BR>First Order of the Blood Knights<BR>Bristlebane</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000018&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Where to start...?<BR>Not needed? Or maybe, overlooked? I have been asked to join groups many times in Seb, KC, Kael, etc. Even though I am in Gfay, or somewhere else a whole world away. Even provided with the tele. <P>I play my shaman as a pure caster. How many pure casters out there have a 900 ac and over 2k htpts? Not to many that I have seen, even fully buffed. Slow is a huge agro, and yes an enchanter can slow as well, but they are usually busy keeping things nice and mezed. Druids can dot too, but come on, they are just there for their nukes, and evacs.<P>I have a wizzy, chanter, necro, pally, all fully twinked 20th lvl, and sitting. Why, I love my shaman, people love shaman. I have no trouble at all getting a group at 54 (55 with any luck in a day or so). <P>As for our pet, I dont know what pet shop you all went to, but mine has no problem tanking giants in bw for me. The down time to get all set up with em, and buff em out is a little much, but I think its reasonable. Even wurms can be done with a little ingenuity. <P>When it comes down to it, we shaman make ok tanks too. The clerics, enchanters, etc appreciate not taking the hits when the tank(s) die, and we can evac safely. <P>If we keep comparing the shaman class to all the others, yes, they are lacking in some areas, but I am sure that clerics would love to have sow all the time. I think rangers would like a better heal. They can barely keep up with cannIII. Every class is lacking something, thats what grouping is for. <P>The new spells are cool, because they are different. If everyone wasnt so worried about "beating the game" maybe the complaints would decrease. I look forward to being a bear at all times. The first time I saw it I asked all kinds of questions, because it was so different. <P>I know many people who actually worry about running through Kithcor at night, not me, my sow is plenty fast to get me through, jboots just dont cut it sometimes, and I have the htpts to take what I have too. <P>The long and short of it is yes our post 50 spells are a little disappointing, but at least we got something. Its amazing how much people complain about what they dont have, and just cant be happy with what they have. We are a very powerful class, and can make the difference between sucess and falure. Stop looking at every little inperfection, and youll see that.  <P>If you are haveing a problem grouping, maybe its something personal...<P> <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=50&topic=000025.cgi&ReplyNum=000020&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=Shaman+gripe">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I've read this same threat in almost every class specific board I've been in, I don't know any class thats 100% happy with their lvl 50+ spells.<P>However to keep things in perspective, none of your spells require an essence emerald to cast which means having a lvl 46+ level player suiciding with no chance of exp restoration.  Average cost about 1000pp - consuamable in casting.
