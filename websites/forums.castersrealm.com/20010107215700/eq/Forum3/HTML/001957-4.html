</FONT><HR>Read this all and you will understand just a part of what it is to be truely "In Our World"<BR> <BR>Well I read almost ever post up there most range from saying the game is boring just a repetitive leveling systems and that as you get high in levels the better items you get and the bigger and bad creatures you get to kill thinking it a bigger achievement then that "First Rat" all in a game that does not affect anything to any value excpet "Farmers and the dreaded Ebay".<P>Also Realizer put it pretty straight forward and to the point. That unless you dedicate a piece of your daily life to EQ you won't get very far. The serious player would see them as ghosts thier there then there gone for what seems a heck of a long time (12hour not playing)to a serious player is a bloody long time and at the 6hour of going to work or sitting in tier class rooms wondering what there goona do in EQ when they get home.<P>I will be the first to admitt it. I am addicted to a game that doesn't affect my life in any way except pull me from the real world and maybe something that would benift me in some way.<P>All I said before is what an addict says to defend him/herself but not condeming what they hold dear but also defend it as well. This game is a Online Community, where you and everyone involved in a game such as this weither its Ultima Online, Diablo or any game that you won't get railgun in the head before you type one word  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> can go into and socialize without fear of regection or reprisal. If you become addicted to this game you will play it and you will slowly or quickly level depending on your game play to level 60 the max end of the road. You know what it won't stop there youll think of something to keep you playing until you hit rock bottom then you'll say youve had enough. Once your free of this game you'll have one of your buddies cause we all know most players in EQ have one friend in the same city they know of and hang with them in the game or out. Will give you an ICQ or e-mail with this all new game that rocks better than that game at first you'll say no but you always get pulled in unless you can find something to fill in that time you have been spending in EQ or your prefered online game you will come back to fill it.<P>All this some may say is true but most will say whatever. Trust me I'm living proof and it cause me greif sometimes. I played Ultima Online for over two years LOL. Did everything had everything and I accomplished all that in about the first year then the rest I was there to socialize and hang with friends cause that is what this is all about. Its not the level your at its not the items you have its your Bud's doing what you like to do while hanging with friends. <P> This game is slower paced than UO but its the same pull "Community of People that gather in one place, time and interact". Social Interaction so what if is on a computer it will be the new age once technology catches up with the demand for closer interaction over the internet. Cyber Space. It will come it only a matter of time.<P>The only negative thing about all of this and its a big one HUGE and this is why it sadens me to be addicted to something so fun and entertaining. The fact that I will most like never see these people who I care about and respect. Some may never become involved in these games like I have I'm hardcore gamer. Realizers description is me to the "T". The negative thing is in the larger picture is as these games become more adept at interact the further and further people will become from one another. The fall of that 70% of communication is in Body language you will never see that hear and as we are pull towards the safer social relations of the internet.<P>"I'm in there world now and I can't get out"<P>The key to escape my friends is finding a way to filling that time and the will power to restrain from coming to your computer. Words from an addict to those not fully pluged in find something else it's fun but it will pull you from society and human interaction and get you a big belly  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">.<P>Once again if you got this far, this game is a Complicated Chat Room, the leveling and the items and developing a character is all extra, it's the socializing that makes people stay. Who want to abandon a good freind even if he is a Big Fat Oger and scratches his ass every 10seonds  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">.<P>I bid you all well, May you have the will to pull away when something better in life comes along. Good Luck<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000076&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>What is boring, but needed is camping for xp. Some ppl might enjoy questing or adventuring, but what I did was sit and camp xp till I am high enough to go adventuring. U might say, that's so boring, how could u spend so much time doing that? and my answer is, that with the time I've spent camping experience, I can now fight dragons in Kunark for I am of too high a level to fight the normal dragons of Norrath. Instead of just adventuring through the normal world, I have seen all 3 planes and am off to see even more planes i.e Veeshan's peak. And all i can say is I never run when i see a Sandgiant/Hillgiant anymore. Instead, I take out my trusty heiro crook and beat the thing to death. Yes I can melee a SG down and i'm very happy of it  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> Adventuring at low lvls is nice, but adventuring around never having to worry about dying and seeing things that only a few people can see is always great  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> Just my 2cp<P>Roxy Silentpaw<BR>57 Preserver of the Soul Assassins<BR>Lanys Tvl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000077&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Real simple to figure out..What isnt camped (Due to YES VERANT, overcrowding, isnt worth camping. Leads to burnout. I have several twinks, and a couple of decent chars on other servers. Verant is so full of BS when they answer with that canned 'make friends, adventure some'. Hey fellas, unless your part of some uber guild, your stuck. As for 'adventuring' some, who the heck want to go adventure where other idiots are training all the time and GM/Guides are nothing but lazy. (Well, except the ones that take the time to call you a liar) What do you get for trying to report someone? Nadda. You get a GM/Guide that shows up an hour later AFTER the problem player has logged. pfe. Thanks fer nothing. Add - Leveling is WAY too slow. What happened to risk vs reward anyway? Cant keep a promise any better then Mico$oft..And in advance, dont bother with the canned 'Have you checked out Kunark or &lt;Zone of canned response here&gt;. YES I have, as we all have. They suck. Y? Refer to above. Add - Ok, Ill invalidate this whole post for Verant..Im a &lt;sniff&gt; casual player..&lt;OMG!&gt; Thats right, the core group that paid Verants light bills. I dont have 4 hours a night to 'make friends, adventure some, and wait for a (What has got to an all time st00pid decision on Verants part) 30 hour spawn (Referring to Ishva..Good thinkin Verant..Ever actually play the game?) Nuff said on that, We've all read the cut and paste response, so dont bother.<BR>To answer the question more directly, "How viable is playing EQ if not to level or obtain items?  Is there sufficient storyline content, quests, dynamic events, such that you could play mid level for a long time and still get great fulfillment?" Pfe. I have a 44 Chanter and a SMR..Its all could scrounge to get it. My time with EQ is almost over. so I guess the answer is...no. not even.<BR>One more thing, since I ve been all over the map with this response..Verant, you have stated at least twice in responses that you have hit a 'similtaneous on line' record. (Ya I goofed the spelling, its a game, relax) I wouldnt be so damn proud of it. Your server response has gone down the tubes. The lag is unacceptable, and unless you get on at 7AM Central time, you cant camp a thing with or without a group. You should look at both sides of a figure like that. (I am a well qualified network guy myself, no, I dont expect you to believe me, after all Im a customer) However, With numbers like yours the resulting performance simply outlines Verants lack of dedication to maintaning any reasonable level of service. So before you go out and tot your horn again, check whats on the other side of those numbers. One last thing..That question about paying some idiotic amount per month for a 'premium server' went over like a ton of bricks. Good thinking...Hope you guys have all socked away some pp of your own, youll need it. as for fufure online games, if they have Verant or 989 on them, you can count me out. (O and if you think Im talking outta my but..I DARE you to post a questionaire asking 'Would you consider buying another product if the software is written or supported by 989/Verant'. Ill hold my breath for that one.

</FONT><HR>Yes.<P>I am a level 55 Shamaness on Quellious. I reached level 50 before the expansion and I did not do it one long camp. There are many places to go, many things to do, and many GOOD (as well as bad) people to meet. I would spend time (Maybe on day playing) camping something for exp and then run off for a new quest or to help out people I came across that seemed to need it. For me, this was very fulfilling and made the levels seem to fly by. I think the ones that hate the leveling process and complain the most are the ones that like to fight with anyone they come across, quick to accuse and ready to flame at the drop of a hat. How can anyone with such a sour outlook enjoy anything? This is a GAME and therefore meant to be leasurly and enjoyable. So quit obsessing on how much exp are you going to get today? How much money can you sucker out of a player for an item that you farmed? Who saw what mob first and who KS'd who? Go out, enjoy the game, do some QUESTS, create YOUR OWN story line, help someone that is truely new to the game. You will find yourself satisfied at last.<P>For an example of people that have created their own stories for this roleplaying GAME, go to Quellious Quarters and check out their roleplaying forum. It is very interesting and enlightening in the gaming world of EverQuest.<P>Thank you,<BR>Tinily Spiritblood<BR>Luminary<BR>Quellious (Legendary Defenders)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000079&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>So, what keeps ME interested?  Many many people gripe and complain about the fact this game is so group oriented.  That you cannot get anywhere soloing, etc, etc...  Well, I've played this game longer, have put in more time than ANY other game in the history of me gaming (.. that's about 16 years).  I credit that to the fact that the game IS in fact dependent on the group dynamic.  I've played many many games by mysely and do they ever get boring after a while.  "Predictable" is the word I'm thinking of.  But these days, I find the strategy of getting the most out of each person's talents awesome.  It's the "people element" that keeps it all interesting.<P>There will of course be times when I feel a little burnt out on what I'm doing and so I just take a break...  but no longer than a week or two later and I'm back.  Even recently I (much to my surprise) found fun in trade skills *gasp*.  But, as it has turned out, I had great fun haggling over prices with folks, trying to hord the most cash I could, then go out and buy myself something nice (again, haggling for the best price I could get).  Who knows why.  Just my mood I guess.<P>I suppose when your ultimate goal isn't to get to level 60, you open up other possibilities.  Ya, lots of folks would find trade skills boring, fine, we aren't all alike (duh).  I found them boring for a long time and instead found entertainment in playing multiple characters.  It greatly reduced the "monotony" factor by allowing variety in play style.<P>It has been said many times by many folks, but this type of game allows a great many avenues for enjoyment.  Exploration (wander into that dungeon and see what's there), experimentation (combine that newly introduced gem with that metal and see what happens), and opening up to a variety of goals have proven to keep my attention a long while.<P>Just a couple thoughts,<BR>Eldihn<P>Disclaimer: All spelling errors are fictional and any resemblance to real words is entirely coincidental.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000080&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>All this game is, apart from chatting with people is just camping and killing stuff. Yes, you can try trade skills, but to get the money to lvl them and get to the point where its a moneymaker you have to kill and camp stuff. Every now and then, Verant tries to add some plots, but since few people really care about it...it's just window dressing mainly. Nothing is dynamic, you go into EQ one time, a month later its the same except for maybe a few perks added. Ultima online at least lets you solo or not have to kill if you want to. Don't get me wrong, i like to play eq but they need to make it more interesting if they want to keep people from going to the next-generation online games.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000081&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Hey all of you flamers of EQ I am with you 100%, just because the mid-high levels just weren't fun for me.  I gave away all of my crafted and int stuff from my 27 warrior and 25 mage to my guild and simply play twinks now, I play an 11 ranger and 9 monk, and that is maybe an hour every 3 days.  There are far better games coming out, no need to get stressed out over little ole' EQ.  It will be vapor soon enough to the MMORPG masses, both casual and hardcore.  There are true RPGs coming out where you won't have to kill a thing, and most people won't for fear of their characters PERMANANT death.  These new games won't have static spawns (i.e. CAMPING) they will have NPCs that give birth via sexual reproduction (better RP I would say).  Those that don't want to actually roleplay a character like a story will stick with EQ, but those that are actually looking to take a lonely gnome from birth to that evil god figure with followers and worshipers will be able to.  If you want to make a character to become a master shipbuilder then by all means, go for it.  And the best part about these new games?  YOU GET EXPERIENCE FROM EVERY TASK!  Never draw a blade and become level 100, you can't fight but hey, you are there...  Just a thought for you all that like to complain, STOP, and QUIT!  I will very very soon.  Prexus has gotten very boring to me lately.  And for those who might know me I am Wuden Bladeborne and Kanadr of Prexus, see you online (whenever I get REALLY bored).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000082&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I've played EQ since Beta 2.<P>Played a monk in the betas then a NEC to level 50 before the Expansion and now a Druid to 53rd level (Started when the expansion launch)<P>With the exception of taking a 90 day break early this year and the rare vacation I am in EQ on a daily basis for at least 2-3 hours if not the entire evening.<P>I was totally burned out on the game last Christmas and looking for something different.  I didnt care for AC (Graphics were crappy) and Shadowbane was a distant hope so I decided to do something different.<P>I got 5 people to switch servers to join me and we powerleveled them up.  For example the Cleric only took about 3 days to get 29th level (20 hours play time) with my druid thorning and the enchanter giving clarity and the shaman healing.<P>I've been in the Uber Guilds and can say the fighting over the drops is stupid (And the politics are even worse).  Fear and Hate are boring.<P>Were just getting to the point were the rest of my group is in their high 40's and we have our keys to Old Seblis and the Howling Stones.<P>I figure the nightly raids on HS and OS are going to hold our interests for several more weeks.  They I suppose SoV will be out for us to conquer.<P>Though I do see the first MMORG that comes out with better graphics than EQ and improves upon the crappy guild and combat systems that Verant will lose 50%+ of it's player base.<P>K2</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000083&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Everquest... I have been playing since the first week it went public.  have many different characters, many different levels.  Though I never made it past level 30, just because the camping is dull.  I switched to Rallos Zek to add spice, I don't pk but it gives the edge of possibility that someone might pk me.  But problem is on that server, everyone is "bagging" etc.  So the trust environment isnt really there.  It was suggested to turn RZ to a coin-only loot but I don't see that happening.<BR>Problem is that Everquest is a level/item game.  The quests are rather dull.  I haven't bothered doing a quest for the last year.  Easier to just buy the finished quest item of f someone else.  I keep reading about the supposedly dynamic quests put on by GM's etc.  Bah.  One time I saw the GM's playing a MOB was in GFay and they were "Super" faeries.  Everyone got frustrated because we couldn't figure out what they were doing or wanted.  Instead I was observing, doing nothing hostile and one killed me.  Bang...  wtf?  and they were red to me.  No explanation.  Seemed like the GMs just decided to be pks without level restrictions. Oh that is so much fun for the player.  Well I play Everquest because it is something to do when I get home from work.  But I can't wait until the the "next" company comes out with a more interactive game, and it will happen then EQ will be like UO.  Have its following but not growth.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000087&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Everyone in this game is a slave to the xp bar. For a month before I got my own account,I wasn't. No need for xp... Just waited patiently for Kunark to come out to have to restart my characters. I did the enchanter SolRo quests... They took little to no time to complete. And were in no way "fun". I chatted with friends and guildmates. Even tried to camp the GB for a pallie friend.... What did this month teach me, you may ask? Well, I learned that unless you're not out for an item or xp, THERE IS NOTHING ELSE THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED FUN! At least for me. <P>Baelish asked:<BR>"How viable is playing EQ if not to level or obtain items? " <P>My answer... It isn't. As much as people joke about it, Everquest should be renamed, Evercamp. At least then it would live upto it's name. Maybe Velious will change this. From what I've read, there sounds to be a story line to Velious. Too bad only the Uberguilds will get to have fun there. Kunark attempted to make people group up just to get from one zone to the other. Velious, from what I've read, will shove this idea straight down your throat. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000089&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>  Everquest was designed to addict.  They spent a lot of time creating this fake world which will suck you in and addict you.  If they let you lvl quickly, you might miss out on the other parts of the game which are meant to keep you at low lvls for a long time.  If everyone hit 60 in a month, there would not be any players left after a very short time.  In Gordons response, he states that some of the customers choose to lvl quicky, and they like it.  Then he goes on to say that this sort of playing is mindless.  He discourages this sort of play publicly because he wants us to play for a long time.  Many people people refer to Everquest as Evercrack.  I do ont think that this is too far from the truth.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000091&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Folks... no matter how many times you say "You make the fun you want", it doesn't make it any more profitable to stand and chat all day. Most RPG players need change. They need to see that what they do gives them *something* apart from good friendship if they're socializing. In EQ, the only way to get xp is to kill. That's a fact that cannot be changed, unless Verant choose to do so.<P>You can't be jumping down holes in the ice all day ;-) Seriously, that is a "Let's have some crazy fun!", not an everyday project :) Variation is probably the key. I will not camp. But one day I may just hunt, next day hunt with a group, and next day again, just hang around and talk.<P>Aye, your day in Norrath is what you make it, but Verants camping system isn't exactely helping out, neither is the capping system on tradeskills.<P>-Erilin, Mithaniel Marr(EQ), Thistledown(AC). </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000093&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>For Chrissakes people!  If you don't want to item or exp camp, don't.  If you are a powergamer, you might be better off with UO or some single-player game(Baldur's Gate, yeah!).  You say that there's nothing more to this game than camping or leveling?  Well maybe it's the way you play it.  I just can't comprehend how you can keep playing while hating this game so much. Addiction?  Well, that sounds like a personal problem, don't blame the designers of the game.  This game is their life you know, a major achievement. I think the major problem here is that most of the servers are non PvP.  To me, no MOB compares to taking on an actual person.  PvP is a whole another realm to EQ.  You really have to use your head, as well as reflexes(and maybe a juiced up system). </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000094&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>As far as I can tell, there is no storyline what-so-ever.  I realize there are GM events time to time, but these seem to involve a relatively small number of people in the larger scope of the entire player base of Everquest.  <P>Now for a suggestion:  why not time to time make something happen in the world?  It wouldn't have to be the same on every server (or maybe it would, no idea how your coding works), but based on how the players deal with what happens, have something else happen.  Some of these situations could be dealt with in the matter of a night, while others may take months to resolve.  They could be anything from a race/class/race-class declaring war on another race/class/race-class, or a sort of a mystery (the wolves of nektulos forest have grown in power ten-fold and no one knows why or how to stop them...go to it).  You wouldnt' (and I suggest shouldn't) even have to announce some of these things happened, they should just be noticed.  My first case above should probably be announced to the people involved though, as even though the people of a land sometimes have no control over when a war happens, they all know it's going on.<P>Anyway, just some suggestions to make it more interesting and involve more people.<P>Cheers<P>Ferhago</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000097&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">
