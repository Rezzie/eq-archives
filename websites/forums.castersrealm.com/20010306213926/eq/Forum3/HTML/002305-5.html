</FONT><HR>In regards to the changes in Agro for Clerics, all I have to say is "Ouch".  I hunted with a group in Firiona Vie, going after the Drachnids and Frogloks around there.  A few strange things happened:<BR>1) Some mobs that were being pulled by the druid (who grabbed it with a DOT) passed everybody just to get at me, the cleric, who hadn't even cast a single spell yet! I mean, a Druid wacks a mob with a DOT to pull it, one would think that he'd be number one on the hate list. But, for some reason, that cleric way in the back looks REALLY dangerous. Whatever...<BR>2) Mobs from almost out of sight, way off in the distance can use their newly gotten Cleric Sight ability to see me. This happened to me twice in that hunt.  I watched first as one Drachnid perked up and charged at me from  a mighty long ways away. And this was just me topping off some group mate's health well after a battle.<BR>3) The enchanter of the group was doing her job well by mezzing the add-on for a pull.  When the mezz wore off, bang...all on the cleric.<P>Verant...the healing spells affecting the mob hate list was fine before.  I saw no need in changing it.  This new "Feature" is just simply insane!  If it stays this way, I feel forced to do one of two things:<BR>  1) change my specialization to Abjuration, and heal with the HP/AC Buffs...because they don't cause as much agro  (oops!  I shouldn't have said that!  Now They'll Nerf that too).<BR>  2) stop playing my cleric altogether and play a druid....like everyone else.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000101&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>In regards to Dynamic Content...I think the people in Verant are a bit confused in the definition of this term.<BR>Making changes to the game system, game rules and/or game mechanics is NOT the definition of Dynamic Content. <BR>Dynamic Content is the ever changing history, storyline and overall content of the IN-GAME world. Quests that, when performed and completed, change the world structure around us.  Since I started playing over 2 years ago, the guards in front of Qeynos have been muttering something about their leader. Why hasn't anything been done?  The political structure remains the same.  Nothing in the world has changed...save the addition of new, static continents to explore.<P>If you want to change something in EverQuest, change the IN-GAME things, and stop tinkering with the parts of the game system that work!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000102&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>VI, <P>I am orgianally a 53 paladin, but me and a RL friend share a 55 clerics account, after the patch, he told me that i have to try healing with the cleric now.<P>so i did we traded characters, we where in Western Wastes Dragon Slaying. anyways we pulled the next dragon the melee's engaged the dragon, and wher ekilling it, it was down maybe to 7/8 life. i saw a wizard in my group had a bub of health gone. he hadnt engaged in combat yet, he was waiting for the melees to build aggro.<P>So i casted Remedy on the wizard who was sitting watching the melees fight the dragon. and Bam i was summoned hit for 208 then i ran away.<P>i was like wow that was wierd, sat down, and bam was summoned again, hit for 208,169, <P>ok now im at half health or so, so i casted Divine light on myself, only to get ubber aggro and beat down, dragon decided i was looking good for lunch.<P>now what i purpose to you, is you lessen the amount of hate per spell. i casted 2 spells and died for it on someone who wasnt even engaged in combat. <P>It may have been "nerfed" before but your going to drive alot of clerics to quitting, if they cant heal then its pointless to play. a 55 druid can heal better then a cleric and not build the aggro a cleric can by healing, it seems your change has made it so Clerics get ubber aggro, just cause there clerics.<P>something needs to change though or i forsee a mass exodus very soon.<P>Drakinn Draconis <BR>53rd Cavalier<BR>RN</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000103&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well...  here's my comment<P>EQ is not just a game, it's MMORPG<P>So...  I think of it this way.  Just as we discuss between each other, develop strategies, and share knowledge, we may reach some level of success in our battles.<P>It would only make sense to me that what we fight, based on its intelligence, history, society, etc...  should be able to "adapt" to their attackers from direct experiences and indirectly by means of linked factions.<P>But many factors are involved.  Some things are somewhat possible through EQ with approximations while other things are impossible and thus require "class nerf" and may effect more than the one class.<P>I would like to see a bit more imagination that would invoke more of the former rather than the latter that I expect better be a freakin last resort option.<P> <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/tongue.gif"> see you on the other side<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000104&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I appreciate how some of you are suggesting chain stunning, rooting, etc.<P>My main beef is on raids dealing with level 51+ mobs, boss, dragon, and gods.<P>I find it totally outrageous that a very skilled cleric that can time a complete heal on a full buffed tank will now has just signed it death certificate.   Think about it, a skilled cleric who is trying to be very mana efficient who knows when to start casting a 10 second heal in advance is now punished with death.   Again if you are lucky to get off a DA/DB that mob will know exactly when your 18 seconds are up and will come right back to finish you off.  You are essentially dead.  No if, ands or buts.<P>Also, some of you guys might not know it, but taunt was also nerfed on this last patch.  So you can have a dozen level 60 warriors taunting on one mob, and that mob will still aggro on a cleric.   That to me is so unrealist and an outrage that warrior and tanks themselves cannot do their jobs.<P>Clerics are also forced to stand during all battles.  Gone are any chances to reduce a party/raid's downtime.  That is so ridiculous that a mob will ping pong back on a cleric who constantly stands and sits when tanks are dishing out tons of melee damage.<P>I'm really tired of trying to figure out what "secret" strategy we are suppose to do, what extra burden/task we need to perform just so we can do our job at healing.<P>This patch was a slap to all the clerics in EQ.  I must have been dreaming when VI once agreed that cleric were not fun and were open to suggestion on how to add more fun to our class.  Instead, they think that fun is to pull the rug under our feet and to give us yet another task to manage.  Lets hope we can go buy a 7.5 minute stop watch for the silly donal BP nerf.<P>Thanks for the burden and extra work.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000105&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think that a changing world is essential to a good gaming world!!!  That was one of the best things about RPG'S to begin with was every encounter was a little different and you had to adjust your strategy to that encounter.  It could have been an encounter you already had too.  Why should this be different in this game??? I do not understand why people are complaining unless they are used to the stupid why games like Tomb raider and those play where once you beat something its the same to beat it everytime!! HOW BORING!!!!  You haven't played a real RPG if this is the way you expect things to go!!!  Use your head and mind that's what makes the game fun it isn't the same everytime you see something!  So think it though and try to figure out how to do it now, that's the whole point to RPG's is that one "monster" is not exactly the same as another with the same name. i.e. HP's,AC, items etc.  Just because you go to a place to kill a "named" monster doesn't mean that the encounter will go the same everytime and that the same strategy will work every time, so find a new strategy!<P>I think this is an excellent enviroment and they have done a godd job of keeping to real RPG ideas.

</FONT><HR>It seems to me that vi wants to eliminate clerics altogether.  What is the point of logging on getting in a group and dying before group has made first kill.  As I see it the game is now healing can't be our main responsibility so what is.  Lets see nuking well everyone has a much better nuke than we do huh tanking noway with 1600 and some odd hit points fully buffed what can i tank.  I can't snare nor backstab, my root sucks I use my lvl 5 stun cause it works better than any other I have.  I can't sow nor teleport what is left for me to do well I guess i can sit around and hope someone will want me in a group for rezing cause that is about the only thing i can do better than anyone else.<BR>Please vi tell me what you would like to see me evolve into.  I might as well hang up the months I have invested in a cleric cause for the life of me I can't see what else I can do.  I can't solo and no one is going to want me in a group guess you have pretty well eliminated the cleric from the game <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/frown.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000107&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>It seems to me from most of the responses from VI that there is one common ideal being repeated over and over again.  That particular idea is that if people are coping with it, then there's no problem.  I have to say that I totally disagree with that philosophy.  There are certain things about Everquest in general that tend to get changed over time, or tampered with continuously and the general feedback is many people hate the change, a few like the change, and most are dealing with the change.<BR>     Is the goal of VI simply to have most people dealing with the changes?  In most aspects of market research, if the majority of your clients have negative feedback of any kind whether or not they are willing to deal with it, then things need to be examined heavily.  For instance, on the issue of Cleric agro and hate, many clerics in this game are highly annoyed by the change but are willing to deal with it for the simple reason that starting a new character after attaining 40+ lvls can be detremental to one's mental health.  I have heard of several clerics up and quitting completely for this very reason.<BR>     I do understand that are a minority of players that believe this change was necessary and that anyone who disagrees with this is for lack of a better word, a "puss", but should VI share the same ideals?  I am not against everything that was changed in the most recent of patches personally.  Many of the ranger issues were fixed and they needed to be fixed.  I as a cleric would love having a Donal's Bp and have it CH repeatedly till no end, however I see why it was changed.  However, I feel that the Cleric hate issue as well as others should have been considered ahead of time before many players reached this point of frustration.  Thank you for your time.<P>Vier Cotto<BR>40th Cleric of Tunare, Saryrn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000110&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Im not quite sure what you guys are talking about, im a 56 cleric and run many raids including PoG.  Now, i have never seen anyone line up cheals to land every 5sec on a warrior... if you dont know what your talking about, please dont say anything. First off, i dont have ANY aggro problems in OS.  I use celestial healing since it came out, and i only use cheal when my group is in trouble and im very low mana.  I have xp'd in the crypt for hours at a time without anyone dieing.  Cel. heal for tanks and remedy for casters is all you need mem'd.  you use 2 stun spells to stop gate/cheal on mobs.  u got 2 invuln's up and gate.  you can fast mem a group heal if you need it.  ppl plz dont talk out of your rear.  That is crazy that you need 48 clerics to heal 1 warrior.  in a raid sit. you have 8 tanks all taunting and sharing the dmg from the beast.  useful posts are required if the game is going to get better.  the cleric class is fine...<P>remember, cel heal does 900, casting time 4, 225 mana. CAST THE HEAL when the tank is down 1 bub and you'll never cheal again...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000111&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I play the game just to play it.  The only advantage I see to the new hate agro is a decline in clerics, which means finding a group will become a lot easier again.  I'm level 53 and most zones I go into now have about 25% of the zone population as clerics.  I have two clerics and haven't bothered playing my lower one since the patch.  I don't intend to stop playing my main cleric, but this new hate agro should have been implimented in steps.<P>I've been hunting in Old Sebilis a lot since I got level 50.  I can usually get into groups with friends and all goes well.  The only people I usually healed were the main tank and the enchanter, I rarely if ever got hit.  Now I have a hard time keeping myself alive after casting a small heal on anyone in the group.  Buffing also aggros things a lot more then they use to, even if you buff a person the mob isn't hitting on.<P>I know VI said it was a bug, so in fixing bugs it will more then likely take a few patches to get it right.  If it was to make clerics more interesting.. well, if I'm in Old Sebilis with just clarity and not c2, then that's all I need.  I can barely keep up enough mana to keep my group buffed and healed at all times.  With C2 this normally isn't a problem.<P>Ever since I was around level 30, I've been hunting with the same tank (my husband).  We figured out the best ways to heal and he know the best methods of taunting off of me.  Now all his spells are changed taunt factors and mine are greater taunts.  I was in fear yesterday and did a small heal on someone after they finished fighting a mob, there were 3 other mobs that were mez'd.  As soon after the first one died, all other mez wore off and they all wanted me for the small remedy I casted.  I died within seconds.<P>I've noticed that most of the time my complete heal gives less taunt then my smaller heals.  I'm not sure if this was the intent of the hate aggro or not.  I've also had a hard time with my other spells, like stuns.<P>Whenever the tanks can pull something off of me, it just comes right back when I have to heal myself.  The new hate aggros are making healing groups less efficient.  Now instead of having to keep up with 2 or 3 members of the group, the mob goes through hitting everyone.  I know this is how it should be, but trying to keep a druid or a wizard alive that's getting double hit for 130 points for a while is a lot of mana from a cleric.<P>I'm sure I'll find a way to play with the changes eventually, but in the mean time.. I'm having to get completely new gear and having to totally relearn my class which looks bad on the people I'm just meeting for the first time.  Next time VI makes big changes, they should take them in steps so players have time to adjust a bit more easily.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000112&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>This is my exp from post patch anti-cleric agro.  (im lv 53 shaman) I was in a Full group in OS. Cleric enchanter me 3 tanks. (i stress 3 tanks!) We pull a few then drop with ease.<P>Tank pulls withhalf hp and is almost dead when he comes back- enter cleric Cheal! woohoo saved that tank good job cleric you know you role and play it well...<P>Instant agro all tanks taunting, enter me I hit him with slow,notice cleric getting pummeled, i hit it with envenomed bolt as fast as I could cast it (TWICE in a ROW) and any shaman or necro knows that it is a F'in HUGE taunt with just 1 EB but i HIT BOTH within 15 seconds and it the damn frog was STILL on the cleric, i had to ROOT it to get it off the cleric.  <P>Here is why VI did this: screw to make it harder VI doesnt care how much fun the game is.  If the cleric dies 85%of the time the  <BR>group dies, so for the next hour or 2 instead of gaining exp you are trying to get corpses that equals MORE money for VI. The longer and harder it is to get to lv 60 the better for them cause we ALL keep coming back.  Thats the Bottom line period.  And btw ive tried to use sup healing to 'replace' a cleric and that is just BS, even WITH that spell I can heal 1-2bubbles but damn im better for buffing the tanks slowing, debuffing mobs, not sit and med. <BR>when I have to just heal thats what I do , no buffs maybe a slow, but I sit and heal, oh wait thats what clerics are DESIGNED TO DO, screw this new agro let them do their job, they chose cleric KNOWING their role and learning how to do it to the best of thier power and ability.<P>Nothing worse than having to wait to do a CR because of some ignorant patch designed to derail the players from leveling...that is ALL that this agro patch did.  <P>btw thanks for the new skills for melees but if the clerics are too worried about healing the tanks wtf good are the new skills for them?<P>Ergomas-Nameless 53 shaman *screwed by SOE*</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000114&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>All I have to say is VI once again made a mistake.  Either they'll fix it or they loose the healing portion of their population.  If you ask me it's their way of further evening up the classes.  They make secondary healers better at healing, then make it impossible for the primary healer to stay alive, thus increasing the usefulness of the secondary healer once again.  Of course the cleric dies but no worries.. when all the clerics are gone the seconadary healers will be there to cast the same spells the clerics did.<P>hehe<P>I've been watching them do this to the classes since early beta.  I think they do it just to take the emphasis off one class and place it on another.  It keeps us whining about different things.<P>As far as the uber taunt.. thanks VI.  Now, a certain enchanter I know will not always be the first to drop in a loosing battle, I always felt bad about that ;(.

</FONT><HR>Let me start this by stating I am not a cleric.  I have a pali (49) and a wiz (40).<P>I also have other toons 15 thru 35.  I only played 1 cleric to 14 and deleted him as he was to boring.  I respect clerics, I love their heals, but now Im afraid.  I have several cleric friends (lvls 40's thru 50's) that after 1 week of trying this new way have retired their clerics and now use them only to res friends.<P>Verant, games do not have to change to be good.  Chess is one of the oldest game on earth, yet millions love it and play it to this day.  People play Dungeons and Dragons and it has been out since the 70's.  People play a game that they have FUN with.<P>Hey, any of you Verant peeps reading this (like 1 in 1 billion chance) play DnD?  Did you ever notice the syndrome some DM's had called the "Killer DM"?  You know, the one that was upset that you have new skills and abilities that are in the rules (read Vision (tm)) but HE cant adapt the game, so nerfs your skills/spells with new made up rules?<P>Hmmmm, sound familiar Verant?  Silent nerfs like SoW works...OMG, make Velious mobs faster than SoW!  OMG, peeps invis can move safely, make Velious mobs see invis!  Now lets add bixies at night in Kith to dispell invis vs undead, random undead frogloks in live side guk!  OMG, peeps can teleport now, no more waiting 20 min for a ship and 20 more minutes for a boat ride, make the port locations be camped by dragons and snow dervishes to kill all that teleport!  What am I saying in a nutshell?  You give us a carrot (spell/skill/ability/gear) to aim for...then when we get it you change the rules to negate it!  Gawd, just make us all be back in patchwork leather with rusty weapons again with "normal" mobs and I will be happier than I am now.<P>You give us spells and abilities that were hard earned and fought for, then YOU make it so the spells/abilities/gear is worthless.<P>Just a friendly FYI for you, Verant, people play a good game they have fun with and enjoy playing.  EQ can last hundreds of years IF people enjoy the game and rules are steady (like chess).  Also, like Dungeons and Dragons, it will not take a NEW game to make us leave, we can wait 7 years till you dont have the game rights and just find a DM that IS NOT a killer DM.<P>People love EQ, it is you (the killer GM's as it is) that is making people mad.  You modify and change everything for less than 5% of your game population.  No, I am not a cleric, but I fear playing in a world that there will be hardly any clerics or wizzies.<P>I fear that unless I know someone that has a retired cleric, I wont get a rez, or a teleport unless he/she has a retired wiz.<P>But most of all Verant, I feel sorry for you.  You have such unlimited potential for one of the greatest games in history, that could be played for generations...but you are letting the "Killer GM" mentality take control.<P>You no longer see EQ as a game for us to enjoy, you have (at least subconciously) made EQ a "Us vs the players" mentality.<P>There are pathing bugs, broken quests, and a host of REAL problems that have plagued EQ since beta that are unresolved (hmmmm, sea-fury at stuck at sisters isle dock still killing shiploads of newbees sound familiar?) but let there be 1 good thing for a player and you emergency crash the servers within hours of it being discovered.<P>Sheesh...this has droned on long enough, but someone...SOMEONE should get a little hint here.  BTW, in parting, you (Verant) became upset that peeps were becoming rich in early EQ (why?) so you implemented money sinks in the game (gems more expensive, etc.)  Well, this was fine when there were only a few peeps out ot 10k peeps were in the 40's, AND mobs dropped weapons that sold for 25 plat a pop, but you nerfed the value of the dwarf drops, buffed guards,...in other words we are no longer rich!  LOSE the damn money sinks</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000118&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Xombie... who the heck are you?<P>Personally, I spend about 5% of my online time as a cleric any longer.<P>Sure I'm L60, sure I've seen and done some very interesting things (and will continue at it).<P>BUT it is very difficult for me to speak "for clerics" as I could have while not quite at L60.<P>Aside from all this here is a thought.  The current situations with heal/hate where it is not seen as a problem...  well, the cleric can now be replaced.  Granted they could be replaced before but it is more obvious than ever at this point.<P>This is a good and bad thing.<BR>Good thing: sometimes cleric hard to find, sometimes cleric leaving means whole group leaving.  Now this may not necessarily be the case.<P>Bad thing: For decent ammount of XP a cleric must group.  This is requirement post 50.  Since cleric's healing abilities have been terribly reduced they are far less attractive for grouping and will now have difficulty finding groups.  This is _fact_<P>A cleric class forms a kind of symbiotic relationship with groups for best levels of success.  And really it still is this way.  BUT VI PLEASE, if you gonna make things so freaking difficult for clerics (won't argue need on this point) you MUST COMPENSATE with some type of dimensionality.<P>I don't know about that stuff about hitting clerics before they've done anything, but I have seen first hand clerics picked out and systematically wiped out leaving the tanks with no level of assistance to kill the mob.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000120&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Why don't people at Verant take some business classes? <P>Someone above mentioned market research.  Verant is a company which every month rakes in millions of dollars in subscription fees with a team of programmers.  Why the hell do they then keep messing with stuff that doesn't please anybody?  <P>With this new cleric changes, I noticed that the people that are for Verant on this are almost all below 25th level and non-clerics.  They haven't seen 4 clerics die in a row in 7 seconds from an uber-mob or have their entire raid party wiped out requiring 3 hours of CR downtime.  <P>I wish Verant visited this board.  If they did, they could realize that for a mere $50k - <BR>$100k a year they could hire someone to do player feedback and discussions who was trained in the field.  <P>All the big companies do it.  Verant should compile a somewhat random database of people, offer a screen at login on whether or not the customer would like to be added to a list of potential feedback users, and if they are then have the person hired on as a feedback specialist e-mail or call people and discuss with them possible plans and what they would think of it.  <P>They should be concentrating on making the game more enjoyable so that more people join up and good opinion spreads about it.  That would be a wise business strategy.  But what do they do?  Discover a bug that has existed for 2 years that they have programmed around already (by making mobs have huge number of hp, etc.) and then "fixing" it because it was "broken" without any consideration of the side-effects, then telling the customers that they will have more fun with it because it will make the game "challenging".  <P>BULLSH*T.  If they contacted a bunch of the lvl 50+ crowd that played clerics and asked 100 of them (cross-server and a random selection to insure a good feedback) the following : "if we were to fix a bug that made it so when you cast complete heal on a warrior that's tanking the mob aggroes on you so bad that 10 warriors cannot taunt it off you, would you find the game more challenging and interesting?" I GUARANTEE you that 99% - 100% of the clerics would say hell no or that they would straight out quit or switch to different characters if that happened.  <P>This game has so much potential, but their management decisions really are borderline retarded at times.  Every so often I am simply amazed at the decisions they make.  Literally, I am dumbfounded.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000123&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>No, this is wrong.  If you play any game, the basic rules never change.  If you get a spell, it will always do a set range of damage based on your abilities.  If you get jboots, they always probide the same effect.  If you fall 200 feet, you will take the same rule of damage based on your encumberance.  These are static effects which should not change.<P>You know if you swim underwater and run out of air, you will take damage, drown, and die.<P>If you killed Droga 6billion times, and won 6billion times, and then suddenly Droga kicks your butt forever, how is that to be explained?  Did Droga suddenly become a god?<P>I think the dynamic world is a cool idea, but verant's vision doesn't match the ideal.<BR>By dynamic -- the creatures are unchanging.  If Sir Lanthin hits for 90 damage a hit, and after a few months hits for 300 damage per hit, that is wrong.  If however, he begins practicing his combat tactics he could improve gradually to 300 -- say for the first week he goes to 95 damage, second week 100 damage, etc etc.<P>People can't just go from 90 to 300 in one day of game time.<P>You can't just say ok, from today on, the sense magic spell you had is morphed by the gods and converted into true north -- a spell you've never seen before.<P>***********************<BR>By dynamic world -- have the world dictate the changes, like a meteor crashed into the ground and aliens are invading...or gnolls...same difference.  And keep it fluid, while remaining believable.<P>The changes that have gone into the game are too drastic, too fast, and extremely unbalancing to the entire land of Norrath.  Remind me when the game is done with its beta testing.
