</FONT><HR><B>1) You call me this, however, you are the one slandering my name when all I'm doing is defending my position.</B><P>1)	Ok one more time of explaining myself and then I am done… if the shoe fits wear it.  You are not defending your position when you begin to tell others what their position is.  You are insisting that everyone feels jealous about things when they don’t give a rat’s ass about it one way or another that is why you are a jackass.  Don’t try denying it either, you have more then once insisted that everyone is jealous if they don’t like something.<P><B>2) I did not slaughter his view, I just pointed out where his statement of his view was inaccurate.</B><P>2)	Again I am going to call you a name and I will justify it so you can see why.  Idiot is the name that comes to mind.  You are telling him that his <B>point of view</B> is inaccurate?  Hold on here cowboy, isn’t a point of view based on someone’s opinion making it not inaccurate or accurate no matter what because it is based on that person’s opinion?  You are so caught up in yourself that you care not of others opinions?  The basis of this post is to show you that the world does not revolve around what you think.  Get off your high horse for a while and quit telling other people what to think and that their opinion is inaccurate.<P>3)	I will stay away from this one since I am complaining about you contradicting yourself on it.  Yeah you do have a right to voice your opinion but you have no right to tell others that their opinion is wrong/inaccurate.  If you want to be shown some respect then show others respect when it comes to their views.<P>4)	Don’t read what you only want to out of my posts.  I said “everyone <B>should</B> be able to twink if they want to” meaning that not everyone but most people can.  That’s where the word <B>should</B> comes into play here.<P>5)	Um buddy, I didn’t agree on anything on this point.  I just don’t want to argue about what you think on this matter because I respect your <B>opinion</B> to some degree.<P>6)	For starters I have read this whole thread, I have been following it from the beginning and it is giving me a headache the way you try and tell others that their opinion on matters don’t count or are wrong.  Secondly: <B>”This is why many necros and sk's hunt low skels for their bone chips that they need for their pets. Again, if he wants an equal turn at the mobs--INVOKE THE PNP RULES---they do work”</B> I have no clue to which server you play and I rather not know but on my server necros and sk’s do not hunt low level skels just for their bone chips, they offer to buy them from the people that get the exp from killing them for a couple pp instead of infringing on their hunting area.  Once in awhile you will see some high level whack a skel but not normally.  Thirdly: PNP is not a solution to this problem “all” the time.  It states that they must share an area with you not a certain spawn, as long as you both are getting a chance to kill equal amount of mobs in that area it is fair by those rules and most high levels treat it that way too (or so a GM described the PnP rules to me this way).  If you ask if you can share they say sure you can take all these other spawns but I get the (as an example) EXG and Gabbie.  Sounds fair huh, yeah right. <P>7)	Ok another name calling… the word idiot comes to mind <B>again</B>.  You are telling us what Silent Advice is feeling although he has stated otherwise.  Why do you insist on trying to tell people how to think and what their opinions on certain topics should be?  Am I the only one that sees this guy doing this?<P>8)	Ok, going turn this around on you a little.  You said <B>” My admiration of someone can be stated even when I do not agree with what they are saying. Reminds me of what someone once told me: Stand up for your beliefs! You may be right. You may be wrong. But at least you stand for something!</B> so I can not understand why you would be trashing others opinions on a topic when you believe this way.  There’s a difference between standing up for what you believe in and what you are doing which is forcefully trying to convince others what they should think (i.e. everyone is jealous if they don’t like something (sorry, I just like this saying from you, have to use it as an example all the time)).  I don’t care what you believe in but I do care that you are trying to push your beliefs so forcefully off on everyone else.<P>9)	Covered this one and don’t think I need to argue it anymore.  You have your opinion on it and I have mine.<P>10)	EQ is not a perfect world where you can call the cops and have them take care of your problems.  Your lucky if a GM/Guide is even on at the time that you need help with ksers and/or the PnP rules.  Why do you think the high levels take what they want when no GMs/Guides are on?  Because they know they can get away with it and not get into trouble if by chance a GM comes on.  You cannot be banished for not following the PnP rules right off the bat.  I have several real life friends that have gotten 5 warnings total for going against the PnP rules and never have they been banned from EQ for not allowing others to share a spawn with them.  Sure they get chewed out by a GM and told to share but how long you think that lasts?  PnP rules was a great rule system in <B>theory</B> but without enough GMs/Guides being on to enforce these rules they basically do jack for us.  JUST MY OPINION.<P>11)	Actually I don’t think I told you how to think once, I have been telling you to lay off others and quit your enforcing your opinion onto people.  Who cares what you think and I am sure you give a hoot what I think.  The important thing here is one’s opinion and you have been trying to tell Silent Advice what his opinion should be.  I have been following this thread and I know you started off defending one’s right to play how they want and I can care less what everyone else does.  My major point to my posting is to make you realize that you are <B>Telling people what their opinion should be by telling them no matter what they think they are Jealous if they don’t like something</B>.  Get off your high horse a minute and listen to what you are saying.  BTW if your going to use big words, try spelling them right, it’s spelt <B>hypocrisy</B> not hippocrisy.<P><B><I>In the end of it all, play your character the way you wanna play it. Don't climb all over someone because they wanna twink. If you can twink--then do so or dont so according to how you want to play.</I></B> <P>I agree with this entirely but you must remember you can’t decide what someone else’s opinion is on a certain topic for them.  Just because someone doesn’t like something doesn’t mean he is jealous of it.  He/she might just be totally against it due to some moral beliefs, who knows, you don’t so don’t tell them what they really think.<P>Your turn.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Trist (edited October 16, 2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000126&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

Part of this is due to luck I admit but part is also due to excellent trading.<P>You only need one good items (worth 10k or so) to make as much money as you will ever need.<P>My shaman was level 12 when he looted(by right of the kill on a guild raid) an Iksar Beserker Club. I traded this for a TBB. Then traded the TBB for GEB and DW vambraces. Sold the GEB for 12k and the DW vambraces for 6k. He now has 18k and continued to buy and sell large cash amount items and sell them for huge profits. Usually 2-5k per item. Simply because a high level wanted pp for it and I had it.<P>Then sometimes I asked for trades and sometimes pp only. Anyway, I fully twinked out two of my characters in about a weeks time and built up so much pp that I don't have to worry about it for a long while.<P>Not only that, but I'm always getting things and giving them to my friends who appreciate it out of friendship. And when they get some good loot they think I might want, they just give it to me.<P>Three of my friends won't even sell anything unless I'm there to sell for them because I'm lucky and tend to get great deals everytime I start trading.<P>Yes, my highest character is only 32! Yes my second is 30 now and has over 40k of equipment on him now. Yes my secondary is 25 now and has over 35k of equipment on him. Yes between the two of them they have around 35k in pp in the bank.<P>Of course this may be just plain dumb luck, but when luck persists there is usually something behind it.<P>If you don't believe me, come to E'ci and look me up---you will see I'm not lying.<P>Corven</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000128&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

I actually did this once on the boards and the person I did it to asked my why. I apologized. Also, I try not to call anyone anything degrading because I feel it takes away from the intelligencia of the conversation.<P>Second, I did check the spelling of hipocrisy---I am sorry I offended you spelling a word wrong. Yet climbing on someone's back because they spelled a word wrong is kind of a petty thing don't you think?<P>Thirdly, when someone uses foul language in conversation, it shows that they can not carry on a civilized conversation without resorting to petty attempts at humiliating the other.<P>As far as twinking the word SHOULD implies ability, ie they have the ability to do so. I was merely pointing out that there are still new players all the time playing EQ. But I do agree with you that anyone can twink their character IF they take the time to do so. I have taken the time. Many players are too concerned with leveling quickly. The friends that I started playing with all have level 50+ characters now and I have my highest at 32. BUT, I have much better equipment than they do and they as much admit it to me all the time. We are friend and help eachother out all the time. Why is helping friends out a bad thing? (talking about twinking here) Fact is, any help from anywhere that one gets can be called twinking. I had a roommate that received 100pp from a friend then said that I was wrong for accepting gatorscale legging for guiding a guy through nektulos forest because they were worth 1k or so. I roleplayed a guide and was paid for it, he was given the 100pp for being friends in RL. Actually he is more guilty of twinking than I was and I earned my money where he didn't. This is the kind of hipocrisy I'm talking about: saying others are wrong for doing something you yourself have done more so!<P>As to the jealousy thing, I do try and see where another is coming from. Any parent knows when their child is being jealous because of the way they are acting. Jealousy is jealousy plain and simple. Just because someone wants to call it other than that doesn't mean it actually changes that. What I'm saying is quit trying to use a subjective(naming it what ever you want to name it) definition when the objectivity(what the name really is for something) of the definition is clear.<P>If my point of view is inaccurate, then show me where using reason to do so. Blind name calling without reason behind it is pointless and doesn't convince others of anything.<P>I do respect other's opinions. But simply put, and I am just as guilty of it as all others, when you are angry because someone has something at a certain level that you don't have at that same level, that is jealousy. What turns it into hipocrisy is when you complain about it now and then later, when you can, you do the same thing that they did. According to what I have seen on my server, almost everyone has changed their mind once they reach the level where they can twink.<P>As to an observation as to whether or not someone's opinion is inaccurate, this is a point where I insist that some people's opinion is wrong in many cases. Did you know that America supported Hitler in his rise to power? America's support was based on many people's opinion that Hitler would save Germany from their recession and extreme inflation problems. America had the opinion that Hitler would be a fine and noble leader.<BR>Many scientists had the opinion that they could breed childen like they do cattle to bring the Aryan Race into authority over the world (the children by the way ended up dying en masse due to the fact that they did not have the loving touch of their mother).<P>People's opinions are not always right! Pointing out this should not be something to be criticized about. Pointing out truth should never be criticized.<P>Ok, now the PNP rules. What a person has to ask him/herself whenever they find themselves in this situation is:<P>1. Is there a GM online that will be able to answer any petition that is invoked? (/who all gm)<P>2. Is this camp worth the time and hassle that will happen by petitioning?<P>3. Is there somewhere else where you can get just as good experience? (In most cases there are many other places)<P>The PNP rules are not perfect, but they do work if you know them!<P>According to your statement, you have not actually read the PNP rules. If this is the case then you can find them on this webpage or the official EQ page as well. Give them a once over and familiarize yourself with them. I personally have a copy of them in my EQ reference file I have made. This way I can actually quote the name and exact wording of the PNP rule which is in violation. Also if both of you are there for the specific spawn of a creature, like the Jester Skeleton for example, then the PNP rules apply to both him and his PH. Basically the camp you are camping in this case is the Jester Skeleton Spawn. You can agree to rotation of this guy per PH or per him spawning. But if the GM comes, your agreement don't matter. He will invoke a roll and you are both subject to the roll. And yes, you CAN be banned if you refuse to abide by the GM's decision. The player I contested the spawn with was the one that called the GM. I asked him for the second spawn and he said no--he had it till he got the club. I said that was not according to the PNP rules. Anyway the GM came and invoke the roll. He lost the roll. I now had first chance at the Jester Skeleton spawn -- him actually spawning. He refused to abide by it and was almost banned because he threatened to ks the mob anyway. Please understand that the PNP rules DO say that if you refuse to abide by the ruling of a GM then you can be banned for it.<P>As far as the necros hunting bone chips, which is kind of a petty point considering that all I was trying to point out was the fact that any level can hunt any mob they choose, there are many high level necros (or sk's) that don't want to take the time to buy the chips from a newbie and can actually acquire more chips in a shorter amount of time than they can by auctioning. It save them money and time. And it usually dont bring harm to anyone because they like to stop in Befallen where the newbies don't like to be and rake in the chips and be on their was as soon as possible.<P>You said that you didn't think that you told me how to think once. This is wrong. By saying that I shouldn't tell others their opinion is wrong, you ARE telling me how to think. Enough said!<P>At the end of this discussion I find that we will probably still be at odds. I'm sorry for that but I still stand for what I believe in, even if I don't please you by doing it. I hope that you enjoy playing the game and I will continue to answer your posts to me if you choose to do so.<P>Anyway, peace to you and happy hunting!<P>Corven<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000129&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Ack,<P>I TOTALLY AGREE!<P>True, we all have some jealousy that others have what we don't, even if our character would not even benefit from the toy. Fact is, it is a nice toy, whatever it may be.<P>Another fact: Farmers are stingy people who are farming items when they don't need them but simply because they can make money at it.<P>Why do they do this? Because VI don't put an anti-attack prevention on them like they do with some mobs some places that I heard of. What this is is the inability of a high level to kill a lower level mob because the mob is level restricted. I think this is dealing with GM-inhabited mobs in GM events. I'm not real sure on this so if I'm wrong, I'm sorry.<P>But then we'd be into another problem: the ability of a high level saving your but from this mob when you are overwhelmed. LOL!<P>It is VI that makes the rules here and it is VI that chooses to enforce them however they want to. BUT---you can have the GM's abide by the rules when they are in contradiction to them. How? By knowing the rules better than they do. They are just players like you and me--know the rules and give the GM's a reason as to why YOU are right and THEY are wrong!<P>I have gone after items within my grasp like barbed arms and legs for another character, but ONLY when it is not being camped by another player. I think that if an item is uncamped, then it should be fair game. But alas, some items are more cherished than others and therefore have round the clock, and get this, PLAYER ESTABLISHED RULES. These player established rules are just that--player established--and don't have to be agreed to by you. If you want a turn on the spawn, ask yourself the above questions in the previous post, and if you want it that badly, then, YES, insert your RIGHT to camp that spawn as well and have a GM confirm it!<P>Also making the item no drop leads to another problem that I have explained before as to only those who need them would camp them and then there would not be balanced groups and they would then be unattainable.<P>Good Luck Everyone,<P>Corven<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000131&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Corven –<P>I have said my piece about your argument and don’t want to continue on with it.  I am tired of trying to get you to see my point of view although you make yours well known every chance you get.  Call the name calling what you want, I don’t consider it any worse then the misspelling of every other word you have done.  (BTW just trying to get under your skin, take it easy, don’t let it get to you, and it’s <B>Trist</B> not Tryst  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> ).  Just a little tid bit to close this argument with… The truth is whatever you can get people to believe is true, opinions based on feelings can never be false opinions thats what make them your opinion otherwise it would be refered to as the truth… take it for what it’s worth.<P>Midian –<P>Visit Sol A at night then tell me there aren’t as many Farmers around as we make it out to be.  On a good night when I zone in to help some friends I do a /who to see what our chances are to get a certain spawn spot for them is and more than not there are 15-30 people in the zone, 10 of which are only high enough to get exp from anything in that zone, the 5-20 left over are all 45-55 all farming anything from the EXG, Efreeti, Kobold Preditor, Foreman, Singe, Elemental, to Gabbie only to name the major ones.<P>I am all for what you said about going back and trying for an item at a later level that they <B>need</B> but the majority of high levels don’t need the things that drop off 30th level mobs (and rarely 40th depending on the mob) and only want the item to sell off to others for a great profit.  Is this right?  Who’s to say…<P>As far as going after items for your other characters I see no problem in this.  Heck I have done this many times but I:<BR>a.	Don’t proceed with the camp unless no other lower level people that can benefit from it want it.<BR>b.	Only stay as long as I need to and will give up the camp willingly if a lower level wants to take over the item hunt.<P>I try to be fair to others around me when playing EQ and only wish that some of my morals and personality would rub off on others that play EQ.  It has gotten to the point where very few people care about their fellow gamers and only think about themselves (i.e. farmers) just so they can make a little profit.  I have given up the search for items but only play EQ to be with my friends.  I could care less if my warrior only has crafted armor, standard earrings, standard rings, a couple mediocre weapons at his level because I find more joy out of playing with friends then I do hunting for items and trying to make that 19k just so I can buy a “uber” item (who came up with that stupid word anyway?).  Play to have fun; don’t let others ruin your game for you.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000136&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>On twinking and bottom feeding.<P>Honestly what should I do with my money? I have now 1.5 k pp and increasing in the bank. As a cleric my wisdom is almost maxed. Soon I will be able to go to the planes. I only need one or two pieces to overmax my wisdom. I could decide to accumulate more cash to buy some highend mana items for range slot, which cost a lot of money and the benefit isnm´t that great.<BR>Or I can buy some decent gear for my alternate character.<BR>Frankly I prefer to buy some nice things for my alternate character, than to hoard money for no purpose. Oh yes, I must save 1 k for the sky/hole keys. But beyond that, what for is the plat I got in bank? And it makes no difference if I give money/items to a newbie or to my alt char, both action are twinking.<P>Plat is far from meaningless to me, now. But in about 5 more levesl I suppose it will be. SImply because the fact, that then I have maxed my stats, and what more do I need? Only some backup money for coffins/key buying, but hte rest I can give away to other chars.<P><BR>And Bottom feeding is needed sometime, too. As you perhaps know, non erudite int casters have got a hard time to max their int. A nice thing is the bartskull earring, that drops of the ogres. For being able to solo them, one needs to be high enough to single pull them. That can olny be done, if no xp is received...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000137&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

This is where i note the differences in people very much. <P>Many times with farmers I find we are either forced to call for higher help to prevent KS's or acquire a spawn we don't want and use this to "buy" our way into another spawn (swapping spawns).<P>Courtesy is all it takes.

Probably<P>Will I keep the camp against a lower level person? Well in part probably depends on the camp a fast spawn not likely. A random rare spawn? Heh no i will go wipe out some things I get exp from and buy it from the campers if they don't need it. A no drop very long spawn yes i may sit there but i will talk with those wanting to camp it who are getting exp. <P>Its all about the situation but when it comes down to it.

</FONT><HR>It's not so much twinking that bother me, but the camping by players that don't need/can't use the item for the camping character.<P>Last night while killing froggies with my new troll, I heard a lvl 31 paladin shout if there was room for getting into a Crusader (Ghoulbane) group.  He was told it was full by a lvl 55 necro that was camping it.  Not only can't the camper use it, but he wasn't even going to share the spawn with someone that could.  The necro was obviously either farming for money (pp or $ - who knows) or for his twink.  Either way, if someone at least of the appropriate level and class for the item asks to join he should either leave or allow them to join.  (This happened late last night so even if PnP was invoked it probably wouldn't have been enforced.)<P>Ah, what the hell...most players are just dynamic NPCs to me anyway.  It just sucks they need to be so selfish.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000142&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">
