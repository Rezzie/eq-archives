</FONT><HR>Actually, I have a simple answer for this, and it has worked for me (casual gamer).<P>Go camp stuff that drops good, tradeable items, and sell/trade the items for stuff you want.  I wouldn't even CONSIDER questing for that class specific armor.  So, I go camp the YK for a few hours, come out with 2 YKs and trade them for a set of lambent and cleric armor.. DONE...    I go grab a GCB, and trade it for a full set of Ravenscale and Darkforge armor..  DONE..<P>Another thing I do, is go solo stuff I can easily kill that drops good loot. (Like the SBC), then gate back to Gfay and sell them for 400pp ea.  Rinse and repeat, and before the end of the night I have 4000pp to buy more **** I would NEVER camp for.<P>If you like questing and camping, then have a go at it.  For me, I got 1-2 hours a night to play, so I gotta make my time worth it.<P>I would say that at this point, I have really great gear for my levels, I have 5 twinks of each class completely maxed in gear until planes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000125&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>So, in a nut shell, we are being told that if we cannot play for 50 hours a week, we should not have bought thier game, should not be paying them 10 dollars a month, and should, in effect, purchase a game from another company.<BR>Fine by me. <BR>There are already about 12 friends in my area that agree with me to quit EQ as soon as the Vampire or Never Winter Nights comes out.<BR>The chance to ditch Verant and play a game that is actually fun and not a stress would be greatly accepted by everyone, I'm sure.<BR>Afterall, it is JUST a game, we shouldn't be getting so worked up over how the game mechanics are, since we can't change them anyway. We'll just take our money elsewhere and make sure the name Verant is NOT on any games we buy in the future.<BR>This is not real life, this is a game. The time you put into it should not have to equal or exceed the time you put into your REAL LIFE. Having to camp for more than 2 hours for anything is absolutely ridiculous. The fact that anyone has to camp for anything is ridiculous. An adventure RPG game should be more uncertain and exciting. Know where an item will spawn degregates that uncertainty and makes enjoyability drop when you see 3-5 groups sitting around waiting for that one creature to get that one item.<BR>Granted, for story purposes, a creature needs to spawn in a certain spot, but make the creatures spawn faster adn make the items drop more often. It doesn't take away from the "special cuddly cozy" feeling you get when you have that item, it only adds to the enjoyment of the game when you get it. <BR>On the whole, Verant's policy seems to be "Downgrade everything to stop the minority and screw what the majority wants."<BR>So what if the power levelers get every item in the game, make things easier for the casual gamers, they are the one who will be with the game the longest, IF Verant can straighten up thier act before the new RPG's hit the shelf.<p>[This message has been edited by Skeev (edited 05-18-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000126&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Unfortunatelly imho the answer is NO this game is geared towards the casual gamer. It is infact geared towards the power levelers, the uber guilds and such. Is it bad? Very. Will we continue to play? Most probably. Will we jump on another mmorpg that's geared towards the casual gamer?

</FONT><HR>EQ is not for the casual gamer.  You can't play it for a couple hours here and there and expect to really accomplish anything. And in many areas, you almost have to be grouped to camp an item, and unless something is prearranged, you have to spend much time just getting people together. I wish a game like this existed when I was a kid.... I enjoyed the time I played EQ, but my account is cancelled now.<P>Swordfish the Oceansipper</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000131&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>EQ only caters to power gamers!  This isn't debatable it is completely obvious and say otherwise is a complete insult to everyone's intelligence.<P>For many months I played 6-7 hours every nite including the weekends.  This is 40-50 hours a week.  This is NOT a little amount of time this is a lot of time.  Yet believe it or not it isn't enough time to successfully play EQ to the level limit.<P>For example, Many months ago when rubicite existed everyone I knew was trying to get rubicite starting at about lvl 26 or so.  Since I played a lot and started playing as soon as EQ was released I had a number of people I played with quite a lot and I was leveling with the top players on my server.  I was a rogue.  So I started camping the standard places for rubicite starting at lvl 27 and spend all my gameplay time camping the rubicite upto lvl 37.  (At this point I was the second highest rogue on my server).  So at this time for all my camping I had one rubicite bracer!  And I only got that one weekend when I logged in in the morning and place like 9 hours.  Course the trick here was that I created the group camping the throne room so I was first in the loot order.  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>It was around this time I really decided I didn't like EQ much anymore and stopped playing as much.  Why?  Because I decided camping for items and I mean ANY high demand items is impossible!  This is how I figure impossible.  Seems that in most rare item spawns you can figure with reasonable luck you will get a rare item once every 3-4 hours.  So If we figure that our casual gamer can never play more than 6 hours and we assume that all camps are already established and the new player has to come into the bottom of the list.  You can hope to get an item in 18 hours if everyone sticks it out.  If you are lucky people who are in line before you will leave early or they will abide by the rules that if you can't use the item you dont' get it.  So we might cut this in half and say 9 hours.  And this is if you are lucky.  So our poor 6 hour player will never get any items.<P>Now there is one thing in these assumptions that people might question and certainly was applicable to my situation and that is if you are in the power game crowd on a new server you get early access to camp spots before they are heavily camped.  The killer here is if you are a west coaster or and east coaster.  If you are an east coaster you can get on early and potentially get into an early forming camp.  However if you are a west coaster forget it...<P>So in summary to be successful at all levels of EQ and I mean playing the game from lvl 1 through lvl 50 and beyond.  You must play frequently more than 9 hours at a stretch.  If you play in the 6 hour range you will tap out and be very underpowered at lvl 35.  Your only hope will be the charity of high lvl people in your guild.<P>Ethion</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000132&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Bottom line.  Finding items is fun.  Trying out new equipment is fun.  Playing with different equipment arrangements is fun.  Not having to stare at the same equipment for 10 levels is fun.  Having a purpose for an adventure (like trying to find item "x") makes the game more fun.  It doesn't even have to be MY equipment, cause finding neat equipment for other people is fun!  Items are not the only thing, but does provide a much more enjoyable experience.<P>Since Kunark came out, I have made 4 levels feasting on Burynai, Giants, Goblins, etc.  The regular group of 4 I adventure with has found basically 1 item (a Forest Loop) in that entire time period.<P>Now, wouldn't you think that it might be possible that at least 1 item that I can use might of dropped in that time period?  We warriors love our weapons.  If I hadn't of broken down and BOUGHT an Exe Axe, I would still be using the same weapons I had 18 levels ago.  It is unacceptable IMHO for my character's weapon selections to be that static.  I had hoped Kunark would be a boon to the casual gamers by giving them a real shot at finding stuff without having to wait on some damn list to get in some camp.  Apparently it hasn't.  I guess I will go CAMP something.<P>------------------<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000135&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Very goos post and reply indeed<P>I agree with Gordon. Everyone  can't just get the item they want. it involved luck or such as he stated. just like in real life. <P>I myself rarely even get any item from camping though i so much want them. I still now camping Jboot and yet not even get it. I don't worry much about it as if i want it that much. Rather i follow as he stated, acquire the item through travels rather than plan for it. The last year gaming exprerience of camping and rushing for catching everyone in levels (since i am on the same average hour as the original post if not less) i found now i find the game ALOT MORE fun to just travel, do what i need to do as if i am living in EQ world, either be fletching, walking to town (yes walk not run) to bank or do any other sthing, Pursue quests slowly even it mean of needing high levels of parties to finish it, but most quest at least always have an item that can be acquire even at mid levels alone or that i consider the easy part...<P>If you get my point you will feel the fun of the game. I no longer going to envy others that can play alot more and spend alot more time to the game nor will i envy how good their equipment is or are. I will travel as i am and find the fun of the game as that is what i buy games for. =)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000136&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I agree with SeaOfHoles, one fun aspect of EQ should be finding items one can use (and not just sell to vendors) on a regular basis (even small improvements or tradeable items are welcome).<BR>  <BR>The flawed item design in EQ is that it forces one to either hunt the many nameless MOBs for items to sell to vendors (or much lower levels if you have the time) for cash, or spend hours of CONTIGUOUS time camping to complete a quest or kill a named MOB for highly desirable items that one can wear or trade.  The latter is not an option for the casual player, and there is no middle ground (wearable/tradeable but not stellar items found on nameless MOBs).<P>Put another way, if one plays a third as often over a year (as I have) as a hardcore player playing over 4 months (effectively the same amount of time played online), the hardcore player will have much better equipment (and will have learned alot from all that reading while camping), all else being equal.<P>Equipment is not the end all of the game, but Verant should not deny that their design caters heavily to the hardcore playing style.  We are all having fun with the game, but it can't hurt to improve the item discovery aspects of the game and make quests with more discrete steps and less camping.<P>Frothgar, Cleric of Butcherblock<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000138&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

Going palces , looking, doing, dying is the only way to have fun in EQ.  If you are after items, one question why?<BR> <BR>I have several really nice items, did not camp for a one, and have not purchased them either.<P>Got a Robe of the Keeper, DE Necro needed food and a go between to sell, for help them I got the robe, nice +3 int earrings, and made about 50 pp selling for her whiles she leveled up.  All the while I was doing the local spawn for expierence.<P>Died, not unusal for a wizard, popped back into my bind point, next to the AC in Guk. another nice DE SK, was doing the spawn,  she (always seem to get the women, must be the eyepatch) comes over and says, "oh no, can you bring your corpse back? I'll res you" So I pull me bod back , she res's me and then says "Hey you dont have a tome" Now I have a nice Tome with Silver runes (+4 int).<P>I have many nice items, some I killed for, most were 'Gifts', but I have never camped an item. Not for myself, anyway, I did camp Evil Eyes for a gift to the Magician in the Guild, esp after I examined him and saw him still in clothe armor. Tooks 3 days of killing EE's , but I got him 2.<P>I have several unigue items also, go thte by ....... pure accident. Be running around (can no tdo that if your camping an item), and just 'happen' to run into a mob, or more likely he runs into me. A fight ensues, then I have some neat new item, most I never knew about.<P>Would I like some 'nice stuff', sure. Am I a casual gamer, I think so less then 10 hours a week on, I have a real life, I play to be with my friends.  Will I camp an item, never for myself, but would for a friend, cause that's what friends are for.<P>Are the quest's , and drops, and camping bad in EVERquest? yes.  Will it be fixed? no.<P>Should it be fixed? good question.<P>When the game stops being fun, which has almost happened one too many times, then it will be time to cancel the account and move on.<P>Will the next one have problems? You bet it will.  Will they listen to their customers? Hope so.

I think items should be upgradeable by starting another quest instead of getting the best from one huge quest. For example: I complete a short quest to recieve a staff. I then start another quest and I recieve an additional piece to the staff which in turn give better stats. I understand the point of view from both people. Here is a analogy. When going to school, do you have to go 24x7 to get your degree, or do you take it in small pieces. Granted it can take a lot of time to get the best, just don't make the quest so you only get the best and have to camp for endless amounts of time to get it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000143&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I work the "regular" job, have a son and wife, as well as related responsibilities around the house.  As a result I am quite fortunate to be able to play 2 hours a day during weekdays and 2 hours on 2 off during weekends.  Camping to get an item/mob that drops an item is not a viable option for me because of the present "timer" on some of these mobs/items.  I do not mind putting in time provided it can be spanned out over several days.  In my time playing Everquest, I have resigned myself that quests/camping items are not a viable option due to my "casual" play time.  I would greatly enjoy the chance to experience what the others "non-casual" players have had a chance to experience.  Nonetheless I will not hold my breath for any such changes to be implemented</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000144&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well,<P>I am as casual as they come I suppose.  I would like to re-iterate three points that are at the heart of this whole problem.<P>1. Camping is not EARNING.  IT IS WAITING.  Since when in this world has anyone gotten anywhere in life by simply waiting.  To tell me you sat on your ass for two days, and every five minutes you pushed seven buttons and then sat dormant for another five minutes is in some strange way Earning anything, you are a clod.  I suppose you must be in some unionized manufacturing plant in Detroit and when you punch in you sit on your ass and collect 20 bucks every hour because you 'earned it' just by waiting around for the clock to turn 3pm?  I doubt it.  If you do, you won't be there long.  LOL get real.  You don't even need a friggin brain or manual dexerity to play this drivel.  Try going out and Earning something in RL, then see how you view the notion of camping and earning.  Until then SHUT UP about what you have earned.<P>2. This is a game wherein if you are looking to have 'items' in fantasy cyberland so that you can 'look cool' or be able to fight in a certain area, well this is the means by which you get it.  You must live ONLINE people.  This is nothing new to EQ.  Live it or leave it.  They did not spring this on you overnight!  Since Beta, camps have been reality for Verant.   They lacked the vision to see this trend and failed to fix the coding and planning when it became the lifestyle in EQ.  If you view these items as what they truly are, symbols of sloth and laziness, then you really are not too worried that you still have that crappy (?) totemic armor while that guy has planes garb.  Well, I know what has to happen to get that planesgarb, and I dont want to do it!  I am not bitter, I am not spiteful, and I certainly am not envious.  If someone pulls the plug on this game, those people go back to work at the car wash, and I go back to my career and family.  Boo hoo, now I am not important in RL or in VRL.  What was Kervorkian's number again?<P>3. Rarity and exploration are what you people supposedly crave, or you would be playing some trash like Halflife online or some crap like that.  You have the opportunity to have an infinite number of combinations (fascitious) from which to have your RPG character act out your RPing.  If you don't RP, then I don't count you anyways.  Why are you palying an online game based in fantasy and traditional TSR type creativity when you should be out burning up that competitive spirit in a sport or inventive endeavor.  Play a game more suited to your tastes like Duke Nuke em.  Then you can click godmode and run around with the clones, 'earning' your win.<P>If you are older than 20, please think back to what you were playing about 10-15 years ago.  Now tell me that you are disappointed in EQ and the way it is.  Give me a break.  This environment is amazing.  They have created a 'place' to run around and explore and you don't even risk your life doing it.  And yet you have turned it into an Ebay traded contest for creating the Uber-clone in the best gear and the best camps.  Sickening.  You should be ashamed at yourselves for all this complaining.  QUIT!  Leave the game or help them fix REAL problems like bugs and exploits.  Not belly aching about how hard it is to do something.  You died and can't get your Exp points back? Tough!  Don't do it again or it will happen again.  Spread the word...that area is harrrrrrrrrd!..It isn't easy to waltz in and get the item I feel entitled to since I payed my 9 dollars a month!  By your same logic, just because you pay to watch your baseball team play a game, you are entitled to a see win because that is what you want, and that is what you payed for.  No you payed to see a game that has rules and winners and losers.  Quit griping becuase you feel like a loser.  You are not a loser in my book if you have a level 30 character that is 10 months old, and you still have level 20ish items.  Sounds to me like you probably have a life outside of EQ.  ...wahhhhhhhhhhh!<P>Candy asses.<p>[This message has been edited by raagnor (edited 05-20-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000146&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I still think the basic problem is server overcrowding.  It is basically unplayable at night for a "casual gamer" like myself, for any mid to high level character.  I spend my time in the evenings going from area to area trying to find just one spot where I can get just a little bit of experience "while I am having fun".  It does help that the character I am playing now is a druid and I can move around a little faster but I still end up spending a great deal of my time just traveling around trying to find a spot that isn't camped 3 times over.  If I find that I am still in the mood to play after this frustration, I log into the newer server and play a newbie character.  So basically I have lots of mid level characters and no high level characters.  I have found success at getting items but I usually find something of value and trade it for what I want, instead of wasting time camping stuff, and it is an udder waste of life sitting in the game and doing nothing but waiting for something to spawn, and after several hours log off with nothing.  I empathize with anyone who does this.<BR>I am still playing, but Diablo 2 is coming out in about a month.....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000147&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I think the game can be played by the casual player, and enjoyed, but obviously will have some "complications", such as having to find new groups constantly, as the ones you start with will leave you behind, and you must start again.  The only real "design" problem that I see (not counting bugs, they seem to fix most of those as they occur), is the camping set-up.  No reason I see that, for instance, one specific orc carries a Shiny Brass sheild, make it occasionally spawn on other orcs that level or higher.. same with most other spawns.  If, for role-playing reasons, a certain named NPC should carry the item, which is understandable, then make him appear at ANY of the spawn points in that zone, randomly... why can't these poor devils take a walk sometime.. we are certainly running all over Norrath, at least they would enjoy the chance to see the sights of the zone.. then you've got no more (or decreased) fighting, lists, KS, etc.. you are either the lucky person(s) who came across the right NPC or not.. make more of an adventure out of the game, rather than memorizing times/numbers... remember the pattern to Pac-Man.. play all day on a quarter, but where was the excitement?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000148&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Hehe, great post raagnor.  I share a lot of your thoughts from a philosophic viewpoint.  However, I also have a difference of opinion since I am a casual player and I am paying for a service.  <P>So here are a couple of key points from the perspective of the casual player PAYING for a service.<P>1) Is the power-gamer's money better than mine, such that those who wish to dedicate their lives to EQ are the haves and the remainder of us with real lives are the have-nots - when the only distinction is that they have the time (as raagnor so eloquently put it) to sit on their ass at a campsite?  I know Kunark has introduced the random drop concept (thank you, Verant - a START in the right direction), so someone at Verant realizes there's a problem here.<P>2) Should my (the casual player) gaming experience be penalized at the expense of keeping the power-gamer interested over the longer term?.  There are 2 considerations here, the philosphical and the business.  Philosophically, I say no - I pay just as much for the same gaming experience as my power-leveling counterpart.  From a business perspective, I guess Verant has determined more of it's revenue comes from the power-leveling community, so it must make more "nice" items extremely difficult to obtain to keep this community paying their subscriptions.<P>From the perspective of a customer paying for a service, and not able to take as full as an advantage of the service as others, I feel cheated.  Is that Verant's problem from a business perspective? No.  Can they better structure their product so that ALL their customers can get EQUIVALENT levels of satisfaction from the service we pay for?  Absolutely.<P>As a good example, the Mystic Cloak quest.  This quest is broken up into segiments that a more casual user has a shot at doing (even though the damn Priest of Najena is a pain in the butt slow camp) that yields a relatively nice item.  Bad example - numerous, such as camping the artic polar bear in Everfrost caves.  Not only is it a rare spawn, but there are 2 different classes of player that need drops and the spawn is in the area of an extremely high level, high agro spawn (who thinks this crap up, anyway?).<P>There should be more quests like the former - nice items should be more acquireable through a more complicated sequence of short duration events/camps rather than uber-camps for uber-mobs.  Granted, the god armor and equipment will always come from the uber-camps, but the casual player should be able to acquire reasonable good items (class armor at a minimum) over a flexible span of NON-CONTIGIOUS TIME.  This would definitely make me happier that I at least have an opportunity to equip my 40s level character with something better than what most power-leveling 20s characters are wearing.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000149&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;6&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000977&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000977&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
