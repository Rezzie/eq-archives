</FONT><HR>I strongly feel that Verant's idea of "adventure" is far removed from the general populace's.  A quest, for example, should be one of the most adventurous aspects in the game.  A quest should not only involve danger, but also excitement.  How fun and exciting is questing when you are required to wait around, literally for hours, until a particular creature spawns?  The adventure in getting a quest piece should be in *getting there*, and defeating the mob, rather than the mind-numbing and boring hour after hour camps.  Place the "quest mobs" at the bottom of a dungeon, and severely increase the frequency in which they spawn, and you'll find a lot more people having fun with this game.<P>Verant places "quest mobs" on ridiculously insane spawn tables in their goal to limit the flow of quest rewards on the server.  This is ludicrous.  They feel that the pride that comes with owning an item comes from rarity and uniquity.  This may be true to some people, but the majority could care less.  The pride that people get from owning a particular item is that they succeeded in their quest.  The only feelings that players get from enduring a long camp is relief and satisfaction through perseverance.  In truth, I actually *pity* players that I see equipped with a rare item simply because I know how long they most likely had to camp for it.  Place quest items for "uber" rewards on an appropriately leveled mob, and place that quest mob in an appropriately dangerous dungeon.  I feel *absolutely* no pride in the fact that I camped a quest piece for my Robe of the Lost Circle for many many hours.  I feel pride in being sufficient level to attain the quest piece, and having adequate factions and resources to do the quest.<P>Blah I'm getting off track.  Bottom line:  NO ONE WANTS TO CAMP.  Verant is needlessly subjecting questers to insane camp times due to their own warped "Vision (tm)" and horrible game play design. /em makes a rude gesture at Verant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000050&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Everquest is just what it is named. An ever-quest. What the heck you are questing for I have no clue, I have played the game until very recently since it first came out. After level 20, you might as well start a new character. Because for the most part, and this is not just me but many many players I have talked to say that at level 20, the fun pretty much ends. Everquest is nothing more than a glorified chatroom. As a game unless you are in the top .0005 percent of the population with all the uber-everything, you may as well not even bother trying to get that neat ol' epic item they now have for each class. I mean really, the casual player, or even the regular gamer does not have the time on average, let alone the patience to go kill what is it 4 different dragons for some of the epic stuff like the cleric one. Risk losing the role to the other 5 clerics there because you needed a group of 30 people to kill the damn thing. What fun is that? I remember when they first put the cleric armour quests in. Try camping that boudin babbinsbort gnome in Befallen....now it is easier I here. But I had to camp the little runt for 3 weeks. Why you ask? Because he never frigging spawned....and you had to wait 8 hours to clear his place holder. In a persistant world with an average of 1900 players at any given time except the dead of night. I think it is pretty ridiculous to have to wait 8 hours so a single player can get an item because he/she was lucky enough to be there. Where is the skill in that, let alone the fun. Many a time I have been ks'ed in Dagnor's with the legendary carrier of the PKT. Only to see the as$ who ks'd me auction it off for money 5 minutes later. I do not have the time, nor the desire any longer to try and get ANY of the decent items. It is not worth the 4 hours it takes to get a group because you can NOT solo anything that will even remotely give you EXP for most classes. Then wait for the 10 hours to go by while you camp a mob for an item only to see it never drop. *NERF* "What was that??? Sounds like they just nerfed another thing that allowed someone to have fun instead of fixing a real bug..."<P>My BIGGEST Peeve...the ability of a creature so blatently green to you that you gain absolutely no EXP...yet the creature can kill you so quick you do not even have time to read the "Loading please wait..." text. If the dang thing can kill you so quick you should be able to learn from it...<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000051&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think a false dichotomy is being offered here. Refusal to camp doesn't mean "playing EQ without levelling or getting items". It just means you get levels and items more slowly.<P>Every time you kill a blue creature (or above), you're moving towards a new level. It doesn't matter if you're camping or not. Camping just lets you rocket up in level a lot faster. But there's no prize for 60th level -- so why bother? Just do whatever you feel like doing whenever you're online.  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000052&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I have a number of characters, different races and classes. The highest level is a 27 warrior and I started playing EQ when it was 6 months old. What's nice is I can play whoever I'm in the mood to play, it's a nice variety. I do not agree with Abashi though who says that if you don't like to camp to level you should find friends and roam around. That's a nice idea but people who are grouping are doing so to level and they're going to want to camp. Finding the "roaming party" is an impossible dream I'm afraid. No matter how you play though the most important thing is to have fun. If you're not enjoying yourself you should really look at something else. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000053&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>The one thing that is obvious is that the ones that created this game are mindless dweebs with no idea of what fantasy, role playing, and even questing really was or is. They were probably the same mindless ones who always looked at those who actually played D&D as people who liked to waste time when all you really had to do was camp items and lvl when in fact the true adventure was questing and strolling from town to town in search of adventure. These are also the same people who changed the original enjoyement of the fourth adventure of Ultima into that piece of rag called Ultima IX. This game had the promise of becomming so much more but the mindless dweebs who wrote the game never had the fathom to bring a STORYLINE to the game. Looking back over all the wasted time I spent in the game for the past year and half.. I am ashamed that I let the dweebs warp my own opinion of what role playing was and instead sit there on the assembly line called Everquest.<P><P>------------------<BR>Bilobob - Enchanter on TT<BR>Master of all Languages<BR>Master of Most Trades</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000056&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Roleplay! if you don't toloeplay, it gets too boring. i am levl 31 druid and was in level 29 for about a month. the reason for this is because all i did at that leveel was log on, go to the nearest newbie zone, and hand out buffs. OR i logged on, went to the nearest druid ring, where everyone was asking for ports, and ported them free of charge. if you aren't a class that can help other classes, either make one, or get items and hand them out to newbies. i originally was a wizard, but i deleted him because wizards cant help people in anyway except for ports, while druids can do that plus buff, and heal, and damage shield, and......ANYWAY! the point of this game is to roleplay, is to help others, is to be admired (i must admit, it feels great to be admired) when you have kick ass stuff on you. really, i want to level for the simple reason to get more buffs, and buff people. it's also great to make friends. even though im a druid, i almost never solo. i almost quit EQ for awhile at level 17ish too, dont quit, 29 will come faster than you think. i got from 22 to 29 in about a week in the lake of ill omen. good luck all, and don't quit when things look grim, it's always gonna get better.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000059&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>another thing i have to say. the game does have a story line, but no one knows about it or feels like following it. why in game do i see iksar and humans (PCs) associating as friends? why do i see wood elves and dark elves pating each other on the back saying, "good job" or "thank you very much"? it's because no one cares to roleplay. the game does have a storyline, it's the storyline that players create. Verant thought people were smart enough that they could make their own story about the world by giving them a platform of how things came about. it's too bad there are so many people out there who complain about no storyline while they are doing nothing to contribute to it. do you really think that Verant will come up with something for you? or are you competent enough to do it yourself? those are your options. choose.<P>PS sorry i got a little carried away, and sorry about the typos, can't check my spelling now, gotta go buff some newbies  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000060&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>There are lots of fun things to be done in the 20s.  I would say teens are a little low, but in the 20s you can start really doing the class specific armor quests, exploring all over, and other fun things.  You can do all these things at lower levels as well, but not as much IMO.  There are pros and cons to every level, and honestly, I don't think its more fun to be level 50+ than to be level 30-40.  It just depends on what you are doing and how much fun you have doing it ).  Bottom line is: Every level is different, and you don't "know" a class, you only "know" a class at a certain level.  Even many high levels would have no idea how to play their class again if given a lower level character to play.  So my advice is, play to have fun, and yes you can have fun without "camping," you just have to find the right people to do it with. Ok, enough of my rambling on ). <P>Phyrix Soulsifter<BR>Level 53 Wizard, Drinal<P>Delanion Mortanus<BR>Level 27 Bard, Tallon-Zek</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000061&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Camping does suck, but it's far from the only way to advance in the game.  There are several dungeons that are either empty or very underutilized in the game, and make for a great and exciting "dungeon crawl".  Gather up 6 or 12 of your friends, balance your groups, and see how far you can get.  Some of the most fun I've had in Everquest has been delving deeper and deeper into the Hole or Charasis with a few close friends, knowing that turning back is nigh impossible, and that death may lurk around the next corner.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000062&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>This game has very little content aside from history that has been written, and some slight information about the races that inhabit Norrath.  There is no roleplaying, and there is no real point to the game.<P>There isn't anything you can do to improve it either, because it was designed this way on purpose.  All that matters is if you can see through the smoke and realize this, you stop playing.<P>I tried social interaction, but after meeting too many 12 year olds, and listening to some truly whiney and beggar-like people I got annoyed and stopped trying to socialize and thus only grouped with real life friends and my guild.  <P>I have several characters. 26 DE Cleric, 22 Ogre War, 19 DE Mage, 12 Iksar Monk, 12 Iksar Necro, 12 Ogre Shaman,  I stopped playing once I realized that there wasn't anything different.  I had a good time for the 3 months I played, but that's it. And that's the point.  So if you don't like, I'd suggest quitting. <P>Everquest has the makings to be an excellent roleplaying game, but unfortunately it is not.  I don't suppose blame can be placed, but it is still quite sad, perhaps we will have a product in the future that can truly be considered a roleplaying game, but not this.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000063&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think something a lot of people forget when playing EQ is that it's a ROLE-PLAYING GAME.  This would imply... well, I don't know... ROLE-PLAYING, maybe?<P>I know some people aren't that good at it, but let's face it... camp monster, gets stuff... camp monster, gets stuff.  Sure, this game's dead boring if that's all your doing.  Most more classic RPGs (Role Playing Games) require character interaction, sort of like acting the way you think your character would act.  Even without a base storyline, your character makes his/her own story every time you play them.  It's an interactive fiction.  Simply camping and getting stuff... you may as well play Super Mario Bros if you're going to do that.<P>My suggestion is not just to fight and get stuff (as that is part of it), but to entertain some social role.  Develope a simple personality for your character (how you'd like for him/her to be) and run with it!  You'd be amazed at how much more fun EQ can be!<P>There's my 2 copper pieces.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000064&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

Here is the tip to make you level fast:<P>1.Forget your real life, forget going to mass or paying respects during your lord's sabbath day(unless you think there is no god out there and you just grew from bacteria or a spec of dust). Forget about yourself and don't clean your room, don't even take a bath, or dare clean the dishes and let life grow out from it. Forget about your love ones and just play all day. When you get home from work or school jump right up and take a sit on your comp...log in to eq..."You are in our world now!"<BR>Forget about everything but the game...it is so important that you have to sacrifice a percent of your real life...devoting all to the game.<P>This will level you so fast that you can do 8 more characters to 60. When you get to see a change in your skin color and graying of the hair, then it is working.<P>Then stand in front of a mirror and chant everday..."I am addicted to a game with no sense and end."<P> <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/biggrin.gif">Then you realize how important the GAME is all about.<P>Note: Worship it as a goddess, and when it is your time, the gates will open, "You are in our world now!" <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/redface.gif"><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000067&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think it is simple, I play as a rouge and I think you should have fun. . . Well. . .

I am now level 14 and I sneak around on level 30+ areas and avoid see invis creatures. This is rather fun, too.

</FONT><HR>I found the mid levels the most camp 'free' of all the levels. There are plenty of blues roaming around for levels 17 -35, and most of the dungeons offer plenty of experience for those levels.<P>Post 35 is where the problem, for my game style at least (I love to solo), arises. As for storyline...HA! Practically none existant! Dynamic quests...passible, special events...bah! I found that the class quests where very enjoyable to complete, and that Verant missed the boat there. Many of the items that each class quested for, both from the Temple of Solisk Ro, and cities (like paineel) should be able to be gradually upgraded through further quests! Each of the class specific quest were a bit difficult to solo but not impossible. They are much easier with a group or even a partner. That is the level of difficulty that the majority of player can handle, due to time restraints. And that is where EQ should place most of it current efforts. These 'uber' quest are all fine and good, but give me a chance hand in my shadowbound gloves as part of another less 'uber' quest and I would gladly undertake it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000069&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>  People are failing to realize that most of EQ is NOT scripted. Such scripting (story line) was the LIMITATION of past games. EQ is an open environment. <BR>  People desiring a story line, beyond those presented as quests, are simply people that require greater structure in their lives. A quick way is to avoid taking the easy way.   <BR> Instead, refuse twink-items. Use self-restraint. Resist the urge to purchase you quest items. Instead, let them be possessions that you earn.  What you work for, you will appreciate, more.  <BR>  If you want storylines, then you will simply have to accept new rules, as well, which define the structure. For example, we have the 8-level grouping rule. You can expand this to apprenticeship programs, where your characters must follow a predefined path for advancement. <BR> Twinking would have to cease. Low level characters would be unable to use high-damage weapons, equipment or even possess platinum pieces. NPC pickpockets must be introduced to relieve rich newbies of their excesses.<BR>  High level characters would be unable to use low-level weapons (just as a man, strong enough to swing a ten-stone sledge, would be unable to do any damage with a toy hammer, regardless of his strength). That's right. Damage caps, usage floors (e.g., rampant regulation). <BR>  With predefined story lines, players would be left, either guessing where to go next (think MYST, and ZORK).  Or, NPC's would have to send them on a neverending, succession of quests.  The quest items would have to follow the same guidelines as newbie weapons. They would be NO DROP, NO SELL, so characters could not purchase the items. They'd be forced to get the items, from NPC's, alone.<BR>  In EQ, MOBs are one strength, whether attacked by a group, or an individual. Readjusting MOB's strength, based on number of attackers present, within range to attack, may be a way to lessen dependency upon camping. That way, a player could, conceivably, solo the entire game.<BR>  Truly, what is a quest? Isn't it more of a scavenger hunt? Go get these items and you get a reward? Have you ever considered that locating items to practice your trade skills constitutes a quest? There are many paths, and your skills are improved in the process.<BR>  Many EQ players are either naturally introverted, or physically isolated (e.g., live out of town).  EQ is an excellent opportunity to spend time with friends, without needing be concerned with Real-Life limitations. It helps people overcome their limitations, and have a fuller, more robust life.<BR>  In EQ, sheer force-of-personality comes to bear. You like, and are liked, based on the content of your character, as you choose to display it. Spending time, together, working on goals, together, constitutes a PROCESS. Goals provide a direction. The fun is not in achieving the goals, but in the ongoing process.<BR>  A person that is spending time camping & levelling needs to be playing somewhere else. Such a person hates EQ for its strengths.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000070&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I think you're missing the point.  maybe.  See, it's about role-playing.  if you're thinking like  'camp this monster/item, lvl, camp, blah, blah, blah', then you're not role-playing, nothing becoming your character.  you're metagame-thinking.  when you log on, try being your character.  does gregor the warrior think "oh, hey, if i camp this monster and beat if four times, i'll go up to lvl 30!"   no.  he thinks, adventure, honor... history in the making.  also, developing and interacting activly in a guild can increase the play fun of the game.  Make your mark on the world of norrath, and gain more fun and enjoyment from your game.  my advice to you, is that if you are not having fun in the game, you're spending too much time as 'you playing your character', and not enough time as 'your character.' <BR>just my take on one controversial topic.<P>Nothingman</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000071&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>What's wrong with EQ?   2 prime problems with a fine game which had so much potential.<P>1.   As many have said, Camping is the prime problem.   What the heck kind of gameplay revolves around camping a spot and killing the same monsters over and over?   To me that is the opposite of adventure.   Camp humping just plain sucks, I am the kind of person who  likes to move around and hunt several spots.   Since I move around in EQ I NEVER get the good items.  I am punished for being adventurous.   This is sad.   If anything there should be some way of dissuading camping.   A bolt from the gods if you dont move enough, I mean damn I see people in the same spot for hours?   What kind of adventurous spirit is that?    This game is almost like the Soviet Union simulator.   Sit in line for a few crumbs.   Trying to get a reservation to some of the spawns just kills the whole experience for me.   Really and truly I would like to see good items randomized in their locations much more than they are.   Also, the world is way too small for the number of people you are cramming on servers.    It just kills the feel of the wild when you enter a zone with 80 people in it.    Server overcrowding may help the bottom line but it screws up the gameplay.<P>2.   The game is too static.  I left EQ long ago out of boredom, I returned to play with a friend who was getting a new EQ fix.   I couldnt believe how little EQ had changed with me being gone about a year.    And these events are a joke.   I would like to see one where the "bad guys" win and leave a city in relative ruins.   There is no feeling that your actions in EQ have any effect on the world.  Granted I dont know how to acheive this feeling of impact on the world, it is necessary to MMOGS to keep them from being camp fests for items to impress everyone.    And the answer of just saying "be social", is fine Verant, but that is a cop-out on the gameplay issues.   If people were "just social" they wouldnt have reason to play EQ.  They could do that in much better venues.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001957.cgi&ReplyNum=000072&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Need+to+Level">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Reading a lot of these posts, but not all (since most of them were repeats), I just felt I needed to say something. What seems to me is that lots of the players who posts here, really need variation. These Online Games are not religion, you can have more than one ;-) <P>My first experience with Online games, was.. Nope not EQ, but Asheron's Call. I was amazed about it, my brother had been playing EverQuest for a while, but it hadn't appealed to me like AC did. After 4-5 months with AC, I became bored. Needed variation, started playing older non-internet games... and bought EQ. I had already seen it and tried it out, knowing that it wasn't AC, but it was still a similar game and yet had the variation I needed.<P>So today I play both AC and EQ, a couple of weeks I play EQ all day long, next couple of weeks I play AC. <P>AC doesn't have the same ammount of tradeskills and special skills as EQ has, but it has an ever-evolving storyline, plot, a dev team that works hard *against* camping and make interesting quests, as well as obviously listens to what you have to say. A lot of new features in AC has been added because players wanted it (like completely nuking the worlds largest trade/spam-center ;).<P>Everquest got special skills (like alot of the special ones), more roleplaying aspects (like trade skills), and is group play more than any other game I've played. I've yet to get to level 11+ because I can never pick what race/class I'm supposed to play :) And actually that has made me love AC even more, because there you can choose what skill you want to learn at what level (within certain restrictions of course, 50 skill points ;). If you want to be able to heal at level 1, then it's all up to you. But the games both has their nice parts and bad parts.<P>Turbine is *great* (creators of AC), and that's not what I've heard about Verant :/<P>Regarding Roleplaying. What does this word mean? Aye you're playing a Role. Roleplaying isn't just saying "Thou" and "Thy" (in fact I choose not to), but it's NOT "U need heal?" (OH I really *hate* being called u ;-). Play like you want, but when it's not fun you need to move on. Either you stay in the same game or try something else. Roleplaying is really about playing real life. You don't say "I'm a level 10 IT-Consultant" :-) (or lvl as many say). When I put on that purple color in my name, I want to *roleplay*, as in "I do not know what lvl mean", and "I'm pretty experienced but got a lot to learn still" (Some people are idiots and thinks they rule everything, try roleplay that as level 4 ;-)<P>Bleh I need to learn how to write short posts.
