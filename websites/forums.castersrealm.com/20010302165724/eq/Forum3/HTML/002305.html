</FONT><HR>I am split on this one.  I do think that strategies should constantly be evolving.  For example when pathing in a dungeon is revised and a complacent group is wiped out, I have little sympathy.  However, I do not think that changes should be so severe that complete lines of spells become useless.  I have not been at a major raid since the heal/hate change went in so I can't give a first hand opinion, but if things are a bad as claimed by some than Verant went to far.  I have found thought that many people exagerate when they post so I am not sure that things are really that bad.  Only time will tell.  I have already begun to read posts about cleric working together to create new strategies, but it still sounds like some mobs need to be adjusted if they intend to keep the functionality as is.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Hello all.<P>I am writing this, hoping that Absor/Abashi/Verant Et Al gets a chance to read it.  I don't know if any of VI's peeps visit this board, but I have to voice my opinions.<P>I am an L40 cleric. And I don't like the changes towards heal aggro one bit.  If I followed the aggro posts correctly, there is a pre-50 aggro set and a post-50 aggro set.  Basically, if you are casting heals on a post 50 tank, there is a significantly greater ammount of aggro attatched to the heal.  If you are casting a heal on a pre-50 tank, the aggro remains as it was pre-patch.<P>Unfortunately, this is definitly NOT the case.  I spend a lot of time in Velious, and rather love the zones there.  Cool graphics, sounds, etc.  And I am not laggy as I am in Kunark.  <P>The day I logged on after the patch, I immediately noticed that mobs aggroed me the moment I finished casting even a Greater Heal.  A good example of this was the mini-raid my guild was doing in the Temple of Droga, Kunark.  We pulled 3 mobs, I cast Sup Heal on a Ranger, and low and behold!  ALL 3 MOBS PULLED ONTO ME!  Sadly, they were all low blue, and the ranger was a 44 ranger.  I sat there like a good cleric for a bit, waiting for my tanks to peel off me.  Again, this took MUCH longer than usual.<P>The second time this happened, I cast Divine Aura (perhaps the best anti-hate spell in the game) and watched the mobs still remain stuck to me like glue.  I am amazed.<P>Heh, I was even in a situation where the enchanter had 4 mobs mezzed (AE MEZ).  Now THIS was interesting.  The tanks are working on a 5th mob, I cast my heals, and sit back and watch.  When mez broke, ALL 4 mezzed mobs charged at me, and didn't mess with the chanter at all.<P>Verant, Clerics have enough problems as is.  We play the singularly most defensive class in the game (tied with chanters).  We buff, we heal, we rez.  That's our game.  If you don't know it, clerics that nuke get yelled at by party members for wasting mana.  We are extremely single minded in what we do.<P>The only benefit at all that I can see from having the aggro changes is that I can now control mob aggro better than a L60 tank.  If I want mobs off the chanter and on me, I cast AE heal.  BANG!  EVERYTHING is now on me.  Nice for the chanter (who has a free shot at remezzing mobs), BAD for the tanks who need a heal, VERY bad for the cleric, who will die if he doesn't go invul (thereby negating any chance for secondary heals).<P>I can understand how you believe the aggro needed to be changed.  Sure, Sup heal or C Heal needed to have more aggro attatched to it.  But consider this.  In the time it takes for an L55 tank to do 1k damage, most L50 mobs have done 3k.  I HAVE to Cheal my tank.  So I now have 3k worth of aggro attatched to my name while the tank has only 1k of aggro???  And don't even try to say that a cleric has a higher life expectancy because of the ability to wear plate armors.  I have a 726 AC buffed at L40 (1500 self buffed hitpoints), and velious mobs cut through me like butter.  <P>No Way.  Perhaps I misunderstand how the game counts aggro.  But if my example above is correct, then I am nothing more than a military medic (ever notice how they have a big bullseye slammed across their helmets?  It's a cross, and Geneva convention aside, they are great bullsyes) who has a life expectancy of less than 30 seconds.<P>Verant, clerics are retiring en-masse.  you know this.  IF you don't, you should.  The response to this retirement (as I see it) was to boost the druid/shammie classes healing up so they can compensate for a group that lacks a cleric.<P>Unfortunately, under the new aggro rules, you now force every group (that is going dungeoning) to have a cleric and a chanter in it.  The cleric controls the mob aggro, thereby allowing the chanter to mez mobs while the mobs are glued to the cleric.  This just doesn't make sense to me.<P>Verant, it appears to me that you simply do not like clerics.  I love my class, but you are making it more and more unreasonable for me to play it.  As it stands, a druid with Sup Heal IS a very VIABLE healer and cleric replacement.  The ONLY thing I can bring to a group now is the oppurtunity for rez.  Cheal is nice, but if a group CAN take down a mob without losing life, then a druid or shammie can heal up just as well as a cleric. <P>I am not asking for the world Verant.  I want an explanation from you.  WHAT is YOUR EXACT Vision for the cleric class?  Don't go pointing me to the guidebook I received when I purchased the game.  It is old and outdated.  I want to know what your CURRENT vision is.  Clerics do need changes.  Aggro as it stands is a neat way to slam a target on me.  Yippee.  <P>If you are insistant on leaving aggro as is, then we need to have a better way of defending ourselves.  Clerics aren't tanks.  We are defensive.  I don't go screaming into battle, waving my Wraithbone hammer like a maniac.  I Dodge blows.  Increase our dodge, change aggro back to what it was, and leave us alone.  Every change that you make to us only disgruntles us more.<P><BR>Hegwin Downfall.<BR>L40 cleric.

</FONT><HR>  I have played many a character and have climbed the ladders as far as level 30, and all I have been able to tell has changed is how much players think of themselves.  there are complainers and there are adapters.  VI indicated very early, that Norrath would be an evolving world.  the people who constantly complain of these changes are probably the same players who feel they have the right to dictate what channels to communicate this that and the other thing, or what price is rediculous for what item at the auctions, or what race to play what class and no other... these players are the weak, and the weak will quit or parish complaining.  This will only leave room for those of us who enjoy playing, and will fre up bandwidth.  you are the player in an everchanging environment, not the creaters.

</FONT><HR>This type of question will result in some very biased responses because of each persons approach to the game and what they want to make of it.  Personally, I relish the challenge of being forced to learn new tactics because of the changes required in an ever changing world.  And yes, the world should be constantly added to and changed after it goes live.  If it wasn't being altered or added to in any meaningful way, I believe the gameplay would become stagnant and not worth playing anymore.<P>------------------<BR>Laras Shantar - Lvl 53 Half Elf Druid<BR>Yiniar Shantar - Lvl 45 Erudite Necromancer<BR>Malf Shantar - Lvl 23 Half Elf Ranger</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000013&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>IMHO: changing world dynamics is something which should be done otherwise things get boring. However if it changes an already learned characteristic of a monster for example it would be helpful if that monster's look changed. I know its really hard to change the basic graphics but even with eradic personalities one can usually get a hint there is something different about to happen. We have no such hints in a computer game. Also you are messing with the character's survivability who already give more of themselves for others in this game (again IMHO) at an even higher risk to themselves now. There does not seem an easy answer but...maybe an added personal AC/HP buff spell?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000014&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>This is my first post on the subjects, but ive wanted to for along time. First of all, i know this is hard to admit but really Absor, please take a step back. You say you want to make it so Clerics arent neccesary. Is the way to do this insuring that they die immideatly? I'm a "casual" gamer, but i really look forward to the day i can be higher, and from those who "have really played the high end game" its looking to be quite hard right now. If Clerics are now supposed to be one of the main hate listed groups, ok then give us more HPs, better AC, higher dodge caps or something. You want to make it so groups can go without a cleric, then what do Clerics do? When Rogues got put up higher on the hate list, they were given a way to escape it; when Clerics get placed there we get nothing. I play for fun with friends, so im not part of a guild and dont have 30-40 friends to play with all the time. So when i get up in lvls ill be stuck fighting blues no matter what with my handfull of friends? I have heard you say "I hate when people say "wish we had a Cleric," so now you want to go and negate that, fine.Give some other races the healing to some 1/2 of a Cleric, just like Warriors are now finding other classes to get 1/2 of what they get. But what i dont get is, and im sorry for being a bit mad but its a touchy subject, in this "age of great balancing" how is it you have Clerics marked for being "too neccesary." Its racism, or more to the point, classim. Laugh if you will, you are saying that despite the fact one class can do a job, do it well, and help others live; it should be knocked down and hard to play, even die instantly, just because its class is neccesary. Sure i could go into offensive examples with real-world religious problems, civil rights, or equality movements, but i realize that would probably make you angry, and i wouldnt want that because when you get angry you tend to not listen to good ideas (and likewise to pleas of unplayability). I like the idea of tatics, dynamic changes and needing to redesign how we play on different bases. I do not like thinking that the best way you found to do this ('remarkably soon' after you seemed to get a little angry at the Cleric balance talks) was to make it so that Clerics die immidiatly. That isnt the way to go about what you claim to be wanting to do, so like i opened with; just step back and look at everything a moment. Are you happy  that clerics are dying instantly now. If so, then i would suggest you take away the rogue skill and paladin defence increasing, because that way they can die alot too. When everyone seems to get into their heads that "pleased with how it works" means "players die alot, if not always" you can be sure that something is wrong.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000016&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I always thought that the tactic of "find the tank with the most hps, make sure all mobs unmezzed stay on him, CH him till all mobs dead" was both extremely dull and highly limiting for all players but high-Sta Warriors, Clerics, and Enchanters (in places mobs can be mezzed).<P>This change is a huge boost for Paladins, and I believe we'll see them returning to the high-end game where they've almost disappeared.  It's also a nice boost for SKs who can taunt so well with their spells.<P>The poster who said "clerics get yelled at if the cast DD" or any spells but heals for that matter - was pointing out the exact problem with Clerics:  they were too boring.  Both regular high-level groups I play in were playing their clerics on 2nd machines, since no one wanted to do the job full-time.  Getting up to CH every 30 or 60 seconds and having no aggro worries could be done easily by someone playing their main Rogue or even Enchanter in the same group.<P>Tactics, such as spreading the damage between all classes with decent defense skills, then doing big heals after the fight or before memory blurs, are going to have to be re-learned.  This was used by alot of smarter players early on when GHeal (with its unbroken taunt) was the main heal spell.  Roots, snares and other taunt tactics will have to be relearned as well.<P>There are problems:  this will impact the efficiency of high level group xp gain quite a bit - more than was gained from the grouping bonus I'd say.  Also, Uber mob encounters and quite a few Velious non-ubermobs will have to be retuned.  But Verant will do as they usually do, wait till people have exhausted their ingenuity in trying to win these battles then tuning them down if necessary.  Yes this means maybe quite a few Ubermobs will go unkilled and Uberloot unlooted for a few months.

</FONT><HR>This is a very serious question, but like most questions, comes from the wrong angle so the answer will not get a chance to be right. Of course folks want a changing environment and having to learn new tactics is a way to grow our chars. Dynamism is only one piece, and ultimately it comes back to game balance. And asking if players want things altered in an MMORPG or if they should be fixed in concrete after beta, misses the mark that sparked this which seems to come down to: Wow, clerics post 50 seem to be playing a whole different game than what we learned over the last year-and-a-half; what gives?<P>VI's asserted that players are clever and manage to figure out an optimal strategy. This causes VI to want to update the environment to keep things interesting. This change is a part of that, but since there are really three different envrironments in EQ, tuning is tricky (Olde Wolrd, Kunark, Velious represent almost three different games from a strategic view. Arguably planes can be included but those were conceived to behave very different from conception).<BR> - - - - - -<BR>When we set up something we think is tricky, one or some of the 300,000 + players finds it easy to do. You guys are always able to come up with a way to make things work. You're tricky people. And once the 'trick' is known, soon enough everyone is doing it (or trying to do it). - Alan <A HREF="http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3242" TARGET=_blank>http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=3242</A> <BR> - - - - - -<BR>This is a fundamental flaw in game design in the realm of game balance. In VI's defense, this is incredibly hard to achieve normally and is compounded by the number of choices available (race/class/spell/armour/weapon combinatorial). However, for game balance to have any meaning, there can be no 'trick' to the solution, i.e., no prefered strategy or you see this behavior where one person discovers a way around a 'tricky' area and passes that knowledge on. There need to be multiple successful strategies where there is some downside to picking different ones as well as differing beneficial results (see for instance the discussion where enchanters and clerics are considered essential or you can't venture into a high level dungeon...a way to alter the dynamic is to make enchanter less valuable ala velious mobs or clerics less reliable via quicker death.) The downside to this trick-type of strategy being balanced by altered class conceptions is that we players need to learn the 'trick' in these situations: As mentioned for clerics, multiple clerics all chaining CH.<P>Second point, dynamic equals unpredictable: Bad idea. Randomly and arbitrarily changing MObs' strategies only results in having players try random strategies until the 'trick' is rediscovered. (See for instance Myst where some puzzles may not be able to be solved by evidence so a brute force approach to flipping all the levers can be taken).<P>If MObs behavior adapted over time, even if in quantum steps at patch time, that is one way to stimulate creative sulotions and a dynamic environment. Altering the pathing because players found an exploit is a way to keep the game dynamic (MObs learning about the unguarded flank over time is GOOD), but doing it simply to stop/block players from easily entereing an area is bad (sending in a rogue to scout then bringing in the rest of the group(s) behind the patrol is too successful, we need a static MOb to defeat the Rogue because that is too easy a strategy for players is BAD).<P>Hope this is coherent, but I'm in hurry and RL intrudes. Once over for consistency is all it gets, edits be damned! :-)<P>-Frey</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000018&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>There is one major thing i didnt see on those posts: Verant just made the game harder for casual players why? let me explain.<P>I have the luck to be well equiped and in a uber guild. Well in my case my tank has cobalt set or similar, FA weapon type, dragon haste and not only he tanks better but by the time he will need a CH he had time to build agro realy good and i never seen our cleric agro even once, mostly because that kind of tank will survive all the fight and will take 1 CH when mob is already realy low. Now consider the situation with a average tank dealing under half the dammage, having worse AC and will require twice as long tankage. Cleric will have to CH few times  and the poor average tank wont even be able to outtaunt the cleric. This nerf is directly affecting poorly equiped warriors. So Clerics, you should refuse to play in a group without a tank with at least double jade mace and 1k AC (unbuffed)<P>(this is a disguised tank nerf!)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000020&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>My guild and 2 others, not large..but nice mid sized guilds... we had a nice raid going deep in Chardok and went to pull Korocust.. welp.. we had a learning experience and our 56 enchanter coudln't Mez them..dam, so the clerics healed their tanks.. all 4 clerics, 55+.. were dead in 7 seconds. ALL CLERICS dead in 7 seconds, it wasn't one mob aggroing.. the heal pissed off EVERYONE, they went from cleric to cleric and took each one out in about 1.5 seconds, and with Korocust doing 600s we just got screwed. We then spent a large amount of time with corpse recovery.. I dont think Verant really looked into this change of theirs. If it affected just that mob, and only it got super aggroed. It is annoying but you can work with it. BUT WHEN ALL OF YOUR CLERICS DIE IN SECONDS! THIS IS INSANE! Our clerics are miserable, they hate... its insane to do anything high lvl.

</FONT><HR>"Casual player" is an extremely vague term and tends to mean differant things to differant people.  To some it means limited to 3 hours of play a week to others it means not being in the uber guild on their server.  Someone who has very limited time to play will probably never see an encounter where this really impacts them, in the same way that a change to epic weapon quests does not really affect the "casual player" because the time commitment is just to large for them to even try. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000022&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I am a lvl 40 cleric and have been noticing a big difference in the taunting and heals. I have been camping droga since before the patch and would like to share the differences. Before the patch, I would cast one CH and occasionally get taunted on in the same fight. Cast 2 CH's and was difficult to get the mobs off the healer. Sup heal was no taunt (at this lvl). Now, I don't even have CH memmed because everytime I cast it I die. The taunt is so high that the tanks can't even taunt it off of me and there is no one else to heal me. So yes I found a trick to get around it.. Sup heal (heals 2 bubs of health at this lvl on a warrior)and at least the tanks can taunt it off of me. Also to many sup heals and they can aggro the same way. I died 5 times in 2 nights. I am not sure how it is for higher lvl players, but I don't know what I am going to do when sup heal doesn't do much to a tank in the near future. I understand that the cleric's heals should taunt but at my lvl a CH is death everytime. For me this is the end of clerics.. I am not a tank, this was not fun for me and I am seriously considering a change.. Also about what Alan said 'There are some tactics that clerics can learn from wizards here too" I disagree.. A wizzy can time his nuke so not to aggro, a cleric has to heal when a group member is dieing. That is the clerics responsibiity.. or others will get (and have gotten) very upset with the cleric if they die. Now this responsibility has become that more difficult. Sometimes by what the VI reps say, I think the the people making these decisions and the reps don't even play the characters they are affecting or stating things about. To a player that plays a charater everyday some things stated from reps sounds almost ignorant at times.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000023&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I play a lvl 55 cleric and other twinks (ranging 12 to 46 in lvls).  I did play the day after the patch.  I have not playied since.  The change in argo was to drastic all at one time.  The game didnt evole it CHANGED. <P> Yes the game should evole but like a catapiler into a butterfly.  There was NO evolution in what you did.  What you did was change/alter the game drasticly.<P>With the changes that are made I dont want to play the game as the char I started.  Yes I want to play still BUT then I think of all the time I WASTED.  So it's harder to 'start over' and frankly I dont want to.  <P>I ask you this.  If a mob(s) can just realize 'this guys heals and keeps what I'm hitting from dieing'.  Then why the PC chars do the same?  Clerics sit and watch Warriors all day long why cant they learn the same skills?  I can tell you.  It changes the game.  It does not evole it CHANGES like you did with the argo.  It might have been a bug that needed to be fixed but you could have 'eased' it into the game.  <P>You asked should the game evole.  Yes it should but it should not be changed/altered drasticly.  What you did was very wrong in 'how' you did it.  Thats not saying it shouldnt have happened but just not like it did.  I now have to learn what class I chose COMPLETLY OVER.  I spent since realse doing/learing and in one patch you made what I know useless (to me atleast).  Makeing what I know wrong means I have to relearn before I become good again.  I dont want to do that.  I dont have the need to do that.  I wont do that.  <P><BR>At one time a very loved cleric <BR>Now a very hurt cleric</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000024&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 5 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/002305-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/002305-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/002305-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/002305-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/002305-5.html">5</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=002305&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=002305&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
