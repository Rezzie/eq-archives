</FONT><HR>Welcome one and all to a super special triple release of the Shadow Falls. I am releasing 3 Chapters today to celebrate me becoming a guide on Fennin Ro(P.S. send me a tell in a while. I am Guide Chroino) In today's release you are getting 11 The Long March, Ch 12 Call of the Hero, and Chapter 13 The Tie that Binds.<P>Dont forget to post your thoughts feelings and comments!<P>Enjoy!<BR>------------------<P><BR>-------------------<BR>Ch 11 The Long March<BR>-------------------<P>"This isn’t a very good report Karasir."<P>"I am sorry M’lord. Raziel’s progress is outstanding, but it is that progress which could hurt us. Our runners indicate he has gained a following of around 12,000. But he has been plagued by attacks by the ever-increasing numbers of the undead. If they’re not against him they are against a nearby city or village, all these factors are detaining him from returning. Which is distarous, for the Selquinox is only 3 days away."<P>"How about your own troops, Karasir?"<P>"What is left of the battalions and the locals that have joined us number 20,000. But the number is falling. The longer we wait and patrol the areas, the more number we lose and the more the undead gain. I believe we should attack now and keep the Dark Elves from completing the ritual."<P>" I wish we had more time to wait for Raziel’s mercenaries, but your right Karasir. March for Dagnor’s Cauldron"<P>"Yes M’lord"<BR>-----------------------<P><BR>Unaware of the mounting forces in the northern lands, Raziel’s mercenary army, now called by locals The Grudgebringers, defends a small trading post from an attack by goblins.<P>"Attack! Move up the western flank! Don’t let a greenskin survive!"<P><BR>Arrows flew swiftly through the air, carving through the fleeing goblins.<P>"Charge!"<P>Springing forward the main section of the battle column chased in pursuit of the goblins. The goblins fell quickly under the oncoming blades of the horsed Calvary. With in a few moments the battle was over. The trading post was lightly damaged, several buildings had been lit aflame by the goblins others had dozens of arrows and blood splattered over them.<P>"Thank you so much you have saved us all. How can we ever repay you?"<P>"Ill give you hint, they are small, round, and have a nice sound to them in a chest."<P>"...? I don’t understand."<P>"Think about it..Think hard."<P>"O! Yes of course your army will be well compensated."<P>"Good." Raziel turned towards the army. "Men rest and enjoy yourself while you can. We march in 3 hours." <BR>---------------------------<P><BR>"Hey what’s wrong Ar? Why the long face?......"<P>"Nothing.......sigh....."<P>"OOO. I know what’s wrong. Ar’s got a crush! Ar’s got a crush! Ar’s got a crush!"<P>"I do not!!.......no...your right....."<P>"Name a time I have been wrong."<P>"We.."<P>"Don’t answer that. So...who is it?"<P>"Like Im going to you Mia, miss blabber mouth."<P>"UH! That hurts. I’m feel so hurt that you don’t trust me. O well I can guess...O I know it’s Karasir. Well who wouldnt like him?"<P>"nope."<P>"Morgann?"<P>"no"<P>"Raziel?"<P>"......no"<P>"AH HAH!!! I knew it! When did you fall for him?"<P><BR>"...I guess I’ve always ...but I didnt realize it until 2 weeks ago, just before he left to gather the merc army"<BR>---------------------------------<P><BR>"So when are we leaving for the southern lands?"<P>"We are not. I am going to the southern territory."<P>"Why are you leaving me?"<P>"I have my reasons. Now go inside."<P>"No."<P>"Dont be stubborn. Go inside and go practice your sword skills"<P>"Is that why your leaving me behind, because you think I am too weak?"<P>Arorua quickly punches in the shoulder.<P>"OW! Stop that!" He  rubs his sore shoulder.  "That’s not the reason, though one reason is that you keep beating on me. "<P>"O your such a wimp, I don’t hit you that hard."<P>"Tell my bruises that."<P>"Such a big baby"<P>"Yep. C’ya later" He turns to leave.<P>"HEY! Come back here and tell me why."<P>"Alright, alright. The reason is... the upcoming battles we are going to be facin will result in the deaths of hundreds...I don’t want you to join them.. Intelligence, skill, and beauty are rare comidities in this world. It’s even more precious when one person is imbued with all of them."<P>"...."<P><BR>He steps back toward her and holds her tight in his arms. " I dont want any harm to come to you." He  kisses her for a few precious moments, then lets go and heads out the gates.<P>"Raziel........"<BR>-------------------------<P><BR>"Wow."<P>"Yeah. I know."<P>A page enters the castle village and begins to annouce a message.<P>"Attention all those enlisted in the ranks of Felwithe! You are to report to the castle immediatly! The King has decreed that we will stand still no longer, the troops are marching to destroy the undead threat. Once again, if you have enlisted report to the castle at once for arming!"<P>"So the time has come."<P>"Yeah. Lets head to the castle."<BR>----------------------------<P>"You wished to see me M’lord Karasir?"<P>"Yes, Arorua. I have summoned you here, to answer a few questions for me."<P>"Yes sir"<P>"Please skip the formalities. Now the first question. You have been assisting Raziel since he has arrived in this area, what do you think of his character?"<P>"I feel that he is good man, he has done so much for us and is continuing to do so much for us. I feel that he is a valuable asset to us."<P>"Good. That is all I wanted to here then. I just wanted to be sure your heart and your head were in line."<P>"Sir?"<P>"You should know better, Mia is a terrible gossip."<P>"She didnt!!"<P>"she did."<P>"Why i ought to..."<P>He chuckled, then stepped over to the side and picked up a sheathed sword. Waiting a moment, he unsheathed it. It was finely crafted sword, it shimmered slightly. Karasir tighten his grip on the hilt and the sword ignited with bluish white flames encirvling it.<P>"Is that.."<P>"Yes, it the Masamune, one of the 3 holy blades of Tunare. Commander Bernheardt wields the Fiery Avenger, and King Tearis Thex wields the Essence Flare. Each one was forged by the goddess herself."<P>"It is impressive."<P>"Yes it is. It still awes me even after all these years. But how i go it impresses me even more, who would have thought that a blade, enchanted or not could chose it’s owner. Maybe some day, I will tell you that story. Well enough remencing we must join the army and march for Dagnor’s Cauldron"<P>"His tomb is there?"<P>"Yes. If only he had been destroyed all those years ago. I guess we will just have to finish what the ancient ones started."<BR>------------------------------<P>The next 3 days blurred together as the three great armies marched towards each other.  In the Northern lands, the last of the great army of Felwithe faced little opposition as it made its way to the entrance of Dagnor’s Cauldron. But they were soon stopped when a massive counter strike of the undead pinned them against the Butcher Block mountains. <P>In the Southern tip of Faydwer Raziel’s Army, The Grudgebringers continued on constantly plagued by any and everything that could fight, monster and and undead alike. They continued on through the next 2 days making little progress. His army was exhausted from all the constant engagements and the horrendous pace that they were forced to march in order to make make it to Dagnor’s Cauldron in time. Then just before daybreak on the second day.<P>"Undead forces up ahead Sir!"<P>"Nothing new.  Charge! Hack them to peices!"<P>His battered army once again sprung like a cat upon the waves of the undead, but sooner then any one suspected the undead forces went down. And what lie ahead of them was what they had been praying for. Clear open territory, not a living dead in sight. With great happiness, they resumed there march unhalted and by nightfall had finally made it too within 1 hours march of Dagnor’s Cauldron.<P>"Rest well. And ready yourelves for tommorrow."<P>The worn troops slept soundly, weeks of marching and battles had given them a good apetitte for sleep. They slept and slept until midday. Woken not by raziel’s orders but by the famaliar sounds of battle. The army of Felwithe had broken through and was now engaged with the hordes of the undead that guarded the entrance to Dagnor’s. They readied themselves and soon were in formation and prepared to join the fight. But for the first time in weeks they were afraid, the undead they had fought before had never been so numerous. This time the undead outnumbered them 7-1. And the undead had never been so close to their sourcee of strength, The Dread King.  High above, in the sky the two moons were beginning to eclispe the sun and it was quickly getting dark, he would be arriving soon.<P>/So Raziel, this is it. The Dread King, the whole dead damned army. What are we doing here? It certainly isn’t for the platinum or the women that’s for sure. Is it for the glory?/<P>/I dont give a damn about glory. I do what I must/<P>/That’s no answer, why must you do it?/<P>I don’t know, I honestly don’t know. You would think that after coming all this way and with all these men at my back, that I would have some reason. Well, maybe there is one reason, just one.<P>/And what is it?/<P>I live to cheat death.<P>/A good enough reason for anybody/<P>Raziel circles his horse around faces his troops.<P>"Men ready yourselves, in a few moments, we face The Dread King and all his legions and the taste of fear is upon your lips. I say spit out the fear, drive out the dread with bloodlust, wage war on horror. Slay and slay again, and you might live. ........ATTTACK! DESTROY!!!!!    SLAUGHTER!!!!"<P>-----------------------<P>End Chapter 11<BR>-------------------------<P>The great battle has arrived, now the light has a greeater chance of prevailing now that both the forces of felwithe and the mercanary's under Raziel’ss control have joined together. But the Selquinox is now only 1 hour away, will the coalition forces be able to smash the undead fast enough to prevent the ressurection of the Dread King? Find out on the next chapter of The Shadow Falls.<P>-----------------------------------<BR>Preview of Chapter 12 Call of the Hero (MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!)<BR>----------------------------------<P>The final battle has arrived and the armies of the living now wage war against death itself. But they are too slow and what they have feared the most has happened, The Dread King has been ressurected. In the middle of the battle to end his reign the great Holy Grail Lord Karasir is struck down and someone else must now take his place to rise above and strike down the Dread King. And that person is none other then............ Well you’ll just have to find out on the next chapter of The Shadow Falls.<P><BR>----------<BR>Chapter 12 Call of the Hero<BR>-----------<P>"Dre......ad...... come.......s........Dread c...mes........" The unending hordes of the living dead continued to moan as they engaged the coalition forces. The battle was not going well, the dead were numerous and untiring. The coalition fought with everything they had, but they were failing, the dead were pushing them back. They were too strong and with every second they were growing stronger.<P>"PRESS ON MEN! GIVE NO GROUND! FIGHT FOR EVERY INCH!"<P>Karasir, the Holy Grail Lord sliced through the undead with his flaming blade the Masamune. With single swings he brought down several undead, giving some moral to the faltering troops, but the effect did not last. It was over the coalition was dying, every one would suffer, Felwithe, Kaladim, everyone on Norrath would suffer. The troops knew it, and some were beginning to run. Karasir desperately tried to think of something to boost moral to get his troops back into fighting form, they didn’t have much time left, they had to get inside Dagnor’s Cauldron and stop the resurrection of the Dread King. It seemed as if Tunare was on his side.<P>"FIRE!" A voice echoed over the countryside, then followed by a loud whistling noise. Karasir didn’t have a chance to prepare himself as several flaming objects flew over him and crashed into the undead line and exploded, ripping the dead into shreds and incinerating them. He looked back, and saw hope. Raziel’s army had made it just in time; his army was a blessing. <P>"FIRE!" Gnomes in his army quickly scurried away from some large clockwork machines and then large bursts of flame erupted from the clockworks followed by the same boom. More flaming balls soared through the air and smashed into the undead lines. <P>"CHARGE!"<P>The mercenaries charged forward, all in a loud roar. Moral soared in the coalition and those that had given up hope resumed the fight with increased vigor. The mercenary army rumbled to towards the undead and had it not been impossible, it could have been said the emotionless undead were actually afraid. <P>All three armies were now interlocked. Blades meet rotting flesh, magic ripped though death, and finally for the first time. The undead were now being pushed back.<P>In the midst of the battle, Raziel and Karasir were now back to back intertwined with undead hordes.<P>"I take it you were going to try to win this without me?"<P>"I wouldn’t have had too if you weren’t so slow"<P>"Blame it on them, not me. I got here as fast as i could" he said while vivisecting more undead.<P>"Excuses, Excuses."<P>"Will you two boys stop bickering over everything."<P>"HEY!!!! Ar, didn’t I tell you too stay in Felwithe?"<P>"Since when do I listen to you?"<P>"Since I said so!"<P>"Deal with it."<P>"Of all the..."   <P>His sword slashed through 2 zombies <BR>stupid..." <P>1 more was burnt by magic <P>"stubborn things.." <P>He kicks the head of another. <P>"you could  do"<P> He reaches out and rips the arms of yet another<P>"why this?"<P>"Because we need all the fighters we can get, especially the skilled ones."<P>Arorua begins to whisper something into the wind; she brings her hands together sweeping strings of mana together. She shimmers slightly.<P>"Eternal Light!"<P>An orb of bluish light pulse from her hands forming a sphere around them, dissolving the undead around them.<P>Arorua staggers a bit. Raziel catches and holds her. <P>"You ok!?!’<P>"...Yeah.. just a little tired.. spell ..drained me.." She stands back up, a little wobbly but ready for more.<P>"Hey you did it! Look you’ve opened the way to Dagnor’s Cauldron." The group of three had been battling near the entrance and Arorua’s spell and cleared the path, it had also prevent more undead from entering inside to attack them.<P>"Let’s hurry through, we have some time left."<P>They rushed through the winding path and hurried as fast as they could. They ran on and on and after a few moments they reached the other side. Jagged peaks erupted all over the area; it was a grim macabre place. As fast as they could manage, they scaled up and down the peaks until they saw the expansive lake. Several Teir’dal were standing in front of the lake chanting some ancient spell and perverting the winds of mana to their bidding. One of the Teir’dal noticed them and quickly cast a spell at them. Suddenly a ball of ice shards hurtled toward them. Raziel attacking instinctively jumped in front of the ball blocking it from striking Arorua or Karasir. <P>He made no cry of pain, but his sword and his crafted steel armor was instantly shredded, several of the shards cut into him. His blood flowed freely upon the ground. He then crashed to his knees and panted, the winds knocked out of him.<P>"Raziel!!!" Arorua rushed to him.<P> Karasir seeing a chance as the Teir’dal began to loose another volley, leapt high into the air, intent on sending his blade though the Teir’dal sorcerer. But it was not to be; he struck some form of energy barrier and was tossed into one of the outlying pillars.<P>"Karasir!"<P>The Teir’dal sorcerer smiled and began to cast another spell, when abruptly the mana flowing through him stopped, and his flesh began to rot away. He howled in pain, in tune with the other Teir’dal, as the same began to happen to them. *<P>Arorua afraid, looked up into the sky, terrified of what she might see, and sadly she was right. <P>High in the sky, the two moons slowly blocked out the last of the sun. And with a sudden flash, the last of the light in the sky faded away, darkness quickly whipped across the land, and finally covered the great lake. Deep below the lake underneath the island in the center, darkness poured through the cracks and crept into the long sealed tomb of the Dread King. The Land began to rumble and crack and the great lake of Dagnor’s Cauldron began to boil away. The heat was intense, it instantly burned up the rotting Tier’dal, Arorua used all of her magical ability to shield herself and Raziel from the heat and steam. <P>In moments the lake had completely boiled away and the land that was once covered in water now began to rise. All of Faydwer rumbled and shook violently, as the ancient Citadel of Dread rose to the surface. Underneath what was once the island in the center of the lake, was an immense temple, it soon stood high above the rest of the surrounding rock.<P>Then all was quiet. Nothing moved. Not the soldiers outside the Cauldron, not even the undead. Nothing moved in the endless darkness.<P>Seconds seemed to stretch into hours, as all knew what was happening; all knew what was happening next.<P>The silence was suddenly broken as a great roared left the temple, closely followed by a shockwave of energy, which coursed over the land. Smashing everything. Then at the entrance to the Temple, a massive figure emerged. It was over 7 feet tall. A giant skeleton with flesh and sinew dripping off, it was donned in some type of unknown metal armor. It brandished in one hand a large sword and the other was covered in some sort of tattered glove, it appeared to be made of various types of flesh. The Dread King <BR>was now awake. *<BR>---------------<P>The Dread King stared off into the distance and roared. It then leapt off the steps of the Temple and fell several hundred feet.  Crashing into the surface and landing on it’s feet. It locked its gaze on the wounded Raziel and Arorua. It lifted its hand and pointed at them. Mana began to gather at its fingertips. In a moment, a large beam of mana leapt from its hand towards them. Then just as suddenly. The beam has been redirected. And Karasir stood before them, his sword the Masamune at high ready, the magical barrier around him faded. <P>The Dread King looked at him with interest and readied its sword. Karasir jumped forward. "Die you abomination!!!!" His sword leapt out towards the Dread King and cut only air, he whirled himself around the King and went to bash him on the back, but the Dread King was much faster and caught him by the hand and lifted him into the air.<P>With a single slice of his blade, Karasir's arm was detached. He screamed in pain, but was interrupted by the Dread King’s blade once again, this time puncturing straight through his chest. The Dread King lifted the mortally wounded a Grail Lord up into the air with his sword and with his arm still grasped firmly in his hand, knocked him off his sword, careening him into Raziel and Arorua.<P>The Dread King lifted Karasir’s arm into the air above him, and heartily drank the blood the flowed from the severed limb. After having his fill he cast to lifeless husk aside and once again set his sights on Raziel and Arorua.<P>"Karasir!!! Hold on!!"<P>"agggh..........It...looks like my......time...aaaaa....has come...."<P>"Don’t talk like that! We can heal you when kill this thing, just hold on!!!"<P>"Always...the ...optimist........Hold out your ........ hand.....please..."<P>Arorua held out her hand and Karasir picked up the Masamune, it’s flames no longer burning. And placed it in her hand and forced her to grip it tightly. The Masamune ignited into flames once again.<P>"I...knew it.....the blade....is never....wrong....Trust....it...like...I have....protect..it and ..our people..untill...you must...pass it on....so is....the...fate of the holy..swords...and the..knights of the Grail........You..will...do well." Karasir smiled and his heart beat no longer.<P><BR>"KARASIR!!!!" <P>She stood up and faced the Dread King. Tears ran from her eyes. <P>"DAMN YOU!!!!!" <P>The Masamune’s flames grew hotter and out of control. <P>"I’LL DESTROY YOU IF IT"S THE LAST THING I DO!"<P>The Masmune’s flames spilled from the sword and encompassed her, and instead of burning her, created a shining white armor. <P>"DIIIIIEEEEEEEE!!!" Mana leapt through her body, and she surged forward. Her sword leapt out at the Dread King, smashing into his own. Her assault quickly overmatched the Dread King pushing him back against the large pillar island. Her blade sung as it crashed against his, each powerful swing pushed the Dread King further and further into the rock. Her anger swelled more and she leapt high into the air, and unleashed a blitzkrieg of magical attacks, each flying wildly towards the Dread King. Some connected; others missed and devastated the island pillar.  She continues her onslaught and eventually the blasts shatters the bottom of the pillar and sent the entire pillar and the temple on top of the Dread king.<P>After a few moments, the dust settled and she floated gently to the ground. Her chest heaved in and out as she gasped for air. Her strength and her anger were gone, but she had done it. The Dread King was no more.<P>Or so she thought. With a great roar, the rubble and rock flew through the air, and there inside was the Dread King, his armor had been ripped to pieces, but he himself was nearly unscathed. With a sudden quickness, several bolts of energy flew toward her; all slammed of them into a mana barrier encompassing her, but with each blow the barrier faltered. She had no strength left to continue. She fell to her knees. <P>"Get up!!!" a voice echoed through her head.<P>Raziel?<P>"Stand up!!!"<P>She painfully rose to her feet. She heard some noise behind her, it was Raziel. He was on his feet, but his wounds were severe. He was also low on strength; he was in no condition to fight. But he placed his sword in front of him and began to cast a spell.<P>"SOUL BARRIER!"<P>Instantly she felt her strength return, she felt her power growing in leaps in bounds, far beyond what it once was, she also felt like something was encompassing her..protecting her.<P>"Do it! Worry not about your safety, I can protect you from harm. Just finish him off! Destroy him!" Raziel’s voice echoed through her mind.<P>She realized what he had done, the ultimate bond of trust. He had given her his soul to strengthen her and protect her. His strength and his powers were now hers. What ever pain was meant for her he would feel, what wounds were meant for her, were now his, if she lived so did he, if she died, so did he. She was overwhelmed, this was more then just protecting her, this was his way of....<P><BR>She didn’t get a chance to finish her thought as the Dread King attacked. His sword connecting with hers, then his claws raked across her shoulder. She felt nothing, nor did she receive a wound. She dodged his next series of blows and leapt to his side. Her blade swung out and connected, raking across the Dread King’s arm. She leapt back avoiding his swing, then she sent the Masamune through the Dread King’s hand. Chopping it and his sword off.  The Dread King took no notice and hurled more bolts of mana from his other hand. They bounced harmlessly of her, and then she rushed forward and planted the Masamune in his chest. The Masamune flared up and she ripped it straight up through his head and out. At close range she redid the massive barrage of magical attacks against him. The Dread King howled as the energy ate him, disintegrating parts of him.  Soon he was encompassed, and with one more attack she gathered all the mana she could into a single burst and hurled into the Dread King. The ball of energy that now encompassed the Dread King, exploded. And that was last thing Arorua saw.<P>------------------------------------<P>Cheers roared across the continent as the Moons separated and the sun shone brightly once again.  The undead that plagued the land, began to fall apart and finally after all this time were laid down for their eternal rest. Outside Dagnor’s Cauldron, the troops roared victory as they, brought in Arorua and Raziel back to the camp and headed back home. It was a time of great celebration, though there was sadness for all those that gave there lives to protect the continent, the families and friends of those that were lost, had some comfort in knowing that their loved ones had given their all to keep them safe.<P>----------------------------------<P>----------------------------------<BR>End Chapter 12<BR>----------------------------------<P>----------------------------------<BR>Preview of Chapter 13 The Tie that Binds<BR>----------------------------------<P>In the next Chapter of The Shadow Falls, Arorua is formally given the rank that has been chosen for her by the Holy Sword Masamune. And many congratulations are being passed around by all. But it seems that Raziel has a special surprise for her, what could be? Find out on the Next Chapter of The Shadow Falls!<P><BR>---------------------<BR>Music Cue for Ch 12<BR>---------------------<P>First Star. Combat 3 (Music track from Warhammer 40,000 Chaos Gate)<P>---------------------<P><BR>-------------<BR>Chapter 13 The Tie That Binds<BR>-------------<P>Faydwer shook once again over the next few days, but this time not because off death and destruction, it was a great time of celebration. The armies that had saved Faydwer and in fact Norrath all received hero’s welcomes. There wasn’t a city on the continent that was in uproar. Felwithe was no exception.<BR>----------<P>The army of Felwithe began to march at a slowed speed as it the gates of Felwithe became visible. As the army approached, shouts from lookout posts on top of the city walls could be heard. <P>"They’re back! They’re back! Open the gates! Open the gates!"<P>The endless cheers of the populace soon drowned the noise of the marching army out. Thousands of people flocked to the city streets and cheered for the troops. Some of the gnomes from Raziel’s mercenary army that had stayed began to shoot off fireworks high into the sky. Court musicians played loud joyous music as the troops marched toward the castle. At the lead of the column were Raziel and Arorua.<P>"I’ve never had a hero’s welcome before, it is one of the few things we lack in Erudin."<P>"Yes, it is nice...I wish it hadn’t come at such a high price. So many people have lost their lives. So many people who should did not deserve this."<P>"Death comes to us all Arorua. It is true that people died in this war, but they did not lose their lives like some criminal. They gave their lives to protect and save these people, and I know that if they got a second chance. They would do it again without hesitation."<P>"I suppose your right..but it doesn’t make much easier.....Why, was I chosen to bear the Masamune? Why not continue to let Karasir to bear it?"<P>"That is something, you will have to find out on your own. But I could not think of a better person to wield it."<P>"You always know the right thing to say to make me feel better Raziel. You seem to be skilled in many things...that is when you’re not drinking."<P>"Every one has vice"<P>He slowed to a stop and circled to face his army for one final time. The crowds fell silent.<P>"People f this town. Gaze upon the soldiers you see here today. Lock them into your mind and remember them always. These that stand before you and those that do not, have given more, then could have been asked of any one. They have laid down their lives and their souls to protect these lands. They have answered the call of light to quell the darkness. They have faced the face of dread itself and have emerged VICTOURIOUS!!"<P>The crowd roared again.<P>"Now army of light, listen to me one last time.....EAT!! DRINK!!! BE MERRY!!! YOU’VE  EARNED IT!! ARMY DISMISSED!!"<P>The troops now joined the crowds in cheers and began to break apart, going to the welcome arms of friends, family and loved ones. Raziel continued on to the castle and placed his horse into the stables. Arorua followed closely and did the same. Raziel seemed exhausted and disoriented. He continued to the stable doors and stared out upon the city, night had fallen but the city was alit by parties and celebration that it seemed like broad day. Raziel sat down and continued to gaze out onto the city. Arorua sat down beside him.<P>"What is it Raziel?"<P>"It is a beautiful site to behold. Truly worth protecting."<P>"Yes. Felwithe a beautiful city, especially with the celebration going on down there."<P>"I wasn’t talking about the city."<P>"What then?"<P>"Do you really have to ask?"<P>She breathed deeply, she felt herself turning red.<P>He turned to face her. <P>"Raziel......back when we were fighting the Dread King.....why did you"<P>"Use the Soul Barrier spell?"<P>"Yes. That is such a dangerous spell. If I had died or had received a serious blow. You could have....."<P>"I know. But I knew you would win, you just needed a little help."<P>"But the soul barrier can only be used on some one who is means much to you, a person that you..."<P>"love...... I do Arorua. I love you."<P><BR>"Raziel......"<P>She began to cry. In her life, she had never felt this way before, nor had she ever had someone mean so much to her. It was overwhelming; she didn’t know what to do. Raziel helped her. He reached over and held her. Her tears flowed more freely and she reached for him, holding him tightly and kissed him. She felt so happy in his arms, so warm. She held him tighter.<P>"mmph....my ribs...not so tight Ar...."<P>She giggled. "Sorry"<P>She turned around in his arms and lay against his chest. They looked out across the city, lights dancing through the streets, music being played loudly, an occasional firework shooting into the air. Raziel ran his hand through her hair and across her body. She sighed happily, in a state of complete contentment. They watched the celebration gone on deep into the night, they watched as it died down and soon the city was quiet and all the lights and fireworks had stopped. Arorua slowly turned around and kissed Raziel again. Then gently pushed him to the ground.<P>----------------------------------<P>"Karasir will be missed greatly, he was one of our finest. However, what of his sword the Masamune? A successor to him must be chosen."<P>"A successor has been chosen M’lord. The Masamune and Karasir chose me. M’lord"<P>Arorua reached behind her back, grasped the hilt of the Masamune, and withdrew it. She squeezed the hilt tightly and the sword ignited into flames.<P>"So, you young Arorua have been chosen to become our Grail Lord. To succeed Karasir. The Masamune has chosen, so it shall be. The Masamune always chooses well."<P>"Thank you M’lord."<P>"But even so, you still have much training left ahead of you, your skills must honed much further before we can perform the Grail Rites of Lordship. Therefore, for the time being, you will become a Grail Knight, until such day that the flames of the Masamune glow white. Only then while you truly be ready. So, go to your quarters for the time being and prepare your soul for the Rites of Knight Hood."<P>"Yes M’lord"<P>--------------------------------<P>Shied away deep inside Felwithe Castle and with out fanfare, the peaceful ceremony of Knighthood is being undertaken. Inside the small hall, only a few people have been allowed inside to witness the sacred ceremony. On the left side of the hall is Raziel with Reyas on his shoulder and a Grail Knight. On the right side are two other Grail Knights. In the front are King Tearis Thex and his advisors Caerdwill and Morgann. The King stands before a small alter, inside the altar is a pool of water. They wait silently for several minutes, then the doors to the hall open, and Arorua walks inside, adorned in simple paladin robe. <P>/This is exciting don’t you think? No one outside the knights has ever seen this ceremony./<P>Yes, it is.<P>/What is on your mind?/<P>Nothing….<P>/Your lying. You seem to forget that I can tell easily when you lie. We are bonded you know./<P>…….<P>/Your not actually thinking about…../<P>Yes I am.<P>/You have been around them to long. You know it will never work./<P>Never hurts to try.<P>/It could spell disaster./<P>I know.<P>Arorua moved up to the altar and stood still.<P>"Paladin of Tunare, what is your duty?" spoke the King<P>"My duty, is to protect the people and the land."<P>"Who do you protect it from?"<P>"Those who seek to defile it."<P>"And who purifies you and gives you divine strength to conquer the defilers."<P>"Tunare."<P>Caerdwill and Morgann move to her sides and remove her robe. Arorua kneels down before the altar.<P>"As a Paladin, you defend our people and our lands from those who seek to defile us. Even so, you are not pure enough or strong enough to protect us from all invaders. So by Tunare’s will, you will be purified and nurtured into a higher form."<P>The King turns around reaches into a small cubby in the wall and with draws a wooden chalice. He takes the chalice and dips it into the pool. He places the chalice to her lips and Arorua drinks the water. Her body pulses a gentle blue as she drinks it. When she is down the King places the chalice back into the cubby and faces her.<P>"Now, rise young one. Now longer shall you be known as a Paladin of Tunare, but as one of Tunare’s Knights of the Grail." Arorua stood up and a new robe was placed onto her. It was silk with silver lining, signifying her passage into the ranks of the Grail Knights.<P>"Welcome to our Ranks, Holy Grail Knight Arorua."<BR>--------------------------------<P>/Are you sure about this Raziel? The Council will not like this./<P>I’ve never cared what the council thought before, and I am certainly not going to start now.<P>/Well, I’m not going to stop you…Aside from a few minor details, you could not have picked better./<P>Nice to have your consent.<P>/Your welcome…Hey…Do you hear that?/<P>Yes…sounds nice……sounds like Elder Koda’dal… .It’s coming from the old watchtower.<P>*<P>/Need me to translate?/<P>No, that is one of few languages I did study.<P>"Caught by the moonlight,<P>A silent mist, a shimmer in the trees<P>Oh what a night for dreams,   a night of destiny.<P>Others are sleeping<P>So unaware of magic in the air<P>Magic you were<P>just for me"<P><BR>Raziel begins to climb up the winding stairs to the top of the tower<P><BR>"Sweet fascination<P>Though I don't understand the words you say<P>You whisper soft and low,   and I am swept   away<P>Touch of enchantment<P>I tremble when you hold me close this way<P>Drawn like a moth<P>to a flame"<P>He reaches the top and stops just at the door. It is Arorua; she is staring of into the distance. She has beautiful singing voice.<P>"My fate is in your arms tonight<P>Though love is shining in your eyes,   will you be mine   tomorrow?<P>My heart will nevermore be free<P>A part of you I'll always be,   from now until   eternity<P>Deep as the ocean<P>With every kiss, I'm deeper in your spell<P>Love me again tonight,   you are my one   desire<P>Waves of emotion<P>I know that this is where I want to be<P>Locked in your arms<P>With no key<P>My fate is in your arms tonight<P>Though love is shining in your eyes,   will you be mine   tomorrow?<P>My heart will nevermore be free<P>A part of you I'll always be,   from now until   eternity"*<P><BR>"A very beautiful song Arorua."<P>"Huh! O..Raziel..you scared me."<P>"Sorry. Where did you learn that?"<P>"My mother used to sing it to me when I was little..It always used to make me feel safe and secure. I don’t know why..It just always has."<P>"hmm……  You know, so much has happened lately. I have been meaning to ask you something. "<P>"What is it?"<P>"Well, I’ll ask you a little bit later. Let’s just watch the sky for right now."<P>"Ok." She turns back and looks back out into the distance, but this time Raziel comes up behind her and wraps his arms around her. He holds her like this for a while then he takes hold off her right hand and squeezes it gently. He lets go, and brings his hand back to her waist. <P>Arorua didn't pay attention to what he did for a moment. Until she notices that her hand doesn’t feel right, it feels slightly heavier then usual, not much heavier, but just enough to be noticeable. She looks down and gasps. On her finger is blackened platinum ring with a black star-fire diamond embedded in it.<P>"Yes Raziel! Yes, I will marry you!"<BR>----------------------------------<BR>End Chapter 13<BR>----------------------------------<P>Raziel and Arorua are now engaged to be married and everyone couldn’t be happier. In these last few days, nothing but joy and merriment has been spread around. Finally after years of turmoil, the people of Faydwer finally can get some peace. And to top of the celebration, Ambassador/Commander from Odus is to marry one of their one Grail Knights. Can things get any better? Find out on the next Chapter of the Shadow Falls!<P>---------------------------------<BR>Preview of Chapter 14  Best of The Best (Spoiler Alert!)<BR>----------------------------------<P>On the next Chapter of the Shadow Falls. Arorua and Raziel are getting married. And what is a good marriage without a honeymoon? But one the to their destination the boat runs aground and they are forced to stay in Freeport until the boat is repaired. Lo and behold in Freeport they are having a fight tournament, and after a little jesting from Arorua, our hero Raziel is now a contestant! Can he prove his skills to her and to the world?
