</FONT><HR>His point on customer service, the basic thrust of his email, was very good and valid.<BR>I am sure many people have suffered from bugs etc, and have required the help of a GM. Unfortunately however, most guides have very little ability to do anything. Perhaps locate your corpse and summon it for you. However, the only one with any real power is the GM, and that person is only ever on for a fraction of the day. Firstly, the GM's times are US centric, so if you are not a Yank, you are not on with the GM. Secondly the GM is often not available. This is most likely because they are flat out looking after petitions like they should. However the fact remains that it is very hard to get hold of them. The number of GMs in game with real "power" should be increased so that there is near 24 hour access. <P>As an example, we formed our guild just over a week ago. During the process it kind of melded with another guild, so that the 2 guilds became one, and some of us had one guild name over our heads, and the rest another. On logging, our leader lost his leadership. This took 17 hours of petition camping during the following week to get it fixed. Partially because we are not on when our GM is on, and secondly because there was just no response when he was on. THe main problem here was we HAD to wait for the GM, no guide could do it.<P>Late 2000 my character's name was changed without warning. Consequently when I died I came back with a new name and could not loot my corpse. No guide could help me, although they were very friendly and tried. The GM went away for some time (not a bad thing over xmas), however it left our server with noone to fulfill the role that only a GM can fulfill (ie guild problems, name change problems etc). It took over 1 month, and several emails and petitions to finally get that character back.<P>Admittedly the guides and customer support have to deal with a lot of "nasty" communication. People lack politeness in a major way in these forums, and in game to oI suspect.<P>My other complaint regarding Verant/Sony's communication is regarding server downtimes. If they deem the servers need to go down for maintenance then I accept it, for in the interests of their mega profits they would want as little downtime as possible. However they could be a little more communicative about it. As it stands we have to go to their web site and look up two separate web pages, which are a little poorly organised. It would be far nicer if we could receive emails regarding our server, and its downtimes. It would also be good if they could give us a message when we log on that indicates when the next server is going down. Something like the ads for the best of the best that come up when you log on with your character.<P>More importantly however, I cannot understand why they do not do their maintenance in 2 groups. They choose always to do it during a certain time, which happens to be our game time, so some of us are continually paying the price. In some weeks we get 3 nights of downtime, which sucks really if you can only play those nights.<P>If they choose to do the downtime at the quietest time, then they could easily do it in 2 groups. It would be easy to restrict which server you played on depending on whether you had received the latest patch or not. And then you could keep secondaries on another sever so that you don't have to keep missing out all the time. It would not overload the servers, as they do the patches at the quiet time anyway, at which time there is usually 18-20% of the full load of players anyway.<P><p>[This message has been edited by Lunitune (edited March 06, 2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=290&topic=000009.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Editorial+Discussions&TopicSubject=BRAVO!!!+WELL+SAID+SCRAPS!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>very good ideas, very very good ideas, nice points. The thing is i don't think they really care, there's nothing as addictive as EQ out there yet, so as long as they provide some "CS" then people aren't going to get to angry, but players aren't happy with Verant's responses to their suggestions.<P>I know a lot of people who i know in game are complaining about something or other in the game, and chances are they won't bother telling the msg board cos players' wishes aren't often acted upon, most patches are to fix bugs or introduce new items etc.as far as i know, but hey am i wrong? i dunno maybe if patches were discussed more, and players knew exactly what was happening in patches, sure the patch msg might be helpful.<BR>ummmmmmmm... dead end......<P>the class specific forums i think are a beautiful idea go ahead do it straight away i dunno too much of other class ideas about the class balancing so gar, but i'm very disapointed to see enchanter pets not being made commandable. GIve enchanters a few more quests to do. i have checked in recent levels, but kinool goldsinger in the felwithe enchanter guild, does he actually have a quest to give? i've been wondering for almost a year now, please answer. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=290&topic=000009.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Editorial+Discussions&TopicSubject=BRAVO!!!+WELL+SAID+SCRAPS!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>So we all agree with the executive, and I say he has good points. However, my job is working the trenches in a very, very large IT environment, and it's pretty obvious that we're dealing with a CEO or director.<P>In my work I believe in the "mushroom user", meaning that you should keep them in the dark and covered with manure. A customer that knows something about your infrastructure is a dangerous customer. I admit that I deal only with internal clients, who are somewhat more well-behaved than wild customers, but still my company is probably 90% marketing and customer support, and if anyone has those people as a client, I need not say any more. =)<P>I could come up with many examples of telling a client that I would have something done by such-and-such time, then slipping and having the client go to my supervisor, or worse, convene a meeting or conference call to "debrief" or some such nonsense. There's absolutely no reason that any marketing client needs to know that there is a bug with a certain release of AIX which is stopping Oracle from transferring data between servers; the client should just know there's a problem, someone's working on it, and if there's an ETF (usually there's not). They should also know when the outage has been fixed, but as far as the details, it wastes my time filling out that paperwork, making those phone calls and going to those awful meetings.<P>It's just like in the response: we only have so many people and we all have stuff to do. Ask any director here, though, and they want communication, communication, communication. I have to listen to fifteen voicemail reports about infrastructure crap that does not affect me.  "The network team was working on replacing the intranet backbone, and it was a success." Yay, is that why I am able to WORK today with no problems? Maybe I need to meet with the network manager for a detailed report... nah.<P>The managers want to know all that stuff, though, and customers too.  Why?  For managers it's just survival.  A manager is a funnel-point for all the data below, filtering and processing to pass up to the next manager.  If your manager isn't getting his data, well something's wrong, at least in their minds. Therefore we have to report "all is well", but if you do that too much, you're on your way out the door.  So you report on what you fixed, then say "all is well, no business impact".  For customers it's no so complicated: they are just nosy. I know because I am one. If my package delivery date arrives and I don't have my package, I'm a customer-support line's worst enemy. That's because I want to know where my dang package is, and while you're on the phone, what's the deal? Is the driver drunk? Did you hire a team of apes to deliver your packages?  I can be quite unreasonable if the mood strikes me.<P>Knowing what I know makes me be more reasonable most of the time. I know server outages are part of life, even planned ones (currently I am working without scheduled maintenance, which is pretty interesting to say the least).  To Verant I say: upgrade that firmware, add that DASD, install those fiber cards, and lie to me on top of it. Tell me it will take six hours when you know it will only take three. That's what I do.  I told a client I needed to take down a filesystem for one hour, then fixed it in five minutes.  Why?  Because I did not know how severe the problem was, how long it would take to fix any problems, the corruption had crashed the server last week, etc, etc. No reason that the DBA needed to know that, though (although he knew it had crashed, heh heh).  As it happened, I did not find any problems even though it could have been pretty bad. and he said that I couldn't upgrade the operating system for another two months, at least.  Whee, no maintenance windows because these servers never have any problems. Sure.<P>The flip side to my work, however, is this: I serve the client. If she wants 10GB more DASD, well, just give me some sort of justification and I'll do what I can. One clown said to give him "however much I can get", so he got a whopping 1GB. Present me with some sort of plan and it's yours. How this applies to Verant is simple, we present them with plans and they tell us "OK, sure thing, we're working on it" or "Your plan won't work because blah-blah-blah, how about blah-blah?". I think communication is important, but overcommunication is just stupid and wasteful.  I have a job to do, let me do it, and that goes for Verant's dev team. As a certified AIX specialist, if you can't trust me to take care of your server then who?  Same for Verant.  They made EQ and they know it inside and out.  Trust them to have a work ethic and to like their jobs.  I love my job and care whether or not I do a good job, as does any professional.  A guy working at a fast-food place will probably not understand that, assuming that everyone is a work-dodger.  Not me, and I don't think so of the live team.  Quit asking for status reports and let them work.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=290&topic=000009.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Editorial+Discussions&TopicSubject=BRAVO!!!+WELL+SAID+SCRAPS!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

It is extremely well balanced (a very difficult task).  I have not made it to any level higher than 11 yet, but so far I am impressed.<P>As to the issue of customer support, how many of you call parker brothers when your monopoly game is missing a piece?  This is a game!  If you lose some stuff, get some more.  I understand that one can work long and hard for something, and one can become upset if one loses it, but griping because it takes a week or a month seems a little extreme.  One may not like the answer given by customer support, but nothing in this game should be that important.<P>As for the 3 million dollars a month based on fees, that is trivial.  That is a lousy 40 million dollars a year.  Try to hire good people to develop quality software, pay for multiple T3 access lines, purchase and maintain servers, and pay billing and support.  You will blow through that in no time.  I am on an enterprise project that spends 5 million dollars a month and we are just trying to do simple order and supply stuff.  Give the EQ team some credit for knowing how to run their finances.  If you see all of them earning 150K a year and blowing money like water, then you can complain, but I doubt that is happening.<P>As for balancing the game, very few people understand how hard that is, and when you add the intent for it to be a group game, it becomes even more difficult.  I have been reading the class boards, and with few exceptions, there are people who love there class, and people who hate their class.  Are there problems? Yes.  Will they ever all be fixed? No.  Are there attempts to fix the problems? Yes (Two patches since I started).  Will the attempts always work? No.  Will there lways be bugs? Ask Microsoft  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  One of the things I like about EQ is that it is not the class that is important to succeed, it is the person playing the class.  That is a tough act to create in a game.  To so balance it that anybody can beat anybody in the right situation.<P>The only thing I find as a problem in EQ is that some people fail to play the game as a game, and try to make it a power trip.  I have friends that have 50+ level characters, and they gave me some advice:  Don't accept big twinks/money.  Learn the fun of finding out what you can kill and what you can't.  There is nothing neater than finding that next thing that makes you able to do something new.  Starting a new character twinked with stuff you can't get until level 40 makes all the low levels boring.<P>If I were to offer advice on balancing the game, it would be to try and limit the level stuff can be used at, not because it is realistic, but because it DESTROYS the FUN.<P>That is really the purpose of the game:  It is FUN.  Play it that way, and the customer service issue shouldn't pose much of a problem.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=290&topic=000009.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=Editorial+Discussions&TopicSubject=BRAVO!!!+WELL+SAID+SCRAPS!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>To Gravelgut:<P>Great post, and I agree with you completely! Maybe its because I, too, have been designing computer games for about 23 years (I'll bet we know each other <g>), and am totally amazed at how well the game IS balanced!<P>Of course I have ways I'd improve the game too. And I have personal preferences I'd like to see implemented, biased on both my experience in the game and my character. But these are small details. Overall I believe that EQ is the best game I've ever played, and I've played a LOT of them in my years in the game industry and private life!<P>Basically, I see many people wanting to become gods in this game. Fair enough. But would it be any fun if their weren't LIMITATIONS to your character as well? Would you have any fun if no creature could cause you damage and you could kill anything in one blast? I suspect not. Yet many posts sound like they want this kind of power handed to them on a silver platter, or based on time spent in game.<P>An example of this that comes to mind is that there is a thread here were some were complaining that since wizards are smart they should be able to tell one rune of fulguration from another. I described in this thread how since the two forms of fulguration can't be stacked, one can use stacking as a means of determining which rune is which. My point here is that some people want the intelligence to be BUILT INTO their character and forget the possibility that the "intelligence" should extend out of the box to the player himself! That is, if you play a character this is suppose to be INTelligent, then YOU should be intelligent too! It cant just be how high your INT is...<P>Put simply, instead of complaining about the restrictions and weaknesses particular to your character, embrace them! After all, people who fish PURPOSEFULLY use fishing lines which are not meant to be able to hold even the weight of the fish they are trying to snare! Why? Because it is more challenging and fun!<P>Let me put this into an example many can relate to. At one point I ran from orc centurions. When I killed one it was a great experience, because I killed something that could easily kill me. That was level 6. Now that I'm at level 18 centurions cant even hurt me (i heal faster than they hit), so they are basically ignored by me (and me by them). If I was all powerful, this would be true of everything, and I would have no reason to play!<P>Finally, I like to play good samaratin a lot. One of my biggest thrills is to save someone who would have died if I wasn't there. I don't get EXP, or money, and I use up time and mana to do it. Then why do I do it? Because it gives me a sense of accomplishment and pride, and its fun to help other people! This should give you a sense of how there are MANY ways to enjoy this game, over and above just proving your king of the hill...<P>My two centurions...)<P>//== Elfantino ==\\</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=290&topic=000009.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Editorial+Discussions&TopicSubject=BRAVO!!!+WELL+SAID+SCRAPS!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>To Gravelgut<BR>First things first.. Thank you. I have never found a reason to post before but a comment of yours really got me wanting to talk. <P>Your example of Parker Bros and Monoply.<BR>If I had to pay them $15 bucks + a month (I live in Canada gotta hate that exhange rate!) I WOULD call them for the missing piece.  And.. They hopefully would send it.<P>I called EQ Cust. Serv. 3 months ago..<BR>Still waiting for action.<P>My take on the editorial was a request for Customer Service.  Yes he asked for other things also but they all come back to basic Customer Satisfaction.  You will notice in the response by Alan that he sidestepped the whole point of how bad the Customer Service is by grouping it with other sentences so he could respond with " against the rules" instead of admitting it needs improvement.<P>Please dont take this as a attack on you or anyone but I had to write this.. <BR>BTW.. I called Parker bros and told them i had lost my most beloved race car.. the only peice I will use to play the game.. they mailed me a new one.<P>------------------<BR>Nadr A'Kar<BR>Necro of the 26th circle<p>[This message has been edited by MT (edited March 08, 2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=290&topic=000009.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Editorial+Discussions&TopicSubject=BRAVO!!!+WELL+SAID+SCRAPS!!!">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum290&number=290&thisthread=000009&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum290&number=290&thisthread=000009&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
