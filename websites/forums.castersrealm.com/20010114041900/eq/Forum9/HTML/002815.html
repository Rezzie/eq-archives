</FONT><HR>PARVO'S TOP TEN REASONS FOR NEW ILLUSIONS<P>1. Most illusions DO have at least one secondary benefit, if not more.  Think of illusions as LONGER lasting buffs with a fun extra benefit of looking different.<P>2. Many (not all) of us started an enchanter because we saw somebody having FUN with their illusions.<P>3. Unless they are guaranteed to ALWAYS have a group member who can buff their INT/WIS, most people this level are not going to get rid of their INT/WIS equipment because we got a slightly better version of a spell we already have. They have maxed their INT/WIS with equipment long before they get to this level, usually.<P>4. I agree with others that enchanters not getting illusions after 44 is like necros not getting new undead pets after 44. It's silly.<P>5. I am often the person who buys and sells for the whole group in a new area BECAUSE I can change form and faction to travel where they cannot go.<P>6. Some of us use illusions every time we play. I am often the puller and using air elemental form allows me to run across rocky terrain more quickly without taking damage. When I solo, I use fire elemental and feedback to do 20 extra damage each time the critter hits me. Earth elemental gives me extra str that stacks with strength buffs when I need to carry a lot.<P>7. I hate seeing the one talent we have that isn't shared with other classes being lessened.  Bards, wizards, shaman, and necros can all regen mana.  A shaman can lower resistances, slow things down, and speed group members up.  Tons of classes can root or stun critters out of reach of the battle. Yes, mez works better, but where is the fun in being useful for only one thing?<P>8. New illusion models for the illusionist class should be just as important as new pet models for the pet classes. Does anyone else feel like a second class citizen? Is it that we're only allowed to get enhancements that don't take any resources so they can focus those resources on the classes they favor more?  What's with that?<P>9. Seeing illusionists messing with your head when you first start playing this game is a cool and fun discovery.  It adds depth to this world far more than the text the NPCs spew when you type the correct key phrase.  Pranks are so human, that until computers start playing their own pranks, I will never buy the label of "artificial intelligence" placed on any programmed sequence.<P>10. It will make the game more FUN for enchanters and the people who are pranked by them.  This is a GAME after all.<P>Thanks for reading.<BR>-Parvo Dragonspirit</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=002815.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General&TopicSubject=TOP+10+REASONS+FOR+NEW+ILLUSIONS">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

"Others" sounds like a real boob, actually.  Not getting further illusions after 44 is in know way shape or form like a necro not getting a PET.  If you find your illusions to be this class essential, you really need to start over and play something new--anything but a chanter.</I><P><B>5. I am often the person who buys and sells for the whole group in a new area BECAUSE I can change form and faction to travel where they cannot go.</B><P><I>Ummm.  I'm not.  At least not since about 8th level anyway.  I get 43p for a Legchopper.  The mage gets 39p.  Whooptee fricken doo.  I buy any gems my friends need... but that's about it.  Besides, I doubt turning into a bear or spectre is going to top the correct racial illusion + faction buffs.</I><P><B>6. Some of us use illusions every time we play. I am often the puller and using air elemental form allows me to run across rocky terrain more quickly without taking damage. When I solo, I use fire elemental and feedback to do 20 extra damage each time the critter hits me. Earth elemental gives me extra str that stacks with strength buffs when I need to carry a lot.</B><P><I>Hrmmm.  That's all very nice, and I use air and fire for the same reasons... (earth is 10 STR... blah) but how does that have anything to do with not getting illusions past 44?</I><P><B>7. I hate seeing the one talent we have that isn't shared with other classes being lessened.  Bards, wizards, shaman, and necros can all regen mana.  A shaman can lower resistances, slow things down, and speed group members up.  Tons of classes can root or stun critters out of reach of the battle. Yes, mez works better, but where is the fun in being useful for only one thing?</B><P><I>Bwahahahah.  Illusions are the one talent we have that isn't shared?  Bards can play a mana song as long as you stay close to them.  A shaman can regen their OWN mana for health.  Same with the necro.  Wizards regen their OWN mana with a huge recast delay.  We just click our little spell gem and BAM... mana regen for the next 27 minutes.<P>Attack Speed?  44 chanter and 44 shaman.  You know what the shaman is casting?  Alacrity, because they JUST scribed it.  Meanwhile we've been chucking Celerity for the last 5 levels already, and we're eyeing SLTW eagerly.<P>Attack slows?  That's the shaman's area of extpertise... they should be miffed that we are as good as we are at it.<P>Lower resists?  I toss an unresistable MR killer for 30 mana.  Ask a mage about Malicement.  100 mana, long cast time, and it can bounce.  Every spell in my arsenal is magic based, and in 1 second and 30 mana spent I can ensure it's as likely to land as possible.<P>Stunning and Rooting?  I can hold a mob still indefinitely with my stuns.  Tell the cleric to pull that one off.  My stuns take 2 seconds to cast for the LONG one, and can catch multiple mobs.  Yeah... lots of classes get Root.  That's not our class-defining skill.  It's a general spell that everyone but mages get.  And the fact that we pick it up at 8th allows us to utilize it quickly.<P>You want a list of class defining abilities?  Mezzing, Charming, Stunning, Buff Removal, Mana Regen, and Haste Buffs.  Then toss on the ability to do just about any other spell effect needed, though not as well as others (slows, damage shields, nuking, root-parking, even dotting).<P>Illusions are just a perk.</I><P><B>8. New illusion models for the illusionist class should be just as important as new pet models for the pet classes. Does anyone else feel like a second class citizen? Is it that we're only allowed to get enhancements that don't take any resources so they can focus those resources on the classes they favor more?  What's with that?</B><P><I>Second class citizen?  I step into a zone and shout "LFG".  Ten seconds later I'm trying to decide which of the three groups I should join.  I feel like the king is my *****.  If a class has it better than 'chanters out there, then I don't know how I missed them getting PL'd by GMs... cuz that's about all that's left for us.</I><P><B>9. Seeing illusionists messing with your head when you first start playing this game is a cool and fun discovery.  It adds depth to this world far more than the text the NPCs spew when you type the correct key phrase.  Pranks are so human, that until computers start playing their own pranks, I will never buy the label of "artificial intelligence" placed on any programmed sequence.</B><P><I>This has been a public service announcment against artificial inseminatio--err... intelligence.<P>I mess with heads all the time:<P>"Soandso's brain begins to melt."</I><P><B>10. It will make the game more FUN for enchanters and the people who are pranked by them.  This is a GAME after all.</B><P>49_chanter_00 says, 'Hsss!

While Werewolf looks pimp, it's a STR buff for me. That's about it... the melee buffs it gives are great"<P>LOL - "hardly worth casting, outside of" then you list half the illusions we get minor illusion, dark elf, troll, air, fire, werewolf... Sounds to me like you use them more than you realize and just like arguing.<P>Quote 2<BR>"I use air and fire for the same reasons... (earth is 10 STR... blah) but how does that have anything to do with not getting illusions past 44?"<P>You start by saying you USE illusions for the same reasons I mentioned and then ask why would we need more?  Well, for the same reasons we would need more INT buffs I guess... to get better ones or increase the variety.  Like I said illusions STACK with buffs and last longer so I don't need to keep them memmed all the time. This sounds like you are arguing for the sake of arguing.  Please make an actual POINT rather than flaming your opinion.<P>Quote 3<BR>"Bwahahahah. Illusions are the one talent we have that isn't shared?"<P>This was a really long-winded response where you repeated everything I already said while trying to downplay the duplication of capability and didn't list any instances that show illusions AREN'T the one talent we have that isn't shared.  Somebody with sense would have mentioned wolf-form for druids as an argument that illusion isn't unique to enchanters, but not you.  You continue with your arguments which are not actual arguments but opinions.<P>Quote 4<BR>"If you find your illusions to be this class essential, you really need to start over and play something new--anything but a chanter."  <P>Did you even read that statement after you typed it?  It makes zero sense.  Ok, what class SHOULD a person who likes illusions play, Mr. Genius?  You must have been a debate coach back in college.<P>You argue against a point by showing cases where the statement is proven untrue. You don't do it by saying, "Oh yeah, well I think differently."  That is an opinion, not an argument.<P>Last, I will point out that every one of my original statements was intentionally made without using absolutes.  I didn't say EVERYONE started enchanters for the same reason, because that would be untrue.  The fact that so many people are making a fuss about illusions indicates what I said, which is "many people" started enchanters for that reason, IS true. How can you dispute that fact by telling us you didn't do it for the same reason.  My statement is still true regardless of what you chose to do personally.  It's a matter of simple logic.<P>I also found it laughable that you criticized another player who expressed an opinion as "having no life" when you have posts in every thread on this discussion board. <P>-Parvo Dragonspirit<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=002815.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=General&TopicSubject=TOP+10+REASONS+FOR+NEW+ILLUSIONS">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Hexenyen's Top Ten Replies to the replies of the illusion bit...<P>>> 1. They usually have a secondary benefit so trivial it's hardly worth casting, outside of Minor Illusion at low level for selling, Dark Elf for ultravision or Overthere faction, Troll for a very tiny increase to healing rate (4pts a tic instead of 3), and Air/Fire are nice for the lev and damage shield. While Werewolf looks pimp, it's a STR buff for me. That's about it... the melee buffs it gives are great, but if they actually improve my performance in battle, I need to let the lowbies have their orc camp back.<P>I love how the first sentence basically says it's not worth casting the illusion spells, then the rest of the paragraphs shows the usefulness of them.<P>>> Then I'm one of the few. I played a 'chanter because I read about a class that could do everything.<P>Which included casting many illusions I would assume.<P>>> Maybe so, but I'LL take off my damned gear since I'm pretty sure I can count on myself to cast it.<P>As an Enchanter, yes you would because you can cast your own buffs anytime.  But when it comes to the other casters, they won't because they don't have full access to the +intel/wis buffs at a moments desire.  However, I don't mind new intel/wis buffs.<P>>> Ummm. I'm not "others" then. "Others" sounds like a real boob, actually. Not getting further illusions after 44 is in know way shape or form like a necro not getting a PET. If you find your illusions to be this class essential, you really need to start over and play something new--anything but a chanter.<P>Everyone values things differently.  It was a bad comparsion between illusions and the pets of a class; however, it's the principle that counts.<P>>> Ummm. I'm not. At least not since about 8th level anyway. I get 43p for a Legchopper. The mage gets 39p. Whooptee fricken doo. I buy any gems my friends need... but that's about it. Besides, I doubt turning into a bear or spectre is going to top the correct racial illusion + faction buffs.<P>I believe the point of Parvo's statement was that while in an area where other members are KoS, he can change forms to make use of selling/buying when the other members can't.  Example of this would be hunting in The Overthere and most of your group is a light race.  You may be able to sell that leg-chopper for 43pp; however, that High Elven Magician will only lose exp for travelling to the Outpost.<P>>> Hrmmm. That's all very nice, and I use air and fire for the same reasons... (earth is 10 STR... blah) but how does that have anything to do with not getting illusions past 44?<P>It proves the usefulness of illusions and advocates more.<P>>> Illusions are just a perk.<P>And still are considered class defining spells by many people.<P>>> Second class citizen? I step into a zone and shout "LFG". Ten seconds later I'm trying to decide which of the three groups I should join. I feel like the king is my *****. If a class has it better than 'chanters out there, then I don't know how I missed them getting PL'd by GMs... cuz that's about all that's left for us.<P>This reply doesn't relate to Parvo's statement at all.  He mention nothing about having difficulty grouping.  He is asking why they say no to the enchanters, then turn around and say yes to every other class (epic weapons and Necromancer/Shaman illusions (bear and spectre)).<P>>> I mess with heads all the time:<P>Casting a Direct Damage on a mob isn't exactly a prank and attemping to do so on a new adventurer in your normal form probably won't do much.<P>>> Wow. Maybe you're right. It'll be a real hootin'nanny. Oh wait. No 49+ enchanter bothers chasing newbies as a werewolf... they're too busy in groups. While the wizard complains that he should get an illusion.[/i]<P>You assume much for the entire Enchanter community.  I know many enchanters who still like to perform such pranks.  Many people lose interest in hunting in groups 49+ and look forward to such tasks.<P>Hexenyen<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=002815.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=General&TopicSubject=TOP+10+REASONS+FOR+NEW+ILLUSIONS">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>>> We're a powerfull class - keep trying to draw attention to us, and folks are going to start thinking of us like they do necros - whining children who can't handle having great spells without having "just one more thing"<P>Illusions have nothing to do with power.  Being "powerful" is very subjective when it comes to EverQuest because there are so many things to be powerful at.  The illusion situation does not stem from the believe we should have "just one more thing", but instead that we are denied the very things that make us enchanters, only to be recieved by another class.<P>Hexenyen</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=002815.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=General&TopicSubject=TOP+10+REASONS+FOR+NEW+ILLUSIONS">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>IT depend on how to play the game I guess. As far as I am concerned the enchanter is there for two things: Crowd control and general efficency through clarity/haste/slow<P>Illusions are fun. But after I use them 4-5 time each I don't use them anymore unless their usefulness is really obvious (like air elemental when travelling in mountainous areas). I am busy enough juggling with my spells as it is, I don't need more memming and unmemming. <P>Yes fun spells are cool. But I am certainly not going to ***** because I don't get more of them. I am sure Verant has some far more pressing balance issues to solve first.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=002815.cgi&ReplyNum=000008&forum=General&TopicSubject=TOP+10+REASONS+FOR+NEW+ILLUSIONS">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Hmmm.  Guess I should go away over night or I'll miss a string of posts.<P>Okay... I was poking fun at the original "Top Ten" format with my post.  How 'bout I just keep it to the facts and not try to add any levity to my post.<P>I listed five of 23 illusions, also pointing out that minor illusion I used until 8th, and that I think Troll regen is a pile.  I use one illusion commonly, dark elf in Overthere.  Not once did I say I don't use any illusions--I jumped up and slammed down the book at TEN REASONS illusions are supposed to be our "class defining" ability.<P>Throughout my post I thought I made it quite evident that I do not feel we need more illusions.  However all posts arguing against my opinions (if you want facts on a discussion board regarding new illusions, get hired by Verant and go to a tuning meeting--we discuss opinions here) bring up the fact that I use illusions.  Well of course I use them.  The original thread was not <B>Top Ten Reasons Enchanters Should Have Their Current Illusions Changed</B>.  Povar is saying we just have to have new ones, and making HORRID examples as to why.<P>We've got a few useful illusions, and about 20 illusions that might see use once a week.<P>Troll regen is a joke.  I can get back 3hp per tick, or I can get back 4hp per tick.  *yank*  Not exactly what I would call a secondary benefit.  The faction is more impressive to me.<P>And because I mention faction, I'm sure I'll get a screaming string of replies pointing it out for me.  Povar is arguing for NEW illusions.  What illusion to we possibly need?  We had every race by 20th.  After that we get minorly interesting illusions.  But what do you propose we get for 49th that will make you happy?  I'm not about to gripe to Verant, "If you don't give us Illusion: Spectre as a 49th Illusion, well I'll just quit!  And it should have +10 Disease Resistance!"<P>I've got 23 fricking illusions in my spell book.  I don't WANT 24.<P>Povar you said my comment about switching classes made no sense.  I was being sarcastic.  Let me try just straightfoward now:<P>"If you feel that your lack of an illusion at 49th compares (hell, is even in the same city) to a necromancer not having a 49 pet, you should stop playing an enchanter, because you are playing it REALLY wrong.  I mean no malice from this statement--I'm just trying to save groups in the future."<P>I hope that's clear-cut enough.  Illusions ARE a perk to being an enchanter.  They don't even come CLOSE to defining our class.  5 mobs rush my group and start MELTING the tanks.  With a bunch of scrambling, stunning and mezzing, gentle use of charms, no one dies, and we actually defeat all of the mobs.  I ASSURE you, nobody gives a **** if you're a werewolf or spectre while you do this.<P><B>Casting a Direct Damage on a mob isn't exactly a prank and attemping to do so on a new adventurer in your normal form probably won't do much.</B><P>That was satirical humor.  Giving an example that sounds like the subject you are speaking then revealing that I'm talking about something else.  Nevermind.<P>Short and sweet summary:<BR>Enchanting is not about illusions.  Enchanting is about having a ton of abilities, of which illusions comprise a very small, slightly significant proportion.  They are only class-defining in that no other class comes close to the number of illusions we have.  If you MUST direct your typing skills to *****ing about something enchanters don't have, try *****ing about non-slow debuffs being virtually useless on mobs that you don't feel like handing clay blocks to.  Maybe you could find the time to ask for a Lull-line that either doesn't have uber-resist rates, or in non-aggro.  Hell, other classes would even benefit from that.<P>But I DO speak for most enchanters when I say that Illusions are not what makes enchanters powerful.  They are a perk, always will be.  Groups say "LOL cute gnome look" when I use an illusion.<P>They say "OMG how did we survive that ****!?" when I use my "class-defining" abilities.<P><BR>------------------<BR>Xornn Mier'noen, Nameless Souls<BR>Enchanter Apprentice of the Eleventh Circle<BR>The Nameless Server<BR>--<BR>The Enchanter's Bible <A HREF="http://nsouls.homepage.com" TARGET=_blank>http://nsouls.homepage.com</A> <p>[This message has been edited by Eugee (edited November 15, 2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=002815.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=General&TopicSubject=TOP+10+REASONS+FOR+NEW+ILLUSIONS">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Geeesh - I'm so sick of the enchanters that see our class defined by "crowd controll" and have basiclly been brain-washed into accepting this because hey, we are good at it. (Ohh shhhh - don't complain, they will NURF us.)The only way you get better at this is to level. <- see the period, NOTHING you can do in the game increases your skill at this except leveling. (Your level relative to the MOBS level. Oh wait they alrady have nurfed us go try and mez a Chrom in Skyfire.) For those that feel this way, please go park yourself in a dungon somewhere and suck up some exp and leave discussions about class defining roles, including the fun ones, to others. The new spells are a joke btw and the giving of illusions to other classes (that we cannot at least share - as the ones mentioned by Citra, we at least share the illusion if not the trait - ie wolf from we dont get the benifit of a sow too) is just the "slap in the face" to our class. I can think so many illusions that would be so cool. My top ten reasons for the new and more illusions - just keep saying FUN.  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">They are freezing the classes soon, you may want to rethink what you want your class defining role to be as it relates to the other classes and as it stands alone. Illusions are a key for me for post 60 long term fun.<P>------------------<BR>Bezze Beezz<BR>57 Enchanter<BR>Fennin Ro</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=002815.cgi&ReplyNum=000014&forum=General&TopicSubject=TOP+10+REASONS+FOR+NEW+ILLUSIONS">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I still haven't seen any good reasons why we shouldn't have more illusions after 44.<P>Everyone keeps mentioning crowd control and yes, after I leveled up a lot, that is what I spend most of my grouped time doing these days.  BUT, I couldn't do any significant crowd control for many levels, so I fail to see how that was my defining trait during all those levels.  That point is really irrelevant, though.<P>Also, I don't care if others get illusions.  I am simply in favor of US getting more illusions.  I also never said I want the illusion spectre.  You got that from the posts of others and decided to pin that one on me.  I really don't care if I am a spectre or not, particularly if there is no real side benefit.<P>Which illusions do I want?  Well, considering there is an ice dwarf city on the new continent, that seems like a good choice.  Or maybe gnoll or orc form? How about an animal faction booster like Puma which gives cat-like agility, or rhino form to boost AC.  What about Sarnak or Burynai forms?  I'm sure there are MANY choices that would make sense and could be of some benefit.  Yes, I understand there are resource limitations. No, I don't buy that it is impossible. I was a game programmer for 8 years, so I would bet this limitation is coming from marketing more than programmers.<P>In any case, I, and many others, would like to have more illusions.  You are welcome to not use them.  That is your choice.  But why do you insist on denying the many enchanters who want them?  <P>-Parvo Dragonspirit</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=002815.cgi&ReplyNum=000016&forum=General&TopicSubject=TOP+10+REASONS+FOR+NEW+ILLUSIONS">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I like the idea of more illusions for a few reasons.<P>1. they are fun. Remember this *IS* a game designed to be fun. You may not think illusions are that great, but they were a large part of my decision to be an enchanter. I thought that turning into a werewolf would be the coolest thing in the game.<P>2.They have side benefits. Maybe you don't think the +10 str from earth elemental is that great, but I will use it all the time when I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere and don't feel like going back to the bank. To a High elf with base (55) strength I can increase my weight allowance by almost 20% for a half hour. I also like to roleplay with my illusions and get a chuckle whenever I hear people comment about "How could anybody be so dumb as to give steins to a pet"  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif"><P>If you don't want to have those extra illusions to flip through then *Don't buy them* I never bought illusion erudite/dwarf until recently because I don't care for those races. I believe the majority of Enchanters would like additional Illusions as well.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=002815.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=General&TopicSubject=TOP+10+REASONS+FOR+NEW+ILLUSIONS">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum9&number=9&thisthread=002815&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum9&number=9&thisthread=002815&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
