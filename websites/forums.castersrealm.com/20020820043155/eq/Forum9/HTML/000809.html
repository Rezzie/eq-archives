</FONT><HR>I spent a couple of hours testing Entrance with varying amounts of charisma tonight.  We all know that charisma affects the mez line of spells, but to what degree is still a mystery.  Here were my results.<P>Test Subject:<BR>Guard Jendl at the eastern N/W Freeport zone line.  I chose him because I could repeat the tests on the same exact NPC and had a zone nearby.  Also guards have high MR's and Guard Jendl seems to be a consistant level 40.<P>Me:<BR>Level 41 Enchanter with charisma set to exactly 100, 150 and 200.  My intelligence varied (more with 100 cha, less with 200), but most other stats were the same or very close.<P>The test:<BR>Cast Entrance over and over on Guard Jendl without casting tashan or any other debuff on him.  I did this for 3 full loads of mana at each charisma level resulting in around 50 casts of the spell on Jendl per test.<P>Assumptions:<BR>-Casting entrance on an allready entranced NPC makes no difference.<BR>-No other stats effect mez other than your level relative to the npc, the npc's mr and your charisma.<P>Results:<BR>-Test 1 at 100 Charisma<BR>27 resists<BR>26 sticks<BR>----------<BR>51% resisted<P>-Test 2 at 150 Charisma<BR>18 resists<BR>28 sticks<BR>----------<BR>39% resisted<P>-Test 3 at 200 Charisma<BR>17 resists<BR>28 sticks<BR>----------<BR>37% resisted<P>Conclusions:<BR>While it's obvious that charisma has a significant effect on your mez rate the ammount of charisma you NEED is still in question.  Obviously if you can get 200 charisma 200 int you really don't have to worry about this.  But for those of us who are still making decisions on how we gear up, these results might help you decide differently.  I can easily get either 200int or 200cha at level 41, but I can't get both yet.  I admit that the data set isn't huge, but its large enough to base some assumptions on.  Additionally it's possible that a red or yellow conning creature would less easily resist me at 200cha than 150cha.  If anyone is interested in doing more testing on higher level NPC's or other levels of cha I think we would all love to see the results.  Do with this information as you wish, but I'm going to change to a 200int 175cha setup over a 165int 200cha set up for now.  I'll see if this change has any effect on my regular dungeon diving in LGuk and Kedge.<P>Data:<BR>Here are the raw data files if you're interested. <A HREF="http://www.merryband.com/tests/mez/100.txt" TARGET=_blank>http://www.merryband.com/tests/mez/100.txt</A>  <A HREF="http://www.merryband.com/tests/mez/150.txt" TARGET=_blank>http://www.merryband.com/tests/mez/150.txt</A>  <A HREF="http://www.merryband.com/tests/mez/200.txt" TARGET=_blank>http://www.merryband.com/tests/mez/200.txt</A> <P>-Maryinn of the Merry Band (Brell Serilis)<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000809.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General&TopicSubject=my+tests+on+mez+with+varying+levels+of+cha">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Knowing how Verant like to do many of these things, I have always gone by the assumption that there is a certain threshold where the law of diminishing returns kicks in.<P>You will notice that with your test data there was indeed a difference in the number of resists going from 100 charisma to 150, but the difference from 150 to 200 charisma fit within the definition of statistical noise.  In other words, it is not clear that that additional 50 points of Charisma did ANYTHING for you, whereas at lvl 31 50 more points of INT would have gained you over 300 additional mana, which is 6 casts of Enthrall, or 3 whole casts of Chaos Flux for 450 damage, or almost 8 casts of Color Shift.  Those are real, tangible benefits.<P>When I fight nowadays (I am lvl 31) I generally have my int at around 192 (with an additional +100 mana).  I can get my int up over 200, but I prefer to wear some mana items instead of int because they have other bonuses as well (I still wear my gold jaded bracers for example, instead of my PBBs, which I only wear while doing jewelry, and I wear a plat jaded ring instead of a plat star rose quartz ring for the same reasons).  My charisma, wielding my Incandescent Rod and my Stein of Moggock, with Sympathetic Aura up, is around 126.  I can swap in my Crude Stein and my Rod of Insidious Glamour for an additional 27 charisma, but to be honest I haven't noticed a need.  Last night in Cazic I enthralled a LOT of lizards, and I never seemed to have a problem enthralling them, nor holding them enthralled.  I like the occasional Color Shift proc from the Incandescent Wand, particularly if a Shaman will buff up my pitiful dexterity and increase the proc frequency.<P>My strategy is to try and Tashani them first if at all possible.   This is often possible if, for example, two or three lizzies are fighting my group and I stand back a long ways off.  The aggro factor from my Tashani with me standing 75 feet away will often not overcome the hatred for my groupmates that are standing right there with them, and so I can tashani and THEN enthrall.  I almost never get resisted this way.  Even without Tashani I usually succeed with enthrall.  I don't know _exactly_ what my success rate is, but it is high enough that I have not been concerned with resists.  And when I DO get resisted it is usually a simple matter to color shift the mob, then enthrall again.  At higher levels this may get harder to do, but at least on most mobs I have fought recently it works quite well.<P>And when I enthrall without tashaniing first, I will often Tashani afterwards and then re-enthrall.  I don't know if this makes a difference, but that's what I do.<P>When there is a need for crowd control I generally focus only on that (when we pull singletons I tend to nuke and stun a lot), and I will often remez with Enthrall every 20 seconds or so whether the mob twitches or not.  I don't know if this helps, but I will tell you a mob will almost never EVER break my mez this way.  Last night we had a few four and five mob pulls, and I held all but the currently fighting one mob mezzed for the whole battle, the last one having ended up mezzed for like four minutes or so.  Sure, reapplying Enthrall several times uses up mana, but hey, that mana is worth it, and with 192 int plus and extra 100 mana, at lvl 31 I have around 1350 mana, and with Enthrall only costing 50 mana to cast, plus me having constant Clarity, I can Enthrall all day long.  It is worth it for the damage I prevent.<P>So I guess you could say I take the brute force method of crowd control.  I debuff the one stat that I KNOW effects mezzes, ie Magic Resistance, and then I use brute force to keep mezzing the mobs till it is their turn to die.  I don't really care what my charisma is, since at 126 it seems to be high enough, and if I start getting more resists I can easily add more charisma.<P>Mana is king in my opinion.  Once we get the spawn broken up we pull a lot of singletons and sometimes doubles, and then I just toss in one or two Chaos Fluxes and stuns.  For that occasional double or triple pull my charisma seems to be high ENOUGH to keep things under control, and for the singletons I become a nuker and buffer.  And for that you need mana.  Besides, when I hit 34 and start using Radiant Visage (a copy of which I already possess) my cha with the same equipment as I now use, will go up to 135.  In a tough crowd control situation I will swap in my crude stein (I do this sometimes) and my charisma will go up to 150, which is precisely what you show (not scientifically speaking) to be statistically as good as 200 cha.<P>The bottom line is, I have my doubts as to the effectiveness of each point of charisma above a certain level, and I don't think that level is as high as many people think.  However I have perfect faith that each and every point of INT not only gives me more mana, but the effect is the same all the way past 200 int.  Also, up to 200 int some calculations of chance will be increased in my favor, such as my chance of specialization kicking in.<P>Parm Vomgrossenhirn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000809.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=General&TopicSubject=my+tests+on+mez+with+varying+levels+of+cha">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Interesting results.  I, too, think Charisma is highly overrated and has severely diminishing returns as you get closer to 200.<P>Unfortunately, a sample of 50 is way too small.  I forgot the exact formulae, but to get any reasonable confidence interval for a binomial distribution where the hypothesis is around 50% success/failure you need quite a bit more than 50 data points, more like 200 or 300.<P>I'd have to do the calculations to be sure, but based on your findings, one could conclude that CHA does nothing at all -- i.e., one could conclude the difference between 37% and 51% is not statistically significant given the sample size and a reasonable confidence interval (say 95%).<p>[This message has been edited by Tudamorf (edited 02-27-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000809.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=General&TopicSubject=my+tests+on+mez+with+varying+levels+of+cha">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I'm a 22nd level enchantress and I LOVE to enthrall and mesmerize and charm and memory blur. I'm not rich but I have complete a lot of the quest and can buff my charisma into the 190s. I also have NOT seen a big difference between 150 and on. At first, I thought that I should buff my charisma more and more to fix the resist problem (mainly on white/yellow/reds). However, this hasn't done much at all for me and I've run out of mana a few times when I've really needed it. I am willing (*gasp*) to let my charisma drop 20 to 40 point and work on getting the intelligence or mana items to compensate. However, I do also believe that more tests need to be performed. I'd be quite willing to help in any way.<P>Malbena Meanypants<BR>23rd - now 22nd Enchantress<BR>Tarew Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000809.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=General&TopicSubject=my+tests+on+mez+with+varying+levels+of+cha">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Just a couple of comments -<P> 1 - Verant seems to put absolute caps on many rolls (i.e. 5% chance to fail or succeed regardless of skill).<P> 2 - Much like other stats, int has plateaus of usefullness before 200. If you can't reach 200 int, 175 int is nearly as good (however the difference between 165 int and 175 int is huge). I would encourage people to calculate their mana at different setups to make their own choice.<P>3 - The important difference between int and cha is this: Mana is like a battery, you have the energy and you spend it over time. For any particular battle that you are prepared for, an enchanter will most likely have more than enough mana to cast whatever spells are necessary to conquer. The primary usefullness of having a 'bigger battery' is that you are able to smooth out the downtime periods because you have a bigger reserve for crunch time. However, cha is a battle success stat. In other words, if you have 1 chance to charm or mes a light tombstone mob, you want to make sure you have the best chance possible. The number of times I've been beat down because of resists far outnumbers the number of times I've died because of being oom. <P>BTW - Its pretty easy for an enchanter to calculate mana: cancel clarity :-), load up all the mes spells you have (assuming you spec'd alteration) and cast the most expensive one can until you can't even cast lvl 4 mes any more (you can also cast tashan for 10 mana to really empty yourself). Check the scroll back and count casts, etc.<P>Xalren</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000809.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=General&TopicSubject=my+tests+on+mez+with+varying+levels+of+cha">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well I just died tonight, at lvl 31, and lost a whole bubble of exp.  That really sucks.<P>Why did I die?  I will tell you why, because I ran out of mana.  I couldn't gate.  I couldn't mez, or do anything.<P>I was with a group consisting of two bards, a ranger, and a cleric.  We were in the sewers in Cazic.  The puller pulled down a fanatic and a protector.  I called out Mezzing Zealot!  and proceeded to enthrall it.  They were all beating on the protector at the time.  Well they all switched over to the zealot and hit it.  Of course since I had just mezzed it it was angrier at me than it was at them for *****ing it with whatever lame weapons the bards and ranger were using.  So there I took some hits.  I stepped back and enthralled the protector.  Just then two gators showed up and started chomping on me.  I shifted and stood back, someone hit the protector and woke it up.  I enthralled a gator.  I then ran back and casted Mezmerization because the fanatic, protector, and unmezzed gator were ripping serious chunks outta my party members.  I recasted mezmerization a couple more times to make sure it held them all locked down.  Just then another fanatic and protector showed up.  Now we have four lizzies and two gators.  I shifted again, stood back and enthralled both new lizzies.  Meanwhile the incidental hits I am taking before I can get the spells off are slowly wearing me down.<P>The long and short of it is that my groupmates were all using such crappy low damage weapons that they simply could NOT kill those lizzies very fast.  I kept casting mezmerization, shift, and enthrall for what seemed like ages.  At some point early on in the fight I had swapped out my STein of Moggock for my Crude Stein just because I believed I might need that extra charisma boost.<P>My groupmates finally killed MOST of the things in there while I frantically held down all the rest, but I finally ran dry on mana.  And as things started waking up they started tearing into me.  Meanwhile my groupmates, being relatively thin-skinned bards and the ranger, had taken so much damage that the cleric was now OOM, despite one bard playing the clarity song and the cleric having Clarity on from me.<P>I went totally OOM.  I was down to less than half a bubble of health.  And I tried to gate.  I did not have enough mana.  I stood there and took it like a man while my groupmates tried to get the stupid protector, himself almost dead, off of me.  I frantically hit the Gate icon many times, hoping the mana song from the one bard combined with my own Clarity would give me enough mana to gate.  It didn't, and I died.  Then one of the bards died, and the rest of the group ran like hell and zoned with less than two bubbles of health each.<P>With one good Warrior armed with something more than a toothpick we would have won.<P>It just goes to show how I NEEDED that mana at the very end.  I needed finally to just gate.  And I couldn't, because I had succeeded in using up a whole bar of mana, combined with Clarity and a bard singing his Mana song, in one stupid very very long battle.  And the stupid thing was that if I had left in the Stein of Moggock instead of swapping in the Crude STein (my Rod of Insidious Glamor was in my other hand, for increased cha) I would have had the mana to gate.<P>There, got that one off my chest.  As I have said before, MANA IS KING. I remain unconvinced that charisma much over the 130ish range really does much.  I still believe, however, that each point of int I put on gives me around six points of precious mana, and that is important to me.  I still can't recall the last time I died because I was getting too many resists on Enthrall.  But I do remember dying for lack of mana, and tonight it happened again.<P>Oh well, the Crude Stein goes back in the bag for a while again, and out comes the Stein of Moggock.<P>Mana is king!

</FONT><HR>Wow you must have been unlucky dieing there with a bard that had manasong as well. One thing to remember is it can help to memblur the mob before the tanks hit it and to tell them to taunt it a few times first.<P>I tend to agree the problem there is the group and not your mana, controlling that many mobs shouldnt be that hard with fm to start and manasong AND a puller that has any brains. A warrior etc is nice but not essential, i have held that area down with the steel golem with only four of us at lvl 29ish with the main and only tank being a bard in fact i think he was primary healer as well  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif"> .<P>------------------<BR>Fryg Yourmind Lvl 39 Female Erudite Enchanter &lt;Silent Power&gt; (Jewelcraft 187)<BR>Tryg Bravesheart Lvl 37 Female Barbarian Shaman &lt;Silent Power&gt;<BR>Pryg Lvl 15 Female Half Elf Druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000809.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=General&TopicSubject=my+tests+on+mez+with+varying+levels+of+cha">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>No, 50 tests is not enough to prove conclusively the effects that cha has on the mez line, but it's a start.  I did the tests to see if further investigation was necessary.  I believe I have shown that it is.  <P>If I don't level by this weekend I will run the same exact trial again bringing the data set up to around 100 casts for each level of charisma.  If that set of tests matches the outcome of this set of tests I will be pretty sure of my results and start testing at other levels of charisma.  I'd like to test at 85 or 90 (whatever the lowest I can go is, I'm a high elf) and at around 120.  If cha has a big effect on mez as it appears (between 100 and 150) it would be nice to know wear that break occurs.<P>I would also like to run some tests on a red or yellow conning NPC, but I'm not having much luck finding one.  It would be interesting to do some trials on a yellow NPC to find out how much more he resists me at say 200 charisma compared to guard Jendl and if 150 and 200 charisma seem to have any differences for a higher conning NPC.  So I'd like to run 100 trials at 200 and 150 charisma (or lower if I can find an obvious "threshold" point between 100 and 150 cha).  <P>Does anyone know any good guards to try this on who would be yellow to me at 41 or 42?  I'd like to stick to guards under the assumption that they share similar MR levels.  I found a yellow to me guard in North Felwithe that I think I may be able to test on.<P>Thanks for the support, and I encourage anyone to do more testing and post their results.  It would be great to see testing on Color shift/flux and charm, but I think these will be more difficult.  The color line will require that you will take a beating on failures which will make it hard to run a lot of tests (I had to zone a bunch when my first mez didn't stick).  Charm seems to be way more variable in that it can break at a large number of places, also I don't believe guards or non monster NPC's can be charmed so it's going to be hard to find a test subjuect (maybe a PC would work, but I'd prefer to see NPC tests as PVP works differently for some spells).<P>-Maryinn of the Merry Band (Brell Serilis)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000809.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=General&TopicSubject=my+tests+on+mez+with+varying+levels+of+cha">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I am not familiar enough with what songs a bard of that level can sing, so I don't know what they could have done to save me.  I just know that I held down a lot of mobs for a long long time.  I had 192 int and an extra 100 mana from items (I can get my int up over 200 but I have some +mana items I wear instead, like jaded bracers and ring), so I had plenty of mana.  Plus with Clarity on and manasong playing for at least half the battle I would have regenerated a LOT of mana just standing there.  There were too many mobs in there to risk sitting down.<P>In retrospect I really should have used Beguile on one of them before I ran out.  I just thought the others could kill them.  I have not had too much trouble charming those lizzies for several minutes with my high 120s to low 130s charisma (depends on whether I use my Rod of Insidious Glamor and my crude stein), so I should have done it.<P>So the death can be blamed on many things.  Things I could have done.  Things my groupmates could have done.  They broke my mezzes several times, although in the main they were fairly reasonable about it.  They certainly understood the concept and generally used assist, but they did make mistakes sometimes and break my mezzes.  After refreshing Tashani and Enthrall on a gator several times before his mez is broke, he will hate me worse than he hates the guy that just stuck him for 13 dmg, so I got whacked almost every time something woke up, even if it woke up because someone hit him.<P>Oh well, to be honest I really have not had that hard a time mezzing stuff, even when it was beating on me.  I seem to recover concentration and continue casting a LOT on both shift and Enthrall, and their casting time is low enough that I can usually get one off in a mob's face.  I just have to say that unlike so many enchanters who will sacrifice a serious int capacity for insane levels of charisma, I will get my charisma up as high as I think makes much difference and then pour on the int.  Every time I go wishy washy and change that strategy, some particularly long battle comes along and I realize that Mana is truly the king.<P>Oh, one thing, at one point during the night I was using my Incandescent Wand (no charisma) and my Stein of Moggock (likewise no cha) and I had let Sympathetic Aura lapse, so I was really down in charisma.  I suddenly noticed that I was getting resisted left and right.  So I do acknowledge that charisma less than 100 or so hurts you badly on mezzing, and probably on charming, but I just say that they point after which more charisma actually delivers results is a lot lower than many enchanters think.<P>And to Maryinn, thanks for doing those tests.  I like to read these reports, and I am thinking about what I can do to run some of them myself.  Thanks for the good work.  If I can get my good friend Masamune, who is the same level as me (also an enchanter) to agree to spend the time, we can do tests mezzing each other in duel mode and see if we can make heads or tails of it.<P>------------------<BR>Parm Vomgrossenhirn of Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000809.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=General&TopicSubject=my+tests+on+mez+with+varying+levels+of+cha">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>While you do this test, do one additional, time them. <P>It seems to me that all these test are based on the assumption that chr only effects resists.  While it may be true that chr effects resists, I think charisma may strongly effect the time variable of spells that are clearly more time oriented, such as charm and mez.  For spells that are purely a one-time cast of yes its on, or no its not on, then it will only effect resists slightly, such as debuffs.  <BR>   Charisma, to me, seems to more time to my charms and mezes.   I have been further apt to believe this when I see other enchanters saying that charisma does very little, yet they seem to never charm "because its just to short and unreliable".   I, on the otherhand, keep my charisma high and find that my charms last an average of 2 pulls, and thats generally without dropping magic resist.  <BR>  What I submit is that charisma probably more strongly effects the time variable of spells that have a time componant, more than it effects resist rates.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=000809.cgi&ReplyNum=000013&forum=General&TopicSubject=my+tests+on+mez+with+varying+levels+of+cha">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Another point about int that another poster brought up before is that it only matters if you med to full before every battle.<P>To the poster who blames lack of mana on his death, did you start the battle with full mana?  If you didn't, then your intelligence did not matter.<P>I rarely if ever med to full.  Thus I am only using a fraction of my intelligence making higher intelligence worthless.  You regain the same amount of mana through mediation regardless of whether your int is 200 or 100.

</FONT><HR>Ok let's not be silly (to the person right above me)...<P>You don't gain a percentage of your BUBBLE each tick... you gain a SET AMOUNT OF MANA per tick.  Meaning if I have ZERO mana and 150 INT and med for 2 minutes I have the SAME amount of mana (although different amount of filled bubbles) as the 200 INT and ZERO mana enchanter who med's during that same two minutes.  It looks different but we can cast the same amount of spells because we both have, say, 500 mana!  It doesn't matter.  Once you get to a higher level (40+) you shouldn't EVER reach FM... if you do you are NOT contributing to your party enough.  <P>My conclusion and the conclusion of most intelligent players (who think about it instead of just basing it off the MORE MANA = more spells lie) is that your amount of mana doesn't effect you as much as everyone seems to think.  I have a CHA of 271 now with my buffs.  I tell you 150 - 200 CHA is negligable.  All your tests only test 100 - 150 - 200 CHA... test it with 250 + and you will see the same thing I do... CHARISMA rules!<P>I NEVER have to cast Tashania on anything, even in the planes.  Scarelings (renown for their high MR) fall without a Tashania.  I am NOT saying that those who think INT is more important than CHA are stupid, but rather maybe haven't seen the big picture cause they see 150 - 200 CHA doesn't make much difference... I see the point of 221 making a BIG difference... and my 271 RULES!  I go CHA, AC, HP, INT in my order of NEEDS... and I don't die with a decent group. (CHARISMA doesn't help against those Clerics in Hate though, hehe).  I can't buff up 4 parties any faster with 200 INT than I can with 163 (my INT)... because I am regaining mana at the same amount per tick as if I had 200 INT.  My advice to all the "newbies" is to do your OWN tests.  Don't worry about what anyone says.  If CHA helps you more than INT, great, you are starting to understand the game in YOUR point of view.  If INT gives you more mana and you feel that is important because it effects you 1% of the time (when you get to med to full) than GREAT  <IMG SRC="http://eq.castersrealm.com/forums/smile.gif">  again your point of view.<P>Ok... this is turning into a rant and I am starting to dribble off now, but I never run out of mana DURING a battle...
