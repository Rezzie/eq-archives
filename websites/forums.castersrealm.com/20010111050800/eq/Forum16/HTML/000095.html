</FONT><HR>I had actually a pretty good day... well most of it... I was on the mainland in the arena from some previous a@@ beating so I headed toward kunark.  <P>Got to oasis and this newbie was training mobs around so I DD'd one and then mezzed the other one and he is like "What are you doing???" and im like "Train stopping, enchanters do that" so he says "YOU stole my exp!" and im like "it looked more like you were going to die rather than get exp for it" and he said the mob was his pet so im like "if it was youre pet then my DD wouldnt have killed it, i know ive tried casting on other peoples pets before" so he said "well uhhh maybe it might have broke charm" and im like "so I did stop a train?" and he says some more BS then something like "Well since you took my EXP can i get a clarify?" so im like "sure at the dock hurry" and he comes back at like 20% hp.  There is a dbane also at the dock and I get off the dock making sure to keep my eye on the dbane and clarify him at like 10% hp and he is still training.  He says somethin like "SURE IT HELPS NOW" when he is running off and im like "did i do something wrong here?"<P>I sat there and thought about it and i was kinda wondering why a newbie would be pissed off if I saved him from one train and clarified him on demand with the threat of conflict causing me to lose my boat ride.  I dont think I did but the newbie was pretty pissed off oh well he can duel me in 30 lvls and get his a** beat like all the rest.  <P>After that I got off the boat in timorous and went to my favorite place the combine chamber.  I was chillin runnin around in circles and DDing myself and stuff like that inside the combine chamber that nobody ever seems to be able to tell me which light source to hit.  Anyway I accidentally fell into the burning sticks one when i was running around in circles weavnig in and out of the pots when I was testing my coordination and such after a while and went back go grobb.  Once I got there i was like hey i only got 3 food/water i might as well get some more and i found a 45 shaman in there.  I showed him my bomb medicine totem and he about dies when I told him I wouldnt have killed the mob or even seen it if it didnt aggro on me on its own.  Anyway I ask him to duel like i do to everyone i see and he accepts and says "ware yuz wunt tu du dis?" and i say les try fearoot.<P>We get there and fully buff and get pets etc and when we both get back to FM he DOT himself (BTW he had INSANE MR) and im like ok wait till i get ready and i hit /d and targetted his pet and started backing up.  He didnt wait till i was ready and just hit /d and started casting  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> my fault i forgot to say that we would fight when i said go.... anyway he sends his pet in against mine and tries malaisement on me and runs in and starts wasting my pet.  Anyway at this point him and his pet are both beating on mine and taking it down pretty fast.  My pet is attacking his so when my pet is near death i DD his instantly killing it from 60% hp.  The shaman then finishes off my pet with a few pokes and by this time I had sieved twice and pillaged the shaman twice as well as tishania him.  He cures his poison and comes charging at me.  I basically do the crazy kite and run around in random directions stopping to cast mez every once in a while and he is trying to root me but neither one of our spells is sticking.  I finally get a mez off on him and get a new pet and then sieve him a bit more.  He is pretty low on mana so I figure the best way to win would be to get my new pet on him as fast as possible before he gets any sort of mana or another pet or something.  I cast fire shield on the shaman and run up to hit him but i forgot i banked my incandescent wand.  Im like DANG IT NOW WHAT DO I DO.  I sit down to med and the shaman does the same thing.  He gets a bit of mana and tries to root the pet and does then comes up and starts hitting me with his spear for a bit.  He also uses cannabalize to get some mana with and I sieve him after every time he uses it.  He like runs off into the middle of the zone with SOC and I tail him the best I can and finally find him after a bit.  I sieve him getting rid of all the mana he had medded and my pet broke root so it was OTW.  I sat down and memmed resist magic and when it caught up and started hitting the shaman I casted MR on it and he kited it around for a while with me keeping him in TOW.  Eventually I wore him down with pillages on his sow's and sieves on his mana from cannabalize and everything and the pet finished him off when he couldnt cannabalize any more for fear of exp death.<P>He said he wanted to know if higher CHA would make him able to stick malaise more on me and I said I didnt think so and he insisted that he try anyway.  He ran and got his cha stuff and just sat there chain casting malaise on me to see if it would work and i guess it worked not because of higher cha but because he tried it like 15 times.  Anyway after that wore off he said he wanted to duel again.  <P>I had to relog in that time because pet kills cause duel bugs so I did that and got a new pet and made him agree to "no running all over the zone"  The second fight was less eventful with me enthralling his pet OTW in and his root again didnt stick and I had an easy time kiting around while my pet was hitting him in his back and he was trying to melee me.  He got to like 80% and stopped to deal with the pet and I sieved and pillaged him while he was rooting it.  He finally got it rooted and came after me again so I kited him around and kept mezzing his pet.  Eventually he stopped and I got off a few more sieves and pillages and the pet killed him.  He said it was because a lag spike hit and his computer thought my pet ran off into the woods and wouldnt let him root it.  Sucks and I hate when that happens to me in duels but it was another pet kill so nobody congratulated me on this not so meaningful victory.<P>After this I got a tell from a lvl 48 Cleric who bought my totem for 9k.<P>I duelled a thief that was my friend between the shaman duels, which I lost but it wasnt about losing the duel this time. We had fight about us treating each other unfairly.  She was a thief and had insane MR and i had fireform+feedback+rune and her HP dropped faster than she could see it go down.  She said she wont fight me because it wasnt fair, so I stopped attacking her.  We argued for a while and I removed my dmg shields and she got rid of her MR down to 89.  I used tashania on her and I casted about 15 spells on her which were all resisted and told her to stop fighting because it was easy to see the fight was definately unfair, she didnt stop and killed me, I was very sad because of her talking about fairness like that and then shredding me very unfairly.  I told her that I didnt like what she had done after speaking about fairness and we almost broke the friendship over it, but after I got her to admit that it was unfair and she was sorry for doing that, she kissed me and we made up and we are happy again.<P>Oh yeah and somewhere in the arguing with her I had to do a real enchanter thing on her IRL and play some mind games with her to get her to actually go from anger and frustration to regretfulness and comprimising or whatever.  She was very stubborn about it too she told me after it that she HATES admitting she is wrong and REALLY HATES apoligizing, but did so because I was worth staying friends with.<P>I guess that last one is kinda like losing the battle but winning the war, huh?<P>Tsunamii Val'Sharess<BR>Tha Wreckin Ball</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=16&topic=000095.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=PvP&TopicSubject=Yesterday....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>A whole pumice wont get rid of clarify, fireform, feedback, or rune.  Not to mention the fact that JBoots is first or second on my list and I can refresh that the split second its gone every time so they are only pumicing one buff.  It would take them upwards of 3 whole pumices to start hitting the good stuff.<P>Also if they were to attempt to use 3 full pumice on me that would take about 3.5 seconds times 15 charges so somewhere around 60 seconds.  Pumice can also be interrupted with chaotic feedback since it has such a long cast time.  60+ seconds is a long time to wait before a thief begins actual physical attack and that is more than enough time to land a mez or something.  Unless you are talking about the old pumice which 2 of those would get rid of all the buffs i had no matter what but who wants to waste 2 whole OLD pumice to keep themselves from losing a duel?  Most I know would save it to keep themselves from getting PKed.<P>To answer your question, yes a lot of people (rogues and non rogues) pumice (mostly crystallized) me which either gets chaotic feedback to interrupt it or it takes off my jboots and one buff (usually shade or augmentation or see invis) and then jboots is right back on.  <P>To answer the deeper underlying question, no it has no effect on me at all.<P>Tsunamii Val'Sharess</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=16&topic=000095.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=PvP&TopicSubject=Yesterday....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Okay, here was my *real* point:<BR>Let's say you're fighting this rogue, in sol b. He has insane MR (100+ after tashan, pretty easy to get with the right cheap gear). He starts pumicing your buffs off (crystallized)...what're you going to do? Sit there and rebuff? Waste your mana on resisted nukes? Either one costs you more time and mana than it costs him. Chaotic Feedback is going to do nothing, since its long recast time prohibits chain casting. Rogue pumices your buffs off and starts unloading on you...what now?<P>FYI, I don't know about you, but my level 28 warrior on Rallos carries around two backpacks full of pumice. I don't use em often, but when I need them, I need a LOT of em. <P>Now, I do concede, with a pet the scenario is decidedly in your favor...but in reality no rogue will attack you with you having a pet up.<P>------------------<BR>Branar Shmanar<BR>*Forged Souls*<BR>55 enchanter<BR>The Seventh Hammer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=16&topic=000095.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=PvP&TopicSubject=Yesterday....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>In sol b vs an insane MR rogue I wouldnt fight without a pet.... actually there isnt much I would want to fight that has INSANE mr that I cant get any damage off on.  Gotta have a pet so I can hit the guy at least... even if a thief could solo it in not all that many seconds.  There is just something that enchanters need when the opponent has huge MR and thats called a pet.  A duel isnt a duel if you cant do damage and they can...<P>At that point its considered a slaughter.<P>Tsunamii Starshine<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=16&topic=000095.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=PvP&TopicSubject=Yesterday....">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum16&number=16&thisthread=000095&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum16&number=16&thisthread=000095&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
