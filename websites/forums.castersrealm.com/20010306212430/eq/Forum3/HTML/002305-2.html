</FONT><HR>As I read through this discussion, I am stunned by the effectiveness of Absor's spin, and how little attention is truly being paid to the crux of this little situation.<P>To refer to this change as "dynamic content" is ludicrous.  If you logged in one day to find North Qeynos destroyed by and overrun with Blackburrow Gnolls, then you would be able to classify THAT as dynamic content.  EQ, as programmed, is unable to make such changes.  Therefore, EQ is unable to provide dynamic content.  Norrath was designed to be, and shall always be, a static world.<P>Referring to the change as an upgrade to mob AI is probably a bit closer to the mark.  And some of Absor's later comments even hint that this was the reason for the change.  And from a logical standpoint, I can even accept this point of view with some dispair.<P>But... this is NOT the FIRST reason that was given for the change.<P>Quoting the February 21 patch message: "We've redressed the amount of hate generated by heal spells. Previously, and *partly* due to a bug, the high level heal spells such as superior heal or complete heal would generate no more hate than greater heal."<P>The REAL, CONCRETE reason why this change was made was a BUG FIX.<P>EQ has been live for almost two years.  If you count the beta cycles, it's been around for even longer.  After all this time, after two years of live service, incorporating tens of millions of manhours of "release playtesting", they choose to fix this bug now?<P>Thy only question I'm left with is "Why"?  When you add up the staggering amount of time that this game has been played, why make such a fundamental change now?<P>The only answer I can even remotely think of is "because they can".<P>To wit, my reply is simple: Just because you CAN do a thing doesn't necessarily mean that you SHOULD do a thing.<P>Absor has done a good job as Community Relations Manager, and as such, has soothed many wounds that were inflicted by his predecessor.<P>But changes like this show that the EQ Live team is STILL, after all this time and after stepping into so many quagmires, STILL infinitely more focused on the game than the people playing the game.  I feel pretty safe in saying that no one ASKED for this change.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000026&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well I'm a lvl 59 cleric in a very active guild on my server.  <P>I'm just shocked to see that VI is pleased with these changes and they "think" that its for the good of the game and will make the game more "challenging" and therefore "fun."<P>First, maybe I was dreaming....but didn't VI agree 100% that clerics were boring to play?  I mean we sit, we buff, we heal and we rez' the dead and repeat.  The only real satifaction we get is timing off a good heal to prevent someone from dying.   <P>Was this change suppose to resolve this problem?   Because from every high level and well respected cleric I know, we are all pissed off about this change.   VI has taken away our comfort level of doing our boring job.   And I guess they are telling us to hey guys, look for new tactics, and have fun.  Thanks for pulling the blanket on this untested change on us.   No wonder we're so unhappy, good customer satifaction!<P>Well last night our guild did a raid and this new aggro change had turn what should have been a fun and challenging raid into a long and painful experience.   Clerics tried different tactics.  Some of us used celetrial heals, which only lead to some people dying to mobs dishing out way too much damage.   Others perfectly timed off a CH to a fully buffed tank, only to instantly die before they could get off DA.   Others tried Remedy, and DL, only to face getting hammered.   We had tons of tanks split on multiple mob pulls, doing all they could to taunt them and yet healer after healer would drop and die.   <P>The mobs we were handling could not be mezzed or rooted, and in many cases couldn't be singled pulled.   So what is the answer Verant?   Are we suppose to mem an Atone line of spells?   We are lucky just to get DA off, what makes you think we can cast atone, click on uber-useless donal bracer or the like?!?<P>Verant screwed this one up majorly and will only end up adding more patched to rebalance the mess they constantly keep changing.<P>So what was VI's bottom line on this change?  To add more challenge to the game?  But they themselves know they haven't fully tested this out and they agree that on some higher end mobs, it was a mistake.   So know they have to go back and patch a patch.   What a shame?   What was so broken that it required VI to start this mess?<P>So many high level clerics are pissed off.  Guild raids take longer, there is more downtime and everyone is just upset.  Yet, we are suppose to give it more time and try to find new tactics.  <P>Remove the damn aggro patch!   The game was just as fun and challenging on high end raids before, we dont need you guys to say what we find challeging!   You cannot perfect a game like EQ, all you're doing it trying to patch things, only to end up patching your old patches.   EQ will not be perfect, and it's only a dream for you guys to think it can.<P>If you want to fix anything, fix the entire AI system so that mobs know how to attack better in general.  Its just a cheap shot to use your poor AI system to just b-line them to kill a cleric to make the game harder!<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000027&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Yea what was wrong with the game anyhow? I thought the taunt factor was fine and you all had to go and screw it up... It's not like a cleric never dies because he heals.. And yes I've played since the patch and i think it's crap!! TOTAL CRAP! example: I was in CT with a 34 ogre warrior I'm a 33 dwarf cleric btw... anyways I GH'd him 2 times.. ok the lizard sentinel did NOT taunt off of me until he was 75% dead from the warrior he was taunting the WHOLE time! however I did not take very much damage only due to the fact that he was missing and I was dodging. But even said 75% damage on him and my aggro was still higher? I think this needs to either be re worked or revamped or taken away... I btw did not do any damage melee or non-melee during the fight, I think that this is ridiculous how much the taunt factor is increased.  and last but not least I know this isn't the place for this but I'm hoping you'll see it here...  How do you justify fixing druids more than you already have when so many of our cleric spells are worthless and broken due to the evolving of the Dynamic world such as the lull line resisted far too much summon hammers suck and and our pet is worthless... Druids are THE most played character in the game err at least on Cazic Thule server they are... They can do it all they don't need more.. how about a self invis as was asked about earlier in our talks? what ever happened to that? We are the only class that can cast without invis.. not even self invis.. perhaps defense skills raised perhaps adding bash so clerics might be able to fend for themselves against the greenies..  something... anything.............

</FONT><HR>Well I have a 52 soon to be 53 Warrior.  My wife has a 52 Cleric.  Pre patch the hole was pretty tough...post patch...if she heals while we are fighting a Rock Golem then she gets agroed instantly...I agree with change and I think it is good; however, there has to be a happy medium to their changes. Personaly I think their class balancing and they way they did it was a farse and the classes are no longer balanced.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000029&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>i have been to a few raids since the patch and i havent noticed a big difference <BR>maybe because i dont use instant heals much and working more with celest elixir which has highly smaller aggro than ch or other but i would like to mention one thought the point is not that clerics have it harder now to keep the mobs off them the point is verant has never cared about clerics and now they gave them another disadvatage that is the point that makes us all upset <BR>i believe that because clerics are so much needed for every high lvl action verant hates them and refuses to give them good spells or abbillities i mean look at the post 50 spells how many useful ones are there hardly 5 and that in 10 hell lvl gosh not only they continue absolute useless spell lines ever good spell has been nerfed to profanity (mark of karn and our uber pet just to name some) <BR>they made the life of a cleric very very boring =&gt; sit on your ass and med heal and res from time to time very interesting and in addition a lvl 52 clr with the pog bp and epic is no difference to a lvl 60 one ( oh ye a few points more mana what a difference) no wonder so many clerics start twinks and retire except for guild events or quit the game entirely </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000031&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Someone already said it (sorry too lazy to go back and find it now)<P>VI wanted to slow you down.  <P>What tactics are they (anyone) talking about?  Experience, taught me how to become as efficient with my heals as possible.  I get the most out of each heal so that my mana lasts and the group can keep pulling at a nice pace.<P>So now, I have to heal sooner with smaller heals which makes me less mana efficient.  That also means that the rest of my group has to adjust/learn new tactics.<P>This crap about clerics relearning their job is just that... CRAP!  All the other players have to retune, try harder not to pull mults(whether you have a high enchanter or not), be prepared to res the clerics when anything hard has been pulled... whatever *sigh*<P>Learn to be less mana efficient and slow down, that's what they're asking for...<P>Oh well, good luck fellow clerics, I just bring mine out for big raids now.  I've tried the post patch play and it sucks.  It was boring before, and now it just sucks.  <P>I'll continue to bop around with my twinks so that I can talk to friends online and I'll go with friends to regain lost exp after raids.  I'll continue to warn RL friends away from the game *shrugs* and I'll wait for friends to transition to the next game.  This was my first on-line game even though I'm an old man.  Thanks for the good times, wish they were back.<P>------------------<BR>Lunadar Darkfyre<BR>Battle worn Vicar of <I><B>The Renegades</I></B><BR>& Proud husband of the angel Zeria<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Lunadar (edited February 24, 2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000032&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>An evolving environment they say? Well I remember back when you can fight the uber-mobs with a variety of classes. There was strategy back then. You timed your Ice Comets against Nagafen, you mana-sucked Vox, you Fear-kited Cazic-Thule.<P>Then, bit by bit, the environment EVOLVED to fit the vision, until there is only one way to do things, tons of pure melee and tons of clerics. All the other classes are disabled bit by bit until they are completely useless, yet people kept their mouths shut.<P>The players adapted: They quit their necros, they quit their shamans, they quit their druids, they quit their bards, and they twinked the only classes which are worth a damn, they adapted by abandoning their characters and twinked melees and clerics.<P>I have said it time and time again: WE ALL HAD IT COMING, kid. Nobody is above Verant's screwing. They disabled the Feign Death pull; they disabled Mesmerize; they disabled all non-wizard damage; they disabled non-melee damage; their only way to challenge you in uber-encounters is to COMPLETELY DISABLE THINGS.<P>What made you think healing would be an exception?<P>Just you watch, next to come: melee damage will be disabled.<P>I mean, I enjoy a good challenge as much as the next guy, but sh*******t.<P>This is not a challenge, this is boredom and lack of imagination personified.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000036&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR> Hello<BR>I am a 57 cleric on Morrel Thule. I dislike the new increase in agro for clerics. Don't misunderstand me, I can see how it would make for a more challenging game experince and that it was needed maybe to help balance out somethings but........I heal so much that it is becoming a continues rez feast 2001. I have only spent 3 days with these changes and the experince is less than desirable. I wont threaten to stop playing, cause we all know that wont happen but I hope that you can nerf the nerf. Wich means lower the agro rate. I am a cleric...I sit I heal, sit and heal, sit and heal. That is boring to say the least but to add a frustrating agro that is so high to the mix makes my game play suck. Well this will go unread wich maybe it should.

</FONT><HR>IF you want to create an evolving game, may be you can stick to certain areas of the map, ie, healing nerf applies to Velious only.   Basically you are looking for changes to make the game more interesting. <BR>Constant changes in some mobs' abilities, like from fire to cold attacks, etc and even more in certain dungeons.  Have more GM-controlled mobs - ppls love those.  Small changes can make a big difference in strategy, as you must know.  Try out the changes in some areas first if you must. So that some ppls can try things out.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000038&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I'm a rogue... I have one thing to say about that.  What rogue is pleased about evade?  <P>I can easily adjust my damage output so that I don't taunt to much with the new evade but the ONLY thing I'm pleased about is that verant didn't screw it up and then have 5 emergency patchs to fix it.<P>Now, what they did do was make too many changes to the hate lists at once.  Rogues are at the top more, if a warrior hits defensive there dmg output is so low that they aren't tanking anymore, casters all have higher aggro.  I'm not saying I can't deal with the changes... you just have to be a lot more careful with aggro now.  I'm also only talking about the high level game... 51+ and mostly boss mob type npcs.  At lower levels a Warrior can taunt with a 2h weapon.  51+ warriors are forced into using 1h's in order to taunt.  In other words aggro at lower levels is so much easier to control that the lower level players that are complaing or praising really have little say.<P>I guess all I'm saying is please don't say some rogues are pleased with the evade changes.  They're accepted and that's about all.<P>Borader 55 Blackgaurd<BR>Prexus<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000041&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>This is the first time I've ever posted a reply. I'm a 24 cleric so don't have a lot of experience in playing EQ but what I wanna say isn't so much about the game but about the quality of these discussions.<P>Has anyone actually gone back and checked out how aggressive and non-productive the discussions are? Let me rephrase that because they're not discussions, they're arguments.<P>Verant are saying, "yes we want your feedback and appreciate it" then back it up with a seemingly arrogant stand on changes. Hmmm, maybe you're wrong Verant and maybe there is value in what your clients say.<P>And you clerics out there. If you're gonna have a whinge then do it when you've calmed down. Think about what you're gonna say and suggest something constructive.<P>The last few postings and replies I've read actually didn't tell me anything about the changes and what the problems were.<P>Cheers - Dannen the Cleric... </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000042&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Dear Verant Team, <P>   I am so tired of hearing you spout out the work "Broken".  It actually infuriates me when I hear you say this word, for I feel that you generalize everything you don't like about Everquest under this word.  If an NPC is suppose to something, and he doesn't - then he is "Broken."  If an Warrior Discipline is suppose to double the damage output, and doesnt - then it is "Broken."  <P>   If a cleric's "heal" spell makes the bad guys hate the cleric more than the guy poking him with the sword, and this is the way people have learned to kill things in their tactics since day ONE, then this is not "broken", it has become "out-of-balance."  Whether this is "out-of-balance" or not, I can not say.  I can say that your use of the word "broken" is "out-of-balance."<P>  Things like Donal's Breastplate, which were implemented that way for a reason, were not considered as you put, "broken", until players found a way to abuse them.  And players will try to find a way to abuse everything.  Actually, that makes for a VERY fun game, trying to figure out all little ways to abuse things.  So long as the implementer's find out the little things and fix them, and create more little things to abuse.  Which was done with Donal's and I believe was warranted and very well thought out.  Good Job Verant!  <P>   But what you didn't do a good job with is Clerics.  They were not "broken", but they may have been "out-of-balance."  To change the way an entire class works for the worst is not fair to anyone.  Yeah, when Vox completely heals herself that does piss off a lot of people.  But you didn't nerf Vox.  Instead of Nerfing clerics.. why don't you hurt clerics by putting 4 enchanter mobs in the room that targets cleric and Mana-seiv them.  That would be a cooler way to deal with the problem than to Nerf clerics ability to Heal innately.  <P>  If anything, please stop saying things are "broken."  If they were broken, they would cause the game to crash or make you get stuck in the wall or something.  Stop using the word broken when something doesn't work the way you think it should.  If a cleric found a way to completely heal a tank 40 times in 2 seconds for no mana, that would be "broken."  <P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000043&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>As a high level wizard and shaman this new AI NERF, and yes it is the hardest nerf that has even been done in EQ flat out sucks. I have researched this in my own groups and watched other mid level groups and spoke to them in full detail and watch their encounters.  Even as my shaman I can now chain cast slow and malo with little regard for the aggro that 1 decent heal causes.<P>My wizard chain casting the best nuke landing 100% of the time doesnt even compare to the aggro that this one heal causes.<P>The main issues are that it was nerfed too hard without any chance to offset it.  You drilled the clerics-warriors-and rogues all in one patch.<P>I somewhat agree that healing should cause aggro but this much is hardly making this game fun anymore.  there must be a balance to the warriors or other heavy tanks that allow them to get these mobs off the clerics or shaman before they get pummeled to death.<P>in airplane 1 CH = instadeath<BR>in Growth 1 CH = insta death<BR>in any higher level zone it is the same.<P>a cleric that is away form the fight casting CH on a person not even engaged with the mob or has done 1 pt of damage to this mob causes the mob or any mobs near him to run straight to him and beat him to death<P>now most say find new tactics....hmmm friggin HOW?<P>enchanters cant mezz these things mostly, they cant be rooted, cant be stunned (hell they cast gate straight thru with 30 tanks beating the hell out of them and everyone and their mothers trying to nuke and stun them) how can you justify these types of encounters?<P>IMHO you got upset because the upper 3% of your player base outsmarted your dragons and such and you have now taken your ball and gone home.<P>in closing the general feeling on our server is that not a single person on staff at VI has played this game at this level to experience these matters first hand.  You call and ask Furor his opinions, you go watch triton or FoH kill stuff.  Have you played your character from level 1 with a friggin stick and 1 copper to 60 with the best gear you can get from RoK and parts of SoV, or did you jsut use the magic GM wand and make yourself 60 with uber crap and go along on a raid here and there and watch what everyone else was doing?<P>There is a HUGE difference in the experience of the person that plays their character to 60 than one that gets it handed to them and goes along for the ride.  Ask your upper player base to get into a chat room and get their feelings on how much they appreciated finding out into a deep dungeon crawl or into a raid that a pivitol player was EBAYED and has no friggin clue how to play effectively. Same thing here im afraid.<P>Sincerely,<P>Disgruntled Paying Customer</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000044&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>As far as this question goes there can be a lot of answers.  I think that when I read "a changing and evolving world"  I think of a world that actually changes.  By this I mean that Qeynos is over-run by corrupt guards, cabilis is rebuild, empires fall and rise...ect.  <P>What verrant interpitation seems to be a world where the characters change.  They get smarter, stronger, and so forth.  To me this kind of change offers challenge, but is not nessisarly as fun.  <P>I would love to go to qeynos after beeing away for months to find that it is run by the plague bringers.  Or go to Kunark and find the iksar have rebuild some more of there lost empire.  This to me would be fun and offer adventure to the game.  The changes they make, though they offer a challenge, may seem fun to some.  But to most they seem frustrating.<P>One thing that VI has a problem of doing, not that i am all that frustrated with them, is they seem to change the game into a game THEY would love to play, more than ther CUSTOMER would.  I think when VI does those polls when you log in, is a great thing.  It give them and idea of what there customer whants, and that is more important than what they want.<P>My opinion on the Healing agro, is that it has been broken so long that they should of left it that way.  The game has been out for two years+ and most of the player have been playing all of that time.  Now that they are comfortable with the game, VI goes and makes a big change that really would of went over better in the begining of the games life, not the maturaty of it.  I think that they should do a better job prioritizing there bug fixing.  I have seen some things that go into a patch that to me are not as worthy as attention as the Healing agro for instance.  I know what i think is more important is differnt from many ppl, but big changes should be done first.  Unless the little change affects the game in a big way.<P>Just my 2cp on this issue.<BR>Thanks for reading<BR>Senidyen</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=002305.cgi&ReplyNum=000045&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Changing+the+Rules|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Okay, here's the thing, I don't see why everyone always complains so much when Verant's just trying to make EQ more interesting.  I play a cleric, yes, when I played the first time after the patch it was different, more difficult, so?  I'll be the first to admit that in an undead zone, clerics can at times out damage wizards, personally I think clerics are a little over powered to begin with.  So why is everyone complaining that Verant made it more realistic?  Really, think about it, what's the first mobs you attack when you have a group?  The HEALER, then who?  The BLASTER/WIZARD-TYPE.  Why?  Because they're the two biggest threats.  Why should mobs act any different, if anything I think that healers should just automatically be a little higher on the list of aggro to mobs that hate them.

</FONT><HR>Im sick of hearing all of you players ***** and ***** and *****! Everquest is and always will be a challenge, as said above when you find ways to handle every situation there should be change! I play a wizard, ill admit i  have *****ed before but i live with my class regardless of the power it has, it represents me at a player and a person. If you want comfortable then ***** and have VI make everythign lvl 1 so all of you can finally have your peace. ***** and have them make it easy for you! All I know is that if my class has the hardest epic or the toughest time getting from level to level so be it. It only makes it more important to me when i achive that fabled 60. All i know is that if i spend hours and hours camping something and someone KS's me I will be mad yes, but it will make the time when i do get my sought after item so great that i gladly applaud VI and its ideas its vision and the way of life it has formed, deal with change, deal with challenge, or don't deal with anything!<P>Caolite of the tribunal<P>p.s.
