</FONT><HR>It is very very necessary to be in a large guild to obtain the uber loot in this game.  All dragon raids are guild exclusive, efreeti lord, planes, and kunark dungeons are primarly guild only as well.  The only possible way for a non-uber guild member to get in a dragon raid or plane break is to have a real life friend that has pull in an uber guild to invite you.  It is just not possible for smaller guilds or non-guild players to attempt the kinds of feats.  Verant says that "Most people should have formed relationships by reaching those levels that provide the much needed support."  But how many of you have 45 high level friends that you could join together to take down Venril Sathir?  As for now, all of us non-uber guild members will have to save all our pp from selling FS weapons and someday hope to find an uber guild member retiring so we can pay way too much for a piece of dragon loot.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001566.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+need+for+friends|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I am the leader of a large guild on Torvonnilous. I can and do take non guilded people with us on events. The primary factor is if I know you, or sombody else in the guild knows you well enough to put your name to me. I choose classes that can fill out gaps before others.<P>Druids, Necros, Magicians, they tend to be the ones left out. Not enough time spent grouping, never made the connections. Warriors, Clerics, other dependant classes, they tend to be the ones who know enough of the right people.<P>I do take note of druids and necros that I see looking for groups, because these are usualy the sort of team players I would like on our raids. Last thing anybody wants is a druid who only knows snareing and starfire, or a necro who never did anything but fearkite.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001566.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+need+for+friends|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Yes, this is one of the things I really don't like about this game.  I have a level 54 nercro who has soloed a lot.  I also understand how to be a good group member. I do feel that the above statement about necros is somewhat off base due to the fact that necros do not just fearkite.  We have our little warrior friends and it's my job to keep him alive.  There are many places I can solo where fear is not an option, where my little friend has to go toe to toe with the mob and I must pact, take hits, and so on.  There are a few things I often forget due to the fact that I don't go on raids where the cleric ends up OOM or whatever because it's a tough fight.  With a little info before the raid I can and will fill the roles a necro is needed for.  <BR>Since I'm guildless and will remain that way, I've resigned to the fact that I will never loot a Mystic Eye Patch or that lovely white dragon scale.  I have been invited on a few raids but have turned them down because I was told I am not allowed a chance at the loot.  This is probably what has kept me out of a guild all together.  I will never feel it fair that because you are in an uber guild and feeling friendly and filling some gaps with my necro( I do have a rep as a good necro), that I can kill but not loot.  These rare times when I'm invited will be my only chance to loot some of this nice stuff, why not give it up if I win the roll, or the raid leader doles it out.  Otherwise I'm just helping uber guild mage get his nice robe.  No way.  I just can't do this.  <BR>So hey if your guild goes on raids invite some of us unguilded people, many of us are good fighters and can really use the chance. <BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001566.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+need+for+friends|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I must Disagree as well. I am a 55 dwarven cleric on prexus and am in a small guild of friends. I am the highest in my guild by a long shot, but that doesnt me I lack uber loot or invites to raids. I have been to the planes many times, and was part of the group the killed Trakanon for the first time on my server. I was the first person to have Donal's gloves on the server even though when I got them, I was with a BIG guild, and there were other clerics there. I will say you must prove yourself and make friends. If I had soloed to 55, then I wouldnt have made friends and wouldnt have been invited on the raids. Some things in the game, like RL, require more than 1 person. Also alot of people who just solo, are not as good as people who group, and therefor wont be invited on raids, so I suggest you group more and make a few friends.<P>Dolganar</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001566.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+need+for+friends|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I don't necessarily disagree with the Guild thing at high levels ... I just think that to avoid manipulation of a spawn, or a zone, that there should be an "invisible number" that will not allow more than a certain percentage of players from one Guild into the place, or something similar like it.<P>This, of course, is going to bring about massive cheating. Dismember from the Guild and get back on right after.<P>Basically, I feel that any kind of manipulation in these areas should be out right outlawed and a severe warning should be issued. A log of all events, and the players' names should be noted. And then complaints addressed ... <P>If, we remove the main people in these high areas, all the Uber players, it will help in a few ways ... farming, and a chance to get the loot. As it is right now, too much of the level 60 drops are reserved for about 10 players on each server, and no one else will be able to get it unless these players are taken out, or there is a seriouos threat to the farming content being done by higher level players, who feed their twinks and secondaries, in order for them not to need "other players" in a zone to reach a specified goal.<P>What is the answer? That's for Verant to decided. They have turned this game into a power levelling thing, and much of this game is controlled by several players and their Guild ... it is going to take another full year before another Guild can safely get established enough to go take down Trek, after Fires of Heaven ... <P>While FoH, to my knowledge, has not manipulated various places and spaces, it did have a massive problem with another Guild that eventually moved to another server. And I feel that is unjustified and unfair, and should have been addressed sooner or later, and these things would not have happened.<P>Verant has mentioned that they prefer that everyone agree with themselves and so on, and this is fine and romantic, but not the reality when it comes to greed. They could easily address this with a calender on their homepage for scheduled events for each server ... so that three Guilds show up to do Trek, and it is way too many people and instead there is a massive fight at the door way.<P>I say ... does Verant want to address this issue? With the numbers of high level players rising, they will have more problems with it in the future ... are they ready to handle it? Do they want to handle it?<P>We'll find out after the big bang, right? Or after the first massive argument that gets 3 people banned!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001566.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+need+for+friends|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

I consider myself a skilled necromancer and I know how to fight with or without a pet and in every situation you can drop a necro into.  I do agree that its frustrating to not be able to get into higher level raids and the few times I have I rarely get a shot at anything.  I made the mistake of creating my own guild and keeping it small, well managed and mostly friends.  When we failed to gather enough people to do higher level dungeons on our own, we had to look for other options.  Most large successful guilds don't like outsiders.  Keep in mind for every level 50+ person in a guild, he's got one or two friends outside the guild he'd like to have join the raid.  In addition, they all have their twinks.  At the end of the day, your chances of getting in a group like this are slim and your chance of looting something, astronomically slim.<p>[This message has been edited by deepshadow (edited 08-15-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001566.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+need+for+friends|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

I have a bard main character and can still help them out. <P>They have already told me that I am welcome to join up with them as I raise in levels, and I have met some of their friends...some of whom I also played with when we started out at the same time, before they went way above me.<P>I do not hear them complain about the guild issue - and they are not in huge guilds (some are guildless). They still manage to get nice stuff though :-)<P>So - depending on the character you play, how you play it, and whether you keep in touch with in game friends, you can still be successful without being in an uberguild.<P>BTW my present guild is small, but supportive, and growing slowly. We have all seen to many splits caused by size and ego to have this one do the same.

</FONT><HR>Abashi and some other people here are missing the point: at 50+, every outing is about logistics and organization.  There are a few exceptions (like hanging out at the zone line in Karnor's), but by and large you can't just "whip up" an outing very easily like you did at level 30.<P>If you're not in a guild, you have lost a very valuable organizational tool.  You'll be doing all your correspondence through tells unless you use the internet. (and even then Guilds use the net for organising before they organise in EQ).<P>One other thing... if you're not in a guild but 50, most people think you're a loser unless proven otherwise.

</FONT><HR>If someone goes on a raid, and they contribute to the success of the raid, what possible reason is there to exclude them from looting rights?<P>I've heard and read many accounts of these situations, and I still don't get it. Someone tags along with your guild, helps you, heals you, taunts mobs off you, whatever. Sure, they get exp and may even have fun. But aren't they equally entitled to loot as any guilded person taking part? Why shouldn't they be allowed to roll for items they can use?<P>EQ is a reflection of real life in many ways, and player greed is one of the sadder faces of that.

</FONT><HR>Well, to address another part of Gordon's comment... Yes, over time one makes friends and acquaintances in game. In fact, my highest character is only 12th level and I do have quite a few. BUT they're friends from a number of guilds. How sad. I forgot to make friends who have all the same label over their head! Stupid me. Of course, guilds are all friends! That's why, when the routers conked out this week and went in chat, there were at least 6 people each hollering in chat to get the missing 2 or 3 folks to form a guild. Instant friendships! Just add greed and stir.<P>If they'd have to meet more criterias than just a minimum number of people and were anything near what a guild should be, with the likes of guildmasters who could contribute to trade or profession training, then yes, I'd say they're guilds. Right now, I'd say you need ot join a power group that, in Verant's vision, is what qualifies as a guild.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001566.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+need+for+friends|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Well "need" in this question is not going to be the same from person to person.  Do you need a high level, large guild to go get a pair of Efreeti boots or Tranix Crown?  Certainly you do not.  Does having such a guild make it easier to whip up 6 or 8 good people to do the task?  Yes very much so.<P>However, notice that the reason this is possible is because now, many of the large guilds are off in Kunark.  Efreeti is a known and often untaken hunt.  Don't expect the same conditions if you want to go hunt Trakanon.  Its not that a group of "friends" from unaffiliated guilds won't ever hunt him.  Its mainly that they will do so primarily after the big guilds have tired of him and moved on.  After he is a known commodity like Nagafen.<P>There are many ways that a large and powerful guild helps in advancement.  There are many things they enable a character to do, often long before a smaller guild could manage a given task.  In time things even out somewhat.  But if all players were happy with the waiting factor, no one would be complaining about camping.<P>Can a small group or set of groups do the same things that the large ones do?  Yes.  How often do they actually manage it?  Not often.  Do smaller groups better maintain the "family" or "circle of friends"?  I think so yes.  Like all things, which you choose will be partly a matter of preference and partly a manner of ability.  If you want to join a large guild and you are lvl 60 with full Kunark and planar accoutrements and playtime and skills to match, it will probably be easy.  Just in saying that, most players know where they stand in regards to time, items, and skill.<P>Just don't say a large army doesn't make a difference.  It makes a very large difference if it knows what it is doing.<P>Lady Ane<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001566.cgi&ReplyNum=000018&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+need+for+friends|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I am a lvl 52 cleric.   I have been part of a small guild,,with great ppl...but you have to have exposure.  And even as a cleric as well.  Class doesn't just make the cut.  There are public raids for the bigger events like the planes and FGs.  And a small guild can survive and all lvl up in time.  Now Verant adds post 50 lvls...and it's a whole new ball game of headaches to address.  Small close knit guilds for the most part will find difficulty lvling up because the higher lvl dungeons mobs hit much much harder...and have massive HP.  What you could do b4 with some guilds member previously..now requires a real well balanced group (cleric and chanty a must).  If you have 20 50+ ppl in guild..not all are on at the same time... not all are in the same area at the same time..not all party classes you need are on at the same time.  If you don't have a full party to go out and hunt.. you are pretty dead in the water...unless you have a needed class such as mine (cleric).  And alot of classes are preferred over other...(like rangers are screwed..so much so that most ppl don't invite em in group..when they can have a warrior.  I am a veteran player of EQ.  But I know alot of ppl are quitting there chars at lvl 50 and then playing their other slots..  (Hoping Verant will open their eyes) Been hearing from ppl..why play past 50? For what purpose?  Ah..yes..new ranger armor out...yet Venril is announced for a raid..and not one ranger is invited to raid.  What a joke..the ranger that really NEEDS and can USE the darkwood that drops off the mob..can't even get invited to such an event..So what is the end result.. Someone on the raid will win the darkwood..and sell for an outrageous amount..<BR>or someone in the raid will twink their new lvl 1 ranger...  But in any case...the ranger that has played the game since day one cannot attain the items he NEEDS and deserves to get because he has put time and effort into the game (else would not be post 50). And yes Verant..I know not all loot is for all in your eyes.. but when you play everyday...and are post 50...I believe those players have shown they are not a casual player..yet are screwed by Verants as the example I just stated above.  I also know that alot of ppl that waited for the expansion..and paid the money..are quitting.  Too many I know are NOT playing on a daily basis as they were before ..because you play your char.. you try to lvl up.. you should be able to attain better armor as you lvl up..cause sure..you want it..but more importantly..you NEED to continue to lvl up... Wake up Verant.. And don't say go play UO... I have grouped with ppl since lvl 4, and so have my guildmates...but too too many ppl are finding out just how much harder it is to lvl up and move forward..with no hope in sight.<BR>You put all these wonderful things in the game...You dangle in front of ppl for the lure...with most ppl not really able to attain.  Why not I want to know? If a player plays everyday..is not again a casual players in my eyes...yet, cannot aquire these items.  Here is where the big "uber" guild comes in...Now..tell me Verant...for those who are not casual players...and where part of a "good" small guild..that didn't have the forsight of the major numbers you need to attain the things you need post 50.. For a lot of ppl it has been one BIG HUGE let down.  Being part of a small guild has now become a hinderance for far too many.  Sure some will still go forward..but too many are now starting to fall in the crack and can't go move forward. Many are plain outright disgusted with Verants additude of not all loot is for everyone.  Verant rewards "massive game time" and "uber" guild ppl for the most part.  And the "select" few outsiders.  I believe most ppl that play the game have to work for a living and cannot compete wih those who are able to spent everyday, all day, on the game, yet there are veteran players with no real reward system to look forward to. As many are approaching 47+ lvls..know what I mean. Alot of veterans can't get plane armour..let alone the upper new armor that has been introduced. So for those veterans I say are basically screwed.  If Verant CHOOSES not to address these issues at hand...they are gonna find themselves gettin dumped. Just like UO did because they ignored feedback from the players that pay the monthly fee.  I have done fine in the game...but this is the fate of too too many loyal fans of your game.  Verant ..If you snooze you loose.. Time to wake up and smell the coffee.  You have hit your peak market.  If you want to keep ppl playin need to ease up on the loot and make things more attainable for "most" non casual players at 46+.  /Ignore player feedback and we will go away.  One last thing and I am done having my say.  This game is not for the casual player and would have been nice for Verant to mention it on the box for ppl b4 making the purchase because not all ppl have alot time to devote to the game.  And again..remember.. Verant rewards "massisve game time".  Enuff said.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001566.cgi&ReplyNum=000019&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+need+for+friends|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>interesting topic isnt it!, to be uber or not, that is the question.<P>everquest is fast becoming a uber guild environment, with large guilds fighting over plains, dragons, the El, kedge etc. I have my own small guild of about 40 or so, most are level 40 plus with a few 30's and there is no way we could do hate or fear by ourselves, so i formed an alliance with a couple of guild so we could do plains and dragon raids, for all those small guilds this might be the answer to your problems concerning raids, form a strong alliance with people you trust and then learn to work together.  Mind you i also have a very good reputation and have been invited to the plains and dragons alot also, so reputation also plays a very large part in going on these raids also. The point being alone you have a very low chance of getting anything in this game, solo or loner, everquest isnt for you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001566.cgi&ReplyNum=000022&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+need+for+friends|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well, I am a officer of a "uberguild". My experience is that while a guild is neccesary to do a plane or go deep in a kunark dungeon, you do not have to be a member to join such a event. We usually have guests with us, people who are not RL or even ingame friends, but just hear/see that we are going and politely ask if they can tag along.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001566.cgi&ReplyNum=000023&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=A+need+for+friends|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">
