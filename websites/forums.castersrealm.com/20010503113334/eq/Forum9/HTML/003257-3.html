</FONT><HR>What Llarn stated is exactly right.  There really isn't a whole lot of difference between 150 cha, and 255cha.  Any high level enchanter knows the game by now.  The most important gear you can wear is you AC/HP gear next to your int/mana gear.  I'll sacrifice 100cha for 100AC anyday.  So what does this mean to you?  Put on them velium fire opal rings, heiro cloak, Crystalline Webshield, etc.  The longer you can take a beating the better off YOU and the people on your raid are going to be.<P>Plaktu<BR>58th Beguiler <Guardians of the Malt><BR>Rodcet Nife</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000050&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>My own views on this as a 59 enchanter:<P>The resists matter.  Every 3 seconds I have to spend mez'ing one mob is another 200-300 points of damage taken by the group... per mob.  Often, I will be casting while getting beat on.  It is vital to get the spell off.  And on hard to mez mobs (or when I'm spending mana on something like glamour of kintaz), resists are not an option.  Additionally, I don't bother to tash.  I'll trade the hp's for needing less time/taunt.<P>When I'm controlling a train in hate, I can't afford resists.  The whole raid's survival hinges upon me at that particular moment... resists just are not an option.  Can't have a tank dieing and losing all his buffs.  Can't have a cleric dieing.  And can't have me dieing/going OOM.  I need mez to stick, first time, without having to tash first.  That first shock as a train hits... that time it takes to bring it under control, that's when you'll lose the most people.  Anything that reduces that is good.<P>On AC:<BR>It's worthless.  600, 700, it doesn't matter.  We're hopelessly outclassed in this area against the mobs we face.  Sure, in the early 40's, it's still doable.  But in the high 40's and 50's, it just doesn't matter anymore.  Just like you reach a level at which your melee doesn't matter anymore, there's a level where your AC doesn't make a dif except against greens.  For this reason, I place AC at the bottom of my priorities, behind hp and resists (200 int/cha are so easy to get, I don't really make them a priority, they just happen).<P>Now, we're enchanters and we all do whatever we think will enable us to survive... my passion is hp and maintaning an agil that reaches 200 shaman buffed... and it probably isn't much more effective than AC.  The only real advantage is you can say "I lived with 30 hp left, my ring saved my butt!" and that's harder to do for AC <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  We pretty much all pick a few things that we focus on besides int/cha.<P>And we might as well face it, the only thing that really, really matters to our survival is the speed with which we get healed and our level.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000052&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Axterix says:  <i>And we might as well face it, the only thing that really, really matters to our survival is the speed with which we get healed and our level.</i><P>Congratulations!  You finally discovered that level is #1 most important stat in this game.  Do you want a prize?   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/biggrin.gif"><P><i>On AC:<BR>It's worthless. 600, 700, it doesn't matter. We're hopelessly outclassed in this area against the mobs we face.</i><P>And your evidence in support of this statement is ... what?  More specifically, out of whose ass did you pull that self-serving statement?<P>You know, not everyone gives up and panics the minute something goes wrong -- some enchanters are actually competent and handle those situations adroitly all the time (especially when doing something as ridiculous as farming hate at level 59).  And for those enchanters, out-of-the-ass speculation like "AC doesn't matter" is not very productive.<P>Tell me, have you ever done a CR, with no armor?  Have you ever taken note of how much damage you take when you get hit in such a situation?  Have you ever compared that to how much damage you take with, say, 770 AC?  I suggest you do, as you might find the results interesting.<P><i>my passion is hp and maintaning an agil that reaches 200 shaman buffed... </i><P>Why?  Do you have any evidence whatsoever to justify agility gear on the one hand, and discount AC gear on the other?  Oh let me guess, you once heard, "get agil gear it rox" and now chant it as your mantra?  (Hint:  I'm not only the person who tested this in the past 19 months.)<P><i>I need mez to stick, first time, without having to tash first. That first shock as a train hits... that time it takes to bring it under control, that's when you'll lose the most people. Anything that reduces that is good.</i><P>I suggest that you read a thread before replying to it.  Because what you said makes absolutely no sense.<P>Except for Rapture versus non-immune mobs, you're never going to be guaranteed to have "mez stick, first time", because there's a built-in resist factor no matter what your charisma level.  As you correctly pointed out above (yes, something was correct), level is the primary factor in determining resists and stats will do little to change that outcome.<P>So, knowing you will get SOME level of resists, what exactly is your point?  That's right, you have none.<P>The real issue here is more or less as follows:  is a 5-10% reduction in resist rates much more important than a lot more AC and HP and other things?  If you have any insights on that issue, feel free to come forward.   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/biggrin.gif"></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000053&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>The difference though is in how often you are resisted.  Reread the statistical evidence.<P>With the higher charisma the test shows that you've got a very good chance of being resisted only once.  Absolute worst case is you'd be resisted twice.  With proper taunting and spaced out casts, I can get two resists without bringing attention to myself.<P>With the lower charisma you have a very good chance of being resisted two to three times.  It's very difficult not to draw attention to yourself in that scenario not to mention the amount of added time you've wasted.<P>The end result is that with the higher charisma you avoid attacks altogether.  Your position is you can't mez if you're dead.  I agree, the lower charisma will certainly increase your chance of dieing through the extra one or two resists for every single mob.  With the increased charisma, however, you decrease your risk of dieing significantly as has now been shown.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000056&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR><I>With the increased charisma, however, you decrease your risk of dieing significantly as has now been shown.</I><P>Whoops!  I was reading along just fine till I read this.<P>How?  How has this been shown?<P>I've spent amazing amounts of time like this under both equipment setups.  Just yesterday, I'm in a pickup group in Sol B, pretty decent one, when a group calls train to zone and runs through our room.  2 sonic bats, 2 lava beetles, and 1 lava duct crawler.  AE mez flies and I pick up a resist, and the newest warrior doesn't assist properly.  I'm dealing with two bounces.  Start laying in the stuns and throw Dazzle, nailing the free sonic bat.  Greater kobold adds to the fight, deciding to rush me first.  Throw another stun series, renewing the ae mez, taking a few more shots.  Stun around again, fire off dazzle on the free lava beetle.  Drag the kobold off down the corridor, stun once and Dazzle.  Bounce. Stun again and AE mez the pack.  Mana is getting low (just buffed) so I tank through the next cast and land dazzle.<P>I sit down and call out the last mez.  The new tank breaks the wrong mez again and I get rushed.  Ker-pow... hit while sitting.  I'm thinking this can't get any more adds or I'm in trouble.  I see my life refill and thank the shaman while renewing AE... at least I can switch to single mez soon for all of them.  Add another lava duct crawler, which AGAIN decides to take a bite out of my ass.  I encounter plenty of resists with them, and fire off Dazzle.  Bounce.  Whammo.  Take a shot, color stun, Dazzle... got it.  A few words of negative encouragement and the warrior starts assisting correctly, and I'm doing the mez-med dance debating charming one of the mobs.  My life refills again.  We get them all dead when ANOTHER lava duct crawler comes in!  I color flux it, get away from the group, and root it.  It's the next mob to be fought so no reason to blow a ton of mana when I only need it in place for a few seconds.  Still... whammo, getting hit.  I go back to hold the kobold and bat while they deal with the lava duct crawler, when another bat shows up!  It rushes the tanks and I fire off a mez.  Landed.  I remez the kobold, turn to remez the 1st bat and mez breaks.  I just lost track of time I guess.  Kerpow, STUN, kerpow, kerpow... color stun backpedal mez.  Whew.  My life refills.  No more mishaps and we're all alive and well in the end.  I even had some mana built up to slow the last mobs attack.<P>Moral of this story?  My life hit below 40% twice, and below 20% once, often not even because of a bounced mez.  I had a total of 23 mezzes thrown during the fight.  At a 5-8 resist reductions out of 100 (again I saw the greatest impact vs HIGH resist mobs, not low), I could expect to have bounced ONE less time during this fight, if luck were on my side.  By the way, I was running with 175 Charisma, not 135... 135 was my low feet-wetting test.  Adorning Grace gives 40, and I've seen the CHA helps with mezzing, so I do keep it buffed.<P>That's how AC/HP gear helps me.  It keeps me alive for the general fight... not during one mez that happens to bounce.  Every time our uber-aggroing asses get the mobs attention, that AC/HP gear saves us.  The CHA gear just makes me not aggro a few less times.  I'm more concerned about the rest of the time.  You'll have to get out a pad and paper and make tic marks to see how many less times you get rushed, but you'll QUICKLY notice that you're getting your ass smacked down much faster with a cleric frantically healing you.<P>Xornn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000057&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Absolutely if you're playing with people who have no idea to assist, charisma will be next to useless because mezzing will be next to useless.  However, if assist is used properly having one less resist per mob in my mind is not insignificant.  That one less resist in my opinion saves the enchanter a lot more life and mana than the extra 150 hit points or 50 AC.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000058&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well as a low level ench you guys are discussing situations far above my expirence.  I do have a few questions though.  How much AC are we talking here? (I hope I did not miss this somewhere in this thread) I know your CHR is between 130ish and 200 but what are the corresponding AC's? second question I was under the impression AC effected how offten not how hard you got hit (granted that effects total damage taken) I have been told that AGI effects how hard you get hit, so is it important to boost AGI?. I am a newbie poster so please dont rip me if that question has been answered before. Personaly, I don't get to play much and often solo so I cant afford to give up AC/HP, unless it was to take less dmg per hit.<P>Klintos 20 lvl High elf Ench   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000060&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>To answer the above posters question.  There<BR>are two components to getting hit and your<BR>AC.  One is damage avoidance, in other<BR>words getting a miss/dodge/riposte and the<BR>mob not hitting you at all for that attack.<BR>This is what agility helps improve.  The<BR>other factor is damage mitigation, A mob_00<BR>can hit for a max damage of 130 but if your<BR>AC is high the mob_00 will only be hitting<BR>you for 60-80 a pop instead of 130 every hit.<BR>If you compare monks versus warriors for <BR>example, monks tend to avoid getting hit but<BR>when they do get hit it is for high damage<BR>while plate wearing warriors tend to get<BR>hit more often but for less damage.<P>Mandrayke</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000061&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Tumadorf:<P>A little hostile aren't we?  Had a bad run in with an uber or something?  Chill a bit, man.  It's a discussion of various points of view and just because my point of view happens to be different than yours, you don't have to get all angry and resort to child like accusations, mkay?<P>It's called maturity, get some please.  <P>>>And your evidence in support of this statement is ... what? More specifically, out of whose ass did you pull that self-serving statement?<P>I've been playing my enchanter for 59 levels.  That qualifies me to make these observations.  Consider them self-serving if you wish, I really don't care, as your opinion holds no value to me.  See the opening statement as to why.<P>>>You know, not everyone gives up and panics the minute something goes wrong -- some enchanters are actually competent and handle those situations adroitly all the time (especially when doing something as ridiculous as farming hate at level 59). And for those enchanters, out-of-the-ass speculation like "AC doesn't matter" is not very productive.<P>Let's see, calls me a farmer, assumes I have all my planar gear, assumes I panic, oh, and believes I'm incompetent.  So, let's see... wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, and wrong.  <P>>>Tell me, have you ever done a CR, with no armor? Have you ever taken note of how much damage you take when you get hit in such a situation? Have you ever compared that to how much damage you take with, say, 770 AC? I suggest you do, as you might find the results interesting.<P>I take about the same, with 500 or 690.  770 I can't tell you, I don't go up that high.  However, I do know this much... the majority of my AC comes from spells.  At a ratio of 5 to 6, we don't get good AC.  We can't catch up to rangers and they get creamed.  Anyway, run some tests, take a caster around my level with 750 AC and fling him up against something near his level... and then come back and tell me it makes a dif.  You are trying to convince people to change their views.  So you prove to them that they should.  I'm merely saying that to me, what I have works and I see no reason to change, especially not in light of any evidence shown here.<P>>>Why? Do you have any evidence whatsoever to justify agility gear on the one hand, and discount AC gear on the other? Oh let me guess, you once heard, "get agil gear it rox" and now chant it as your mantra? (Hint: I'm not only the person who tested this in the past 19 months.)<P>Here's a clue, when everyone was saying get agil gear, my warrior had crafted bracers.  People were walking around telling me "wear serpentine bracers" because that is what all the testing at the time showed.  I just shrugged and said "this works for me."  Now all the testing shows the opposite.  And everyone says "get ac".  In short, I've been focused on AC with my tank longer than most anyone else.  All those AC vs Agil tests though were run for tanks, by the way.  Nobody has bothered to test it for casters, especially not in our various configurations.  <P>It's easy for me to get my agil up to 150ish, with augment, being a gnome, and a few pieces of gear that are nice pieces with +agil, things I'd wear anyway... loam encrusted boots, loam encrusted amice, etc.  I'm not advocating for anyone else.  It works for me.  It worked really well in the late 30's to early 40's (when I had about a 170ish self buffed agil) and has since that time degraded in effectiveness... hence why I'm down to about 147.  I'm simply stating that my own goal is to maintain a 200 agil, with a shaman buff.  If any tank were to do that, I'd laugh at them though <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">     <P>>>I suggest that you read a thread before replying to it. Because what you said makes absolutely no sense.<P>Really?  Perhaps you didn't read it.  5-10% difference.  That means 1-2 out of 20.  I mez hundreds of mobs.  Repeatedly.  If you had an item that let you hit 5% more, you'd use it, right?  That's what this is.  I routinely stop 6+ mob pulls.  So, yes, it matters.      <P>>>Except for Rapture versus non-immune mobs, you're never going to be guaranteed to have "mez stick, first time", because there's a built-in resist factor no matter what your charisma level. As you correctly pointed out above (yes, something was correct), level is the primary factor in determining resists and stats will do little to change that outcome.<P>I know it is never going to always stick first time.  But it will stick more often with the cha.<P>>>So, knowing you will get SOME level of resists, what exactly is your point? That's right, you have none.<P>Sure, knowing that at some point you'll get hit for full damage, what's the point of a warrior having AC?  That's right, by your logic, there is none.  The goal is simple, get mez to stick on the first try.  It isn't going to happen, but I am closer than someone without the cha.<P>>>The real issue here is more or less as follows: is a 5-10% reduction in resist rates much more important than a lot more AC and HP and other things? If you have any insights on that issue, feel free to come forward.<P>I've already stated my insights.  It's there to read... why I believe that lower resists are important and why I don't sweat AC too much... while at the same time allowing that AC is just as effective as my ideas.<P>If you want it summed up in a sentence or two: not getting resisted as often saves you more hp/mana than any amount of hp/mana/ac will.  Or another way of looking at it: ac/hp might save you, lower resists can save you or someone else.<P>*shug*<P>I'm a high level enchanter.  I play around quite a few other high level enchanters.  And here's the only 2 things that really matter: the player and the level.  For the rest, they all have their pet theories and equipment combo's.<P>My own places ac lower on the scale than other things. except for +mana, which is a stat that doesn't interest me at all.  I'm not willing to sacrifice, hp, int, cha, and resists just to get a few items with high AC that only have a 5:6 on character conversation rate.  But, on the opposite side, I do balance it out some... I do use a idol of the thorned in ranged.  10 stam gives me hp, but I like the 10 ac as well.  I wouldn't replace it with a student's homework or something like that for instance.  You just won't see me going for gear just because of it's AC.  I try and find the best overall combination that gives me 200 int, 200 cha, high hp, and good resists/ac.<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000062&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>>>Moral of this story? My life hit below 40% twice, and below 20% once, often not even because of a bounced mez. I had a total of 23 mezzes thrown during the fight. At a 5-8 resist reductions out of 100 (again I saw the greatest impact vs HIGH resist mobs, not low), I could expect to have bounced ONE less time during this fight, if luck were on my side.<P>But how hard does an LDC hit?  A resist on one of those and you get hurt.<P>I'm not going to advocate full int/cha at your level.  I always considered that sort of foolish.  When I was at that level, I had +hp rings and quite a bit of agil gear (170ish self buffed).  My philosophy back then was "I die more from running out of hp than from running out of mana".  Other people questioned it, but it worked for me.  I do have to admit it is funny watching those same people wearing a lot of the same gear that I had then.  I still follow that belief, hence why I want things like a bone clasped girdle, resplendent robe, electrum black sapphire earrings, etc.  Once you get to planar levels though, you'll discover that getting 200 cha/int is easy, while still maintaining quite a few slots for other things.  You'll most likely find that keeping int below 200 is harder than getting it to 200.  Those same people that questioned me as to hp/agil earlier in my career have the hp/ac gear now because they have 200 int/cha.<P>This is when the balance equation gets more interesting.  AC does less for you as you level.  Unless you focus on it more and more, you can't keep up with the way mobs are gaining power.  Resists sort of steadily increase as you get gear, no biggie, unless you want to focus on them heavily.  HP also means a bit less... but also more.  We int casters get very little hp.  80 hp from a djarn's ring is a lot.  But the choices...<P>80 ac, 9 agil from Djarn's vs a 5 ac, 55 hp ring?  Well, now it's 80 ac, 9 agil from djarn's vs a 6 ac, 65 ring.  Is 15 hp and 9 agil hp worth 6 ac?  Insidious Halo vs crown of king tranix... halo could free up another slot while maintaining 200 int/cha... crown might not.<P>Which is why you end up with the gist of the discussion now:<BR>Is 5-10% more resists worth having 100 less AC?<P>And the answer to that probably relies heavily on your playing style.  <P>And, like previously, the more top end gear you get, the more both sides draw together.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000063&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think the reason Tudamorf got huffy with you was because of how you started your post.  You said you are 59th level and that in Hate resists simply are not an option in a train.  Do you play in the same Hate I do?  At 58th level I don't even break a sweat there unless there are at least 10 mobs in that train.  Anything else is nothing.  At 59th level, mobs are coming extremely close to being green.  One night we even enjoyed watching a 56th level druid solo a Cleric of Innoruk.  And no, they didn't kite or root park.<P>If CHA really does help resists by 10% or whatever, the only time I would ever worry about increasing my CHA would be when doing Myconids.<P>My normal stats where 780-790 AC, 2300 or so HP, and 165 CHA.  I had the same CHA a year and a half ago when I hit 50th level but 200 less AC.  Yes I've had 200 CHA before, as early as 40th level.  I just never saw the point.<P>Wandatin Dai'Noga</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000064&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>No, blunt would have been your last post.<P>Hostile was the first.  That's why you have things in there about farming, etc.  Dragging in unrelated points isn't blunt.<P>>>It always annoys me when people speculate about an issue then post the result of their speculation as if it were fact. If you don't know, say you don't know. If you're guessing, say you're guessing. If it's your "feeling" from casual observation, say so. Don't say "this is the way it is" without having tested it or having damn good evidence to support the statement, because all you will end up doing is misleading others.<P>My problem stems from the opposite side... when people blindly believe anything just because others have "tested" it.<P>You know what has been tested?<BR>AC/agil on tanks.<BR>Str on tanks with max skills against blues.<BR>Dex.<P>Now, all my observations pretty much agree with what those tests have shown.  As I said, I was going the AC route because of my 'feeling' that it was better when everyone else was absolutely sure agil was better because the 'tests' showed it to be so.<P>All our tests have really shown?<P>AC is better on tanks.  However, keep in mind that only tanks can achieve a comparible level of AC to mob attacks.  In another post on the crucible... you stated something along the lines that atk/ac is a combo of 2 skills+ level vs ac + level.  And that is pretty much right, except that it is 2 parts of offense + level vs 2 parts of defense + level.<P>The strength test was also interesting, showing that it's only really good for allowing for higher max hits, but doesn't increase the % of those.  However, the interesting thing that came to light out of some related tests is the idea that maybe strength makes up for having a skill that is too low.  Nobody, however, has done any testing to confirm this or the implications.  For instance, does strength only help you come up to your max skill level?  Or is it based upon what you are fighting?  Or is it level based?  All of these things have serious implications.  My gut feeling would be that what you are fighting doesn't matter, just seems a bit too complicated to have to figure in each time.  Now, if it lets you come up to your maxed skill, then it wouldn't be too useful once you max your skills.  If it is a simple level based system (such as calculations are made and then capped at some number), then strength could potentially benefit people that have low skill caps (like casters or paladins/sk's) more.  But none of this stuff has been tested.<P>Other things that have not been tested:<BR>2 parts of offense + level vs 2 parts of defense + level...<P>From my experience, the conflict between these two leads to reaching a breakpoint of sorts, similiar to 100 dex, 125 dex, etc.  Get a certain amount of AC and suddenly tanking that mob becomes much easier.  It's also been my experience that stat debuffs are most effective when they take a person who is barely below the breakpoint and alter the equation just enough to put them on the other side.  Hence, why at the low levels, as an enchanter, stat debuffs worked very well for me, but as I levelled, they became less and less effective, especially as tanks became more and more heavily armored.  I fell behind the curve too much for the stat debuffs to help me... the tanks either ignored AC and were too far behind or were far enough ahead that it didn't matter.<P>Anyway, what has never been tested is the implications of being below, significantly below the equation on the AC side.  Does the avoidance part of AC help more then?  Or the absorbtion?  We don't know.  Does agil work in a fashion similiar to strength to help make up for low defense skill?  Again, we don't know.<P>All these things haven't been tested.  Some of them are very hard to test.<P>So, yes, until these specifics are tested, we can't go by more than gut feelings.  Until we take an int caster with high agil and compare him to a high AC one and compare him to a high hp one and chuck in a balanced one into the mix as well, we don't know.  Until we throw those guys up against reds, against low blues and against whites, we don't know.<P>All we have are tests on other things that people just have a "feeling" applies to these things as well.<P>In short, don't say "this is the way it is" without having tested the specifics as they apply to these cases.  You'll only end up misleading others.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000068&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I don't know Tudamorf's AC, but I imagine like other high level Enchanters that focused on AC that it was a little below 800 AC.  The reason he says it is difficult to test the benefits of AC at that level is that even though we perceive to take damage less it is hard to test because we still take damage pretty quickly by mobs over 50th level.  It is hard to take a large sampling of data when you can still go from full health to dead in 30 seconds or so.<P>Let me give you an example of why I perceive higher AC to be better without the actual data to back it up.  Doing a Trakanon raid with 2 Enchanters, myself and another.  Both of us are highly skilled, and I know the Clerics in both of our groups to be extremely reliable.  We get a pull of 4 Juggs.  Each group engages one, and both of us Enchanters get one to mes.  We each get a resist on the first cast, and the other Enchanter is dead before they get their Jugg mes'd.  He had around 670 AC and I had around 790 AC.  This was an actual situation that happened, and after I got mine mes'd I got his as well.  Also, I had my usual 165 CHA and they had just shy of 200 CHA.<P>This is my whole point in this topic.  Resists are just far too random to rely upon whatever bonus CHA gives.  I would much rather be able to withstand a fast, hard hitting mob for that 2nd cast of mes.<P>Wandatin Dai'Noga</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000072&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>There are sooooo many variables that could have contributed to that... different HP total, maybe you had more rune left than he did, the cleric healing the other enchanter hit a second long lag spike, the other cleric accidentally hit the wrong heal key or targetted the wrong person, or just a couple lucky high rolls for the jugg.<P>And for testing, I reiterate not everyone is 50+, some of us care about tanking ability pre-50. :P  I'm lvl 42 I can get buffed up to 1800 hp and I can tank mobs hitting for 80 max for a while. :P  And while it would be nice to do a continuous test against a single mob, it would be sufficient to just grab long duration logs of a camp and compare performance with various AC.<P>Arlina</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003257.cgi&ReplyNum=000073&forum=General&TopicSubject=Charisma:++A+preliminary+|QUT|mez|QUT|+report.">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">
