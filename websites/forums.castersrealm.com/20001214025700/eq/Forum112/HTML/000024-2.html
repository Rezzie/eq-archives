</FONT><HR>play what you find fun, the world would be very boring if everyone was an Ogre Shadowknight, i personally play an Erudite Sk, because nothing on Norrath looks cooler then them period, and ive been around EQ for long enough that i know how to play effiecently, and Erudite Sk, who goes all out AC (jagged bands instead of +5 dex +5 str ones, Darkforge or even silverpladed bracers instead of the lowly serpentie bracers etc...) can tank just as well as anyone else.  The downfall of most medium races is they try to compensate for their low stats, sacrificing AC, and AC is king period...<BR>as for the lower HP, yea so we are down a few hundred HP at 50, we are also up a few hundred mana, thats one more lifeleech so it all balances out...<BR>The bashing problem can be overcome by "ghetto bashin" a intresting techninqe where you switch you slash with your 2 hander, then using hot keys, switch to shield, bash and switch back to sword before the next round of combat... ive done it quite effiently and it works, play with it.  <BR>anyway to sum up, there is no BEST race, everyone can get to 60, you just have to play smart and well informed, the AC tip is the best anyone can give a tank (that and always have a set of resist gear on you for casters)<P>ps from personal experiences i feel dex is more responsible for weapon skill increases, int affects spell skill increases, not positive but pretty sure</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000024.cgi&ReplyNum=000026&forum=General&TopicSubject=Are+SK+mute+or+what|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>As one poster mentioned, the only player race that is "stun-proof" is the ogre (npcs such as cykes and hgs also have this gift) and groups really notice the extra damage the ogre warrior or sk in tank mode is dishing out instead of taking because of the stun immunity (this is not to disparage other sks, one of my buddies is a troll sk, and he's way cool imo).<P>on another note, just saw this on main eqcaster newsboard:<P>"Why do you think are so few people playing shadow knights? I am very interested in your theories. <P>Good question. I was quite surprised to only see one SK at the gathering. We've several people playing them here and they are typically enjoyed by all. I'd guess that it's primarily the faction issue. <P>I'd like to see a lot more people playing them. People frequently ask for a melee character that can solo, and the SK is certainly more capable of that than any of the others. <P>- Gordon"<P>Of course there was no link for ppl to point out the obvious to Gordon --> its the darn PERCEIVED XP DRAIN info thats going around (whether real or imagined) that has made sks less desirable in some groups and made fewer ppl want to start up an sk.<P>If the XP DRAIN is true, then I firmly believe it should be fixed, pronto!<P>If it is not true, then VI should come out with the numbers so ppl are AWARE of this.<P>As things stand there seems to be a lot of anti-sk discrimination floating about.  I truly hope that is more my perception than reality, but I doubt it.<P> <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000024.cgi&ReplyNum=000029&forum=General&TopicSubject=Are+SK+mute+or+what|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>BAH... Dark Elf Shadow Knights just plain ROCK.<P>One more thing to mention AC is not GOD.  I used to think that before i got some AGI/DEX jewelry and I found I was getting hit for significantly less damage.<P>Basically instead of getting hit for 120 80% of the time I now get hit for 60 (50%), 30 or less (25%) and max dmg 120 (25%).<P>This is very significant since my ability to be hit also decreased by around 20%.<P>This means I can tank longer and am more useful to the party.  If you think AC is god try it out for yourself using jewelry AGI/DEX in place of STR/INT and see the difference.  My AGI went from high 90's to 120 and with a shaman AGI buff it just gets better  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>Kaitan (Nightmare Clan)<BR>47th Shadow Knight<BR>Karana Server<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000024.cgi&ReplyNum=000033&forum=General&TopicSubject=Are+SK+mute+or+what|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I play two Shadow Knights, a 9th Level Iksar and a 7th Level Erudite. They are both /very/ sweet. I enjoy both of them for the looks, as well. I have several other characters out there to keep me interested so that I don't get sick of SK's (which seem to be my focus and love at the moment). Both characters don't seem to have advanced far enough to really start shining, but they are both very enjoyable.<P>Honestly, I stopped playing my Iksar SK because of the plate mail thing. If just scared me off for a while. Then, after looking at many different things, I thought, "Well, it seems like the only way to go is with a troll or ogre." It didn't seem my style though, as /everyone/ seemed to be playing those races. So, I went with Erudite, because the concept seemed /so/ cool. So, the Erudite, unless I use some of this Ghetto Switching (that is inventive) won't be able to bash with a big two hander, and blah blah blah... but I have learned that I enjoy characters that aren't the "best" race-class combination (in the popular view). I have a halfling warrior, seriously, just for fun. I'm going to start playing my Iksar again (my first character), and keep both characters around for variety.<P>SK's are fun. Every race has it's own pluses and minuses, and everyone has their own priorities (I went with "coolness" concepts, in my own eyes, with both characters).<P>So, all in all, this has been very informative. Thank you very much, everyone, for your imput.<P>Paul</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000024.cgi&ReplyNum=000035&forum=General&TopicSubject=Are+SK+mute+or+what|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I play a level 45 human SK --- and I have great gear, high AC, and use a mith 2hndr.<BR>I think alot of the stuff I am reading is very interesting.  I can solo blues, that's all, and not all of them, all of the time.  I think SKs are vastly underpowered, and many of you are going to get a big surprize as you advance in levels and you find you are dependent on others to play.  I travel with a shaman the same level as me, so I am advancing ok.  I dislike having to leech points off the shaman since both of us know the stuff we are fighting she could handle herself.  Neither one of us has all that long to play each day, so we are sort of conservative, being careful to not die and lose ground.  I feel SKs need more hitpoints (buffed I am almost 1700 now) better AC (buffed I am over 800) and hit harder and faster, just like the lousy blues I am fighting can hit me.  Our pets at my level are not worth casting, as if they get in the fight it is over for them in two rounds or so.  Our damage shield cant be exchanged for other buffs to players, and it only is a one time 55 or so that is about a round in duration.  I love my SK --- been at it since the game started --- but I started a shaman who has gotten to the same level in a fraction of the time.  This game will end with druids and necros ruling the world --- the vast majority of the SKs I have known in the past year plus have ALREADY abandoned their character and began another more fun class.  And before you go on about how much fun the challenge is, forget it.  I want to have fun, that's all.  And dying when outmatched is not fun.  When you have to group to take a blue --- you are underpowered.  Shiel Somethingorother in North Karana can be feared easy, but when she turns she going to get 119, 91, 91 hit points in wham, wham, wham --- how come if she is a lousy level 40 I gotta try to match that?  I am not doing that with MY sword )</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000024.cgi&ReplyNum=000036&forum=General&TopicSubject=Are+SK+mute+or+what|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Here are some replies to previous posts :<P>* Ogres cannot be stunned from the front, it's a racial ability.  I have a both ogre and troll chars, ogre has never been stunned, troll is stunned multiple times in combat<P>* XP distribution in a group is based on your current xp, not level, so a SK will get more xp from group total than her level will indicate.  (Hybrids and monster races have xp penalties)  Check out this site to see xp required for level by race and class :  <A HREF="http://hackersquest.gomp.ch/html/xp/xpchart.html" TARGET=_blank>http://hackersquest.gomp.ch/html/xp/xpchart.html</A> <P>* STR is not just the amount you can carry, it makes a difference on your ATK.  It's easy to test, just look at your ATK before and after casting a syphon str spell.  On me at least, it went up by 5 or more points.<P>* While at my current level I can solo whites and some yellows, but I am not indestructable.  I also have a mage who is much more powerful at the same level (solo-wise, I mean)<P>* Your pet is not worthless, it is a tool for soloing.  It is not designed to take damage, but if used correctly it can greatly increase YOUR damage output.  Turn off it's taunt and think of it as a walking DoT.  At 12th level it increases my total damage output by up to 25% if equipped with a rusted 2h (up to 20dmg a pop).  The higher level pets can bash also, so that helps you when fighting casters (2 bash instead of 1).<P>* Each race has it's advantages and disadvantages, but the Troll SK has the biggest xp penalty for a reason.  I heal twice as fast as other folks (4hp/tick rather than 2hp/tick).  I slam for 8-10dmg, added to the 30 or so from my 2h slasher, and 10-20 from pet, that's up to 60dmg per round at 12th level.  Not too shabby for a girl.  The way I see it, I can get mana and int items, but items that duplicate these abilities will be much rarer/noexistant.<P>* As for soloing ability, SK is the best melee soloer because of her ability to (fear/darkness) reverse kite as well as having a pet.  If you're having trouble soloing, maybe you should alter your methods =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000024.cgi&ReplyNum=000037&forum=General&TopicSubject=Are+SK+mute+or+what|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well, All I gotta say is that there isn't a <b>BEST</b> race for SK, I like an ogre SK myself. Here is why I choose the Ogre. (Note: this is all just my opinion) <P>* <b>Erudites</b> already have a lot of casters, so it wouldn't be very rare to see an erudite with a skeleton pet, and they have horrible night vision, and make pretty weak tanks till you hit 9 or so. Also, I dont like wearing fancy clothing.<P>* Pretty much the same thing with <b>Dark Elfs</b>, cept they have ultrivision, but they are hated in most places. <P>* Thats also why I dont like <b>Humans</b>. Even if they do have exp bonuses and are liked in a lot of places, I still dont like em. <P>* Now, the <b>Iksar</b> are a pretty rounded out race. Night Vision, Good stats, and awesome newbie areas, but they cant wear plate mail armor.<P>* <b>Trolls</b> are a good choice, Basically same as Ogres.<P>* <b>Ogres</b>, you gotta love em. Its  sooooo amusing seeing a character that weighs around 600 pounds sitting around reading his "Necromancy 4 Dummies" book. While feeding his skeleton pet cookies that he found on the ground that some how keep reappearing.<P>... And thats why I choose the Ogre ;)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000024.cgi&ReplyNum=000042&forum=General&TopicSubject=Are+SK+mute+or+what|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I have only recently ventured from my home in the city of Paineel to embark upon my life as a Shadow Knight of Cazic-Thule, and after reading your various posts on this topic, I deemed it necessary to interject my input into this.  <P>Plainly put, Brothers and Sisters of the Shadows...what difference does it make?  We have all been chosen by our repsective deities to undertake a task in his/her name.  THAT is what is important.  Not whether we are Human, Dark Elf, Troll or Erudite.  We may be of different lineages, but we all walk in (and with the Darkness) and are hence, all equal in the eyes of our patrons.<P>Having said that, I bode you all happy hunting and may all of your blades bring chaos, fear and desperation into the lives, hearts, and more importantly, beliefs of all those who oppose our mission.<P>May Cazic-Thule not turn his baneful gaze upon thee and thine...<P>Nazrael<BR>The Midnight Sun of Cazic-Thule<BR>Initiate of Three Seasons<BR>Prexus Server<P>------------------<BR>People of Norrath, prepare thyselves for the rising of the Midnight Sun!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000024.cgi&ReplyNum=000043&forum=General&TopicSubject=Are+SK+mute+or+what|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">
