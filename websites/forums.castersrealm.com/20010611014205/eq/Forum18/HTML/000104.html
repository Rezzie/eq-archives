</FONT><HR>I'm writing this obviously in hopes of getting at least a look through by Verant.  Having heard that they want to be completely done and have all class balance issues locked by first quarter of 2001.  Hopefully the information here will let them make a few decisions about the future of enchanters.  <P>We're one of the more sought after classes in the game this is true.  You don't hear a lot of complaints about our class.  They are out there but I seem to notice a lot less ranting from us.  Personaly I'd have ot think this was due to the type of person that plays an enchanter and not the overall strength of the class.  Don't get me wrong.  I'm 51's level at the moment and even through the rough times of playing I believe it's an overall fun class to play.  But are we a balanced class?  Lets take a look shall we?  Here is the complete run down from 1 to 60.<P>Levels 1-3<BR>What can ya say?  Your a newbie.  As far as the class goes so far, one of the better ones.  A fresh pet that's only down side is that it takes xp.  He's cheap to cast and has decent strength for being a level 1 spell. You do however get one of the most useful spells of your career for the next oh 60 levels.  Minor Illusion.  A simple yet very effective method to safely med just about anywhere.  <P>Taper enchantment, Well it does what it says it will.  Just have yet to see it be useful.  maybe if it actualy removed something now instead of a week from now.<P>Weaken,  partialy useful if your in pvp.  But let's face it, str debuffs are completly useless on Mobs.  Maybe if they were actualy weairing anything or had anything to carry it might.  <P>Lull,  Handy spell.  Once you get about 4 more levels you might actualy use it.  why bother in a newbie field?  May as well make it a level 4 spell and be done with it.<P>True north,  also handy because your sense headin skill at this level is pathetic. and you get a bonus of having good Div skill.  usefull later on.<P>Levels 4-7<BR>Enchanters do very well in the beginning game.  The pet at this level is very useful if you wanna solo some stuff.  And some new abilities make that even easier.  You get your first buff that you can hand out and invis.  very nice at such a low level.  And of course the illusions.  very handy if you started as an evil race.  Of course the cherry on top is Mesmerize, your first crowd control spell.  Learn it, live it, love it.<P>Color flux, your first stun,  handy for levels to come.  good for interupting spells.  Unlike a lot of spells though,  the lower level version is not your friend as you level up.  This one works like Verant actually says spells should.  The higher level ones are harder to resist.<P>Tashan a must have for all chanters just about all the time.  Lowers magic resist so that you can actualy hit something with a spell.  Just about the first spell all chanters cast in all fights up to level 60.  (Of course at higher levels you cast the bigger versions)  I have yet to see ANYTHING resist this spell.  Wish that were true for a few others hehe.  but it would be fair.<P>Suffocating sphere, Takes a bit longer but if you look at it it's one of the highest damage spells out there for this level range.  Even a wizzie has to cast twice to equal it's damage. And oddly enough iit even does it's damage fairly quickly.  Quite a unique effect for enchanter dots.<P>level 8 to 11<BR>Here's where Enchanters have to slow down a little.  but then so does everyone.  Critters are a bit tougher and you have to think about what your doing a bit more.  No more grabbing a couple buffs and solo'ing reds.  by 11th level your down to white at best without kiting.  And that's with buffs.  (Not uber buffs mind you, but what you could get at this level)<P>Alliance, Not likely to get you into any new area's by itself.  but will get you better prices from vendors that don't like you much.  I still use the same spell off the quest item for better prices here and there.<P>Cancel magic, this one comes in handy a little later on.  occasionaly at this level range.  Good for removing those damage shields to save your pet/tank the hurting.  Also handy a little later on if a groupmate get's charmed.  remove the charm before they remove your health bar!<P>Chaotic feedback, was more useful before they made it partialy resistant.  Sure you get nothing from the resists, but the always full damage paid off more.  Thank you staff of writhing... On a side note hope folks have saved up some training points...evocation is rough to get going.  Once you hit about 30 skill it moves decent.  but can be hard to get there.  Also, do we really have to have that INSANELY long recast time on all our spells?  yeah, we're not supposed to be major damage dealers,  but would a 4 second recast make us that much more powerful?  No, it would save our buts and put us in line with other pure casters of our level.<P>Sentinel, hehehehee.  OK done laughing.  I can type now.  In a rare occasion I have found it useful.  Cast it about 50 yards off in 3 different directions and med in the middle.  It used to work but now the effect seems to follow you instead.  Might be something I'm doing.  But when done this way will give you a bit of warning before that cyclops/hill giant ruins your day.  that is if you can stand the constant annoying spell effect as it goes off.  Maybe if it only had a message when cast and when triggered would be better.  Also it would be real nice if it didn't aggro creatures.  Killed myself in the middle of a wedding ceremony one night becuase the guards took exception to it...  So much for the carpet of light.  Good place for a revamp guys.<P>See invis.  a lot easier for getting your invisible group across an area if you can see  each other.<P>A new pet spell.  Would be nice if it had at least half the hp of the same level mage or necro pets.  We already take a hit by not being able to control him.  at least he could take a hit.  And how about a nifty spell effect?  At this level I don't even care if the effect does anything.  Maybe a random proc of a double attack once in a blue moon.<P>Level 12 to 15<BR>New abilities and a new world for the enchanter yet again.  I do like that enchanter tactics have to change a bit with every spell level.  Makes the class more interesting and more of a fun challenge to play.<P>Bind affinity, handy for gather cash at this level,  aka binding for donations.  also of course keeps you close to your corpse and makes getting home that much easier when you can decide where home is.<P>Charm, well here's a death wish waiting to happen.  Handy as backup crowd control spell when you have a group.  Personaly I find the charm series WAY to dangerous to use when solo.  I'll get into that later though.  For now let's just say that in a group it's real handy if you can use that extra mob you pulled as an extra tank for your group.  Even if you have no idea how long it will last.  it's worht it.<P>Choke does nice damage for this level.  I find the damage on all the Chanter Dots to be right where they should be.  Not monster dots like a Necro.  But decent damage.  Plus a bonus in Pvp situations, they have a nice debuff on them.<P>New Illusions!  Finaly the good race Enchanters can get into some evil area's with the Dark elf illusion.  Too bad some of us chose to have a god.  Mobs have no idea what race you really are but somehow can tell that you worship someone they don't like.  You tell me, when was the last time you could tell a baptist from a protestant by sight?<P>Whirl till you hurl,  This is kinda neat to play with.  Then later on you dicide to actualy fight the mobs instead of playing with it.  The effect is nice.  The resist rate is insane.  not to mention the mob breaking it and a round or two later you see the "has broken" message.  Well according to the waste of your health bar you already knew that!  If it's going to be a stun,  then STUN, and stay that way.  Mezzes break when you do damage.  that's how they are supposed to work.  This is actualy supposed to stun.  Or at least spin.  Only seen the spin work once myself.  Gotta get REAL lucky on the timing.  Would be a useful spell if the resist were about half what they are.  As is,  it sits on page 50.<P>Serpent sight useful for the Erudites.<P>Memory Blur, handy for those Mez/blur/LEAVE times.  Also get's mobs off you quicker.<P>Languid pace,  now here is a truly useful spell.  I'd still give it up for snare, but no enchanter should be without this one.<P>Thicken Mana. Can a level 12 Enchanter actualy get this spell?   Not gonna spoiler the location.  You'll have to ask me in game if you wanna know.<P>Level 16 to 19<BR>Here's where most enchanters find out how rough life can be.  Don't worry though.  It's just the beginning of your corpse retrievals.  And oddly enough we are very well equiped for getting our corpses back, via invis and or illusions.<P>Breeze. Hey your level 16, it works.  You don't have much mana so it doesn't take long to get back and this helps out.  good spell.  Bought it at 48th or so just to have it in the book.<P>Chase the moon.  Get yourself a buddy with snare and your in business.  Great spell for the level.<P>Disempower,  again only useful in Pvp.  That stat difference it makes on mobs is so pathetic that if you need it to survive then you best find something easier to fight.<P>Levitate, you don't have Air elemental illusion yet.  This get's you by and you can hand it out.<P>Mesmerisation very handy spell for very many levels.  Mezzed myself more times than I care to count.  Managed to mez everything around me one time.  Then we all got to sit there and stare at each other for 18 seconds until the fight resumed... Usualy the mobs that did resist it is the one that comes over and pummels you to death for trying.  All in all it's still a useful spell though.  Would be nice if you personaly had a bit better chance of resisting your own mez though.<P>Rune 1<BR>Handy bonus HP.  costs a little bit.  But it's worth it on many occasions.  Never used it much myself.  But saw many enchanters use it quite effectively.<P>Sanity warp.  Good damage for the level and the mana cost is right on target. Same problem as all our DD spells though.  Recast time is nuts.  <P>Our new pet.  Is it just me or does it have even less hp than we do?<P>Quickness,  nice little spell.  wish it lasted longer than the casting time on it.  Seems to run out before the fight is finished just about.  would 20 minutes be asking that much??<P>Level 20 to 23<BR>Here the enchanter get's kind of a false sense of security.  You get a bit more powerful compared to the mobs you are fighting and you almost think you are a decent class again.  until you see the druid kiting by you with a red on him or the necro taking a nap while his pet solo's a blue.<P>Benevolence  Our next faction buff.  This one might actualy get you into an area if you are only slightly kos.  And of course get you those better prices wich are all important for practicing that jewelcraft and spending every last dime you will get for the next 30 levels.<P>Berserker Strength.  Now this is a handy spell.  would be a lot nicer if it stacked with other strength spells but I'm not looking a gift horse in the mouth. I usualy used this one to solo by chain casting on my pet.  With the pet's pathetic hit points it actualy keeps him alive.  Just don't fizzle.  He'll be dead by the time you recast...<P>Calm,  now here is a spell to get you killed.  Don't bother.  Just get yourself a druid with harmony and let them pull it.  Or a cleric with simple lull.  They seem to have better luck at it. And if they fail at least they have some hp to survive a little while.<P>Color shift, This one is still at the front of my book.  quick simple AE stun. Interupts spells and gives you just enough time to cast a mez.  Don't expect to get anything else off though.  it doesn't last long enough with our again insane recast times.<P>Illusions,  Troll is a very handy one for that extra regen.  Iksar would be nice if an enchanter with a religon could actualy raise faction enough to get into town.<P>Sympathetic aura.  Handy for lowering the all important Mez resists.  and for getting better prices. on a side note prices max out at around 120 charisma.  if you have good faction that is.<P>Crystallize mana.  Can't wait to see a use for it... And again is there any way for an enchanter of this level to actualy get the spell???  Just curious.<P>Tahsani a must have of course.  resist rates across the board are rough on enchanters.<P>Levels 24 to 28<BR>Ok here we go, this is where enchanters get powerful right?  Must be some good drugs.  Improvements to old spells and your first elemental illusion. <P>Pet is getting more and more worthless by now.  Dies faster than you can cast him.  would more than 3hp's be a touch overpowering?!?!?<P>Strip enchantment, usefull for making sure you get rid of that damage shield.<P>Chaos Flux,  good damage,  resist rate isn't even that bad.  Wish it could be cast more often.  recast times are a bear.<P>Beguile the new and improved death wish.  Same usefulness as the previous charm. Just now you can get bigger mobs to rip your head off.<P>Level 29 to 33<BR>Ok,  here is where the enchanter actualy starts getting offers to join groups.  You get your new spiffy buffs and some new abilities.<P>Augmentation.  You got a tank?  your casting it.  nuff said.  yeah Alacrity is faster.  It also takes a lot more mana and doesn't last as long.<P>Clarity where enchanters get thier reputation.  Handy if you need a sow.  and druid/shaman wll trade ya for it and your groups will love you for it.<P>Curse of the simple mind.  Now here's a useless spell.  Absolutely and comepletly worthless.  Did I mention that it doesn't do much of anything useful?<P>Dyn's Dizzying draught.  Take all the shortcomings of Whirl til you hurl.  Multiply them by 100.  Takes WAY to long ot recast, doesn't actualy stun the mob, and has an insane resist rate.  Oh yeah love this one.<P>Enstill, ever seen a shaman or a druid cast root?  Why doesn't this one work like those?!?!?!<P>Feedback, was genuinely suprised when I saw this spell.  Didn't even know about it until I was 30th level.  Nothing huge but it's a nice spell to have.  Good job verant.<P>Illusions.  Air elemental gives a free Levitation.  Water Elemental is great for places like kedge or anywhere else you wanna swim deep for a while.  Too bad they will both get you killed in any town now adays.  <P>Listless power,  need we go on about the uselessness against Mobs?<P>Suffocate, good damage, nice debuffs in pvp.  Could we knock about 30 seconds off the duration and keep the damage the same?  No, this is not asking too much. Take a look at Immolate the 29th level Druid dot.  Nearly the same effects as Suffocate but thiers works in 1 minute flat.<P>Ultravision,  your human groupmates will love you in the dark.<P>Do I need to mention the pet's have next to no hp's?<P>Level 34 to 38<BR>Enchanters are finaly scribing that all important money sink of enchant platinum.  Entrance finaly has you at the top of the food chain for crowd control.  If you happen to have velious your friends are going to like Gift of magic.  And Rune 3, your runes are starting to mature into some nice little buffs.<P>Anarchy nice damage, resists are on the believable side.  Same problem all our DD's have though.  8 second recast time is just WAY to long.  Yes it's a megataunt just like all our other spells.  but if you don't know how to deal with taunting creatures by now, give up, your never going to make it as a high level enchanter.<P>Entrance, as I said before.  This is the spell that makes you the man in crowd control.  nothing at this level tops it.  Very well done spell.  don't change a thing.<P>Insipid weakness, yet another spell that enchanters put on page 50 of thier spell books never to be seen again.  Maybe if it actualy had a visible effect.  make it quadruple the effectiveness and cut it down to about a 30 to 45 second duration.  might actualy notice it on a mob then.<P>Radiant Visage is even better for getting those prices down and helping to make those charms  stick.  Mezzes also benifit greatly from a good charisma.<P>Rune 3, it's really not that many hit points when you look at it.  However it always seems to last a bit longer than you'd think it would.  Very useful for throwing on your puller just before he heads out.  Or even on your pet if your going to solo something rough.  Gives you time while the creature is beating on your pet to get a slowing spell off and get ready to chain cast berserker or rampage at higher levels.  I have the next rune myself but still use this one simply because it's cheaper and get's the job done.<P>Mana Sieve, welcome to page 50 with the other useless spells.  Even tried this one in Pvp...Not worth the waste of mana.  Maybe if it gave back some of the mana it stole or stole enough mana to make a difference it might be useful.  As it is, you'll never have a use for it.<P>Levels 39 to 43<BR>Enchanters get thier first wisdom buffs here.  A new charm spell is in the line up and even a new lull.  <P>The new Pet!  Is just as pathetic as the rest of them.  The damage output on them is perfect, right in line with where they should be.  To bad 3 hits later they are dead.<P>Celerity, I actualy cast this one for a little while,  but you run into the point where your  tanks have haste items and they are just hitting the speed cap.  Not to mention the duration on this little bueaty will run you outta mana fast.  Stick with Augmentation and everyone will be happier in the long run.<P>Insight, nice little buff.  Not worth casting by itself. You end up using more mana yourself than you are handing out.  However I have found that if you stack it with Gift of Magic it comes out to a tidy little sum of mana.  if your in a group of pure casters then hand out these two with clarity and your ready to rock.<P>Invoke fear, same as your other fears just that much longer duration.  Grab a friend with snare and your set.<P>Pacify, death wish in a spell slot?  Ever since they made the resists on the lull series aggro creatures this whole line has been useless.<P>Resist Magic, Would have been useful about 20 levels ago when you were facing Evil eye's in the gorge and watching your group tank kill everyone.<P>Wandering mind, I don't have this one yet myself, however, looking at the reviews I'd have to say folks like it.  It's not useful everywhere, but handy where you can use it.<P>Distill Mana, sounds like a cool spell.  Maybe one day it will have a use.<P>Levels 44 to 48<BR>Here is where enchanters finish thier spell book,  sure there's lots more spells to come.  But they are all more of the same, just upgraded versions.<P>Boon of the garou, FINALLY!  An illusion we can hand out.  Drop this on a dual wielding tank or rogue and watch the fur fly.  if they have weapons with effects on them all the better.  Yeah it only lasts 10 minutes and has a 6 minute recast time.  It's worth the wait.  Next to our mez and clarity series this has got to be one of the most useful spells we have.<P>Tashania, fun little quest.  Does the same thing as the rest of the Tash series.  It's a required evil though.  Without it, your in trouble.<P>Pillage enchantment, good spell.  works better than just about any other at this level.  would be nice if it cast a little faster seeing as you usualy want to get this in quick at the beginning of a fight.<P>Level 49 to 60<BR>Yup that's right I grouped the entire rest of an enchanters life into one section.  Don't worry it doesn't change much from here out.<P>You've got your pets, the damage output on them is right where it should be.  to bad 3 hits and they hit the floor.  Leaving you with a pissed off mob.  a next to worthless root, and no snare.  Hope you did the Jboots quest, cause now you get to run like a girly man.  By this point you should be pretty used to it though.<P>Berserker spirit/Rampage series,  It continues to improve and is one of your best pet buffs.  It's the only way you have of keeping him alive.<P>Dazzle/Mez again they continue to improve.  However don't ever expect to be able to mez anything in the giant class.  That would obviously make the enchanters useful.  Can't have that.<P>Enchant Mithril/Brellium/Steel and so on and so forth.  My blacksmithing is moving along fairly well.  Might even get to see the stats on some of this stuff later on.  Fun series adds depth and challence to the smithing trade.  I hope to enjoy gathering components as time goes on.<P>Gasping Embrace/Suffocate/choke Our dots.  Do less damage in more time than any other class in the game!!!  I really can't complain about the damage output on them.  It's just about right actualy.  I wouldn't mind a bit more, but that's not what would really make them useful.  What would make them actualy reach a spell gem is if they would do damage in less than an HOUR!!!  I can take a nap waiting for a dot to finish.  That is of course if I live that long.  I know my pet won't.<P>Swift like the wind/Alacrity/Celerity  Thank you Verant for Gimping us so well.  Can we say speed cap???  The duration on these spells combined with thier mana cost makes them all but useless.  SLTW comes in handy on pets.  It's the first one that actualy lasts a decent amount of time.  Too bad it takes soooo much mana.<P>Re-occuring amnesia, Cool idea.  Fits right in with the enchanters image.  Needs to be a bit more effective though.  Blanket is more worth the mana than this on in all circumstances.<P>Shadow/Umbra/Obscure Nice little Ac buff.  stopped casting it around level 12 when i met my first cleric.  would be nice if it stacked with cleric or anyone elses straight ac buff.  as is.  I use it so rarely that it's not worth the time finding it in my spell book.<P>Group resist magic.  Right on target.  good resistance and the mana cost is right where it should be.  Would love if it lasted longer but I'm not gonna complain.<P>The Rune series.  Good series of spells.  Cost makes it less useful, but again, I can't complain.  They come in handy.  I've never saved someones life with them, but the time may come.<P>Augment/Augmentaion/Visions of Granduer.  Good series of spells.  the speed on the is on par with what a speed buff should be and they have a good mana cost/duration.  Too bad they are going to page 50 when I get my Epic item.  They will be handy to have until then though.<P>Root/paralyzing earth/Fetter and so on.  Is it just me or is there a whole different table to Shaman/druid roots and everyone else?  Thiers work and ours don't.  nuff said.<P>Clarity/Clarity II, Perfect spells.  absolutely nothing wrong with them.<P>Theft of thought.  Handy spell in certain areas.  Good job.  Wish there was a series of these.<P>Tashan/tashani/Tashania oh you get the idea, Good series.  very useful not only to enchanters but to mages and shamans so that they can get a real debuff to stick.<P>Languid Pace/Tepid deeds/Forlorn Deeds, Wonderful series.  I'd give them up in a heartbeat for a snare of the same percentages.  But then again.  That would make necro's look bad.  Can't have that...<P>Color Shift/slant/skew Great spells.  would be wonderful to have one with a range at lower levels.<P><BR>I think that just about covers everything.  (it's kinda long and I got tired of writing in the middle)  If someone at verant actualy reads this I'll be happy.  I don't even care if they respond.  Just please read it.  I do also have a few wish list items.  nothign to do with currently implemented stuff.  Just stuff that would be nice to have.<P><BR>Pet control.  Not the typical /pet attack stuff.  We aren't supposed to get that.  But a spell to cast after we have cast either charm or summoned a pet.  It would make us BE the pet.  Hot key skills, having to turn on attack, hit the kick/bash buttons and so forth.  And of course due to bind sight we would see through the pets eyes.  Basicaly a complete possesion of the creature.  It should have a higher resist rate than charm.  But last until we run out of mana,  constantly using mana while it's in effect.  Or something along those lines.  It shouldn't be able to last as long as the max duration on our charms of the same level.  About half duration, but stick to it's max duration more often than Charm does.<P>A second line of dots.  Instead of choking make it a line of migraine headaches.  some kind of debuff on it.  be it speed/stats whatever and medium damage.  Around the range of about 70% of what our current dots do but able to stack with them.  What's this you say?  extra damage for an enchanter?!?!  Damn straight.  I'm tired of knowing that if I run may mana flat out over then next 5 hours I still couldn't kill the warrior standing next to me unless I gravity flux and let his own weight kill him. And I don't wanna hear "But you have a pet"  the pet has no hit points, doesn't work in Pvp anyway, and is just plain too damn dangerous in most areas.<P>A Theft of thought series.  Throw in more of those wandering mind spells.  great idea those.  They don't work everywhere because there aren't casters everywhere you can cast them on.  but they add a nice touch to the class.  A higher level more powerful one wouldn't hurt either.<P>Thank you for taking the time to read this.<P>Cheers<BR>Corvidae Sightshifter<BR>51 Illusionist<BR>Tiers of Destiny<BR>Bertoxxules<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=18&topic=000104.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=The+Definitive+Enchanter">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Nice.<P>Couple of comments though. <P>1) You neglected to mention the wonderful mobs in Velious that are lower than 56 but above the boltran's level cap-and are mez immune. Which leaves DICTATE as your only option for crowd control. Isn't that supposed to be our focus? Yet if you're not 60, you can't do anything to these mobs.<P>2) Agro from our MR debuff series is insane. Casting this on a large mob so the shaman can land malosi line/slow is an enc death warrant 90% of the time. Wait longer to cast? I've tried that too. Oh well, at least I have a nice collection of 'enchanter as tank' screenshots, unfortunately I had to scroll my text box back to take them after I finished loading back to my bind point.<P>3) 'Uber' dungeons such as Veeshan's Peak, Temple of Veeshan. I've got no problem at all with the difficulty/challenge of these places, but could you guys at least have humored us and made the lowest level mob there 59 instead of 60 so the enchanter has something to do other than listen to everyone whine that their clarity icon has started blinking? Oh wait, we can run and try to camp if ever TWO mobs come. I'm not asking to be able to charm Silverwing or Hoshkar...but does anyone else remember that racnars USED to be lower than 60?<P>Velious is what made me stop playing my enchanter after 60 levels and a year of involvement in multi group, high level raids. <P>Sinadilye<BR>Phantasmist<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=18&topic=000104.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=The+Definitive+Enchanter">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Ouch! im lvl 41.  I have considered starting to focus playing my lvl 30 pally on bertox but.  Now it seems like the right move to make.  Only thing is Ive spent soooo uch time with my chanter!  I am in Velious now and grouping is just terrible.  I hate camping orcs.  I just plain die their.  Ive camped them 4 times and had 3 deaths, Due to either root mez or just slow recasting times to get the mob off my back after I tashani it. Let me ask a question.  What does the lag pace series actually do.  I know the mob does not attack as fast.. but does it slow down their speed any like snare?  I have not noticed.  I was trying I repeat trying to solo a snow griff the other day!  I know they hit hard!  I was prepared.  I had my dd up celerity for pet rune 3 for me and pet, root, fear and tashani.  Oh and lang pace or what ever the one i have at 41  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">.  I root griff (no tashani)  dont have too many probs with root.  then tashani, slow and weaking.  DD time! 288 dmg root breaks.  Griff hits me.  Pet on it 5 secs pet rune breaks recast... DD.  griff hits me.  recasat rune on me.  Pet rune breaks.. recast.. low mana i sit for a sec. pet rune breaks. pet dies!  as I said I was ready for this.  Oh i do not have jboots or sow!  Griff attacks rune absorbs blows and breaks all the while im trying to cast fear!  Griff hits me for 50 78 misses hit misses I get fear off and off to the races it goes.  I sit mem gate.. gate and sit again mem invis. invis and run to the Crystal caverns zone.  Made it with only a bub and a half life gone.  The whole fight took lil over a 1 min majority of that time was me debuffing griff before actual engagement! Why does it have to be like this for us for me!  If I cannot find a group what is there left for me to do?  make jewelry?  Check out all the stores in Thurgain?  I was in CC one day trying to get into a group.  There was a group camping the queen.. and they were not full.  I asked if I could join and be any assitance. They told me no but I would be cool if I went to where they were and gave them clarity!  What the Heck!  There is always a need to a healer, a tank, but us if there is no need for "crowd control"  what do we do then.  If I had snare at least I could solo.  I spend so much mana trying to solo and the down time is just horrific!..  I can kill some mobs in like a min.. using DD with pet but then im  oom.  I just too discurraging.  As I stated b4 im lvl 41 I have been playing this char since June of 99!  Heck if I cant find a group why play.. cant solo worth crap.  And all that stuff about soloing a bunch of specs at 1 time doesnt work if you aint got sow or jboots or if your charm only last for 5 seconds!  I didnt realize weaken was pathetic.. I sure wont waste the mana on it for now on!  I dont know why so many of our spells are useless.. maybe its not just ours... maybe all spells for all classes need to be reajusted or just thown out if they dont work!  I just really hate that other classes can do "our" job better than us.  It would be like a pally tanking better than a warrior or monk!  It would be nice if our illusion SOW gave us SOW... you would never here me complain again!!!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=18&topic=000104.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=Rants+and+Raves&TopicSubject=The+Definitive+Enchanter">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum18&number=18&thisthread=000104&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum18&number=18&thisthread=000104&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
