</FONT><HR>One positive note, the economy is getting so flooded with items on my server that prices are falling thru the floor. Examples from 12/99 compared to 5/2000 in rough prices:<P>Splitpaw Gloves: 450 now 50-100pp<BR>RS Chestguard: 1200pp now 600pp<BR>Serpentine Bracer: 150-200pp now 50pp<P>I hunted off and on in unrest from level 22 to 33 (all exp gaining levels too). In that time I have gotten 16 jagged bands, 2 BS tunics, 5 BS mantles, 10 savants caps, 4 ivory bracelets and an untold number of festering cloaks. <P>Grrr, still no dwarven workboots though.<P>That sheer volume of items has to drive the price down. Heck, every single mid level warrior I see has an Exe Axe these days.

</FONT><HR>This is not a casual game.  Time is required for everything, especially the good items.  Items DO matter and those without some of the more necessary items can not compete no matter how smart they are.  If you don't have mana for another heal, it doesn't matter that you knew one was needed...<P>Despite Gordon Abashi's assertions, some classes are more balanced than others.  If some classes can solo and others can't, it's not balanced.  Those classes that can't solo are forced to group, spend time finding groups and dealing with the things necessary for effective grouping.  Casual players will probably be less frustrated with classes that can solo for reasons in so many other posts.  The game should say something to this effect on the box.  <P>Camping is frowned upon by Verant, yet they designed the game to force camping for some equipment and quest items.  Most design tweaks lead to more camping and more frustrating situations, not less.  Casual players can not invest the time required to get the items, possibly can't raise the cash, and even in they could raise the cash many items are no drop.  This all means that at higher levels they will not be as effective solo or in groups.  Again, the game should say something to this effect on the box.  <P>These things really would take a lot of Verant's resources to fix.  We each only pay around $10/month, so with the number if new players vs. players leaving amounting to a 70% retention rate, what do they care?  Why should they care even if 100 people quit the game when there are hundreds of thousands of users?  I think a casual player would be more likely to leave the game than a 40hr/week player, so Verant caters to their reliable income, the powerplayers and uber-guilds.<P>Only way to get Verant to listen is to mention $.  Send them a note that you and your friends are cancelling your accounts and will play a different game, and do it. Otherwise, they've got you where they want you, and now they're gonna eat you.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000076&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Verant has always catered to the non-casual gamer, and always will.  The VERY LITTLE random loot they put in Kurnak was to relieve camping issues, not to benefit the casual gamer.  I really don't feel anything to this point has been done to help the casual gamer's enjoyment of the game.  I too was a nightly player for many many months.  As with most adult players eventually that has to stop, and real life creeps in.  Had I not spent all those hours (100+ days played) playing every night for hours on end, I would have never gotten the items I have now.  My 50 cleric would be crippled in many ways like:<P>-Not as much manna from wis items.  I could probably cast one less superior heal or one less Retribution per fight.<BR>-My armor class would be that of banded mail.<BR>-I would rarely if ever use symbol spells on my group, let alone myself, because I could not afford the reagents.<BR>-It would be almost 2x as hard for me to solo because of the lack of STR, DEX, and AGI I get from my items.<BR>-My skills would most likely suffer as well from the lack of INT my character would not have.<P>All in all my 50 cleric would be about 60% effective as he is today.  Heck, he might not even be level 50.  Now that I play only a hour a night, and a few hours on weekends (&lt;20 hours a week) I find my bank account dwindled to nothing with all of the money sinks in this game, and I also find I nearly impossible to get any new items for my class.<P>You can argue over and over that Verant has tried to cater to the casual gamer, and I will not believe it, as I see it with my own eyes every day.  My character has the best non-planar items that he can have (pre-Kurnak) and has little or no hope of ever gaining planar armor, or some of the nicer items in Kurnak.<P>No, EQ does not cater to the casual gamer at all.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000077&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I love the game, but the way the game caters to the hardcore 40+hours per week gamer is absolutely infuriating.  I've recently come to the realization that I'll never hit 50, much less 60.  It's taken me since June of 1999 to get 23rd level, and I've been told that I've done well, given that I can play maybe a total of 8 hours a week.  Some of us have lives to take care of.<P>My main complaint is that because I can play so few hours, people who I group with one day have out-leveled me by the time I log on again.  If I'm lucky, I can hang with a group of people sporadically for two weeks:  At the beginning, I'm 2 levels above them, and in 2 weeks they're 3 levels above me.  So there I go again, trying to find a new group to hang out with.  &lt;sigh&gt;<P>One thing that this game really lacks is a communication/mail system, so you can keep up with people you meet even when your schedules aren't the same.  I can adjust my schedule to be in a particular place when something is planned ahead of time, but I usually find that when I log on, whatever event is already underway.  So, I spend half an hour or so trying to find a group instead of playing.<P>Pardon my ranting, but there's just no way that Verant can say that this game even pays a half-second's thought to the casual gamer.  We pay every cent as much as the 'lifers', we use up less bandwidth because we're not on as often, yet the game continually surprises me with the incredible slant towards people who live for the game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000078&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Absolutly not. You cannot even get in a solid group camping nothing at all much less a Named camp(after lvl 35) unless you can devote blocks of about 4 to 5 hours minimum. Most all people can do this, but at the cost of thier personal Relationships and work performance. So a person that has Ballance in thier life does not do well past level 40 since EQ is an incredible time sink.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000079&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I can see that we have a lot of people here who have no idea what RL is like.  They equate the casual gamer to the guy who works 11 hours at Taco Bell, and the continual gamer who can camp the ultra-rare items to someone who can afford a house in Malibu and a red Corvette.  <P>I work no more than most folks, 40 hrs a week.  I did not come out of some "prestigious" college like Harvard or Yale, University of Florida actually with a B average.  I make enough money to afford a Red Corvette and I could live in Malibu if I wanted to, Denver is way better IMHO.  It is not required by any means to have no life and just a job to afford those things.  It is required to have no life and just play EQ to get the ultra-rare items.  The casual gamer will never see them.  Heck I had a hard time getting an obsidian shard.  I just don't have the time to spend to do those camps.  Now that guy working 11 hours at Taco Bell while living in his parent's basement?  That's another story, he has nothing but time.  Ditto all those college students not going to class on Daddy's nickel.  Don;t pretend they aren't out there in multitudes.  They are and they both have no concept of RL.  That isn't to say by any means that all power players fit these molds by any means.  I know at least one who is level 53+ who works a full time job and is married.  He doesn't have any other hobbies, but that's not a big deal.  Even he is the first to admit though that he is not the average Power gamer by any means.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000087&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well i'm a level 43 wizard, and unlike you all I have two accounts (two computers) and I have a lvl 43 Druid also.. I dont have the time in the day to complete quests that "I" want to do. Now i consider having two computers cheating but i felt like i had to have two computers to get my Wizard to a high level. I have done NO, None, Zilch quests, and my armor/items are no higher than lvl 25ish items. So you really dont need the "Cool" items to get the job done. I have noticed in my EQ venturing that It is not worth it to camp for the items, and that is if it is even possible.. i dont know about the people above but try to camp a 8hr. spawn when your a light race in Guk on a PvP server, Hahahahah! Class items on a PvP server='s impossible!. you cant do it unless you camp the "server login" screen and wait for the players to drop below 300people to go into Guk, but even then there is always a Darkrace your level around.. Camping items sucks and camping items on PvP sucks even worse! So just dont worry about the items until you find that your character is not quite powerful enough for what you are doing. Hell I put all my stats on Strength for my druid (stupid mistake) and he still can solo fine without the mana of 90% of the other druids out there.  I cant wait for lvl 46, then i will be parked on the planes. It is the first level my wizard can get "wizard only" armor.. Hahahah.. 46 lvl's later.. it is a mean joke by Verant. <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> be safe all. <P>Solairian Astroblaze, 43 wizard, Tallon Zek.<BR>Whalric, 43 Druid, Tallon Zek.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000088&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Point Blank, It really has nothing to do with being a casual gamer, or a EQ O'Holic. It has to do with a game replacing...or trying to replace real life in our minds. Do you realize there are people that play almost 24 hours a day 7 days a week? These people have replaced real life with a game. Which is ok. But some of us want to play EQ without giving our real lifes up. So where does that leave us? We are shoot out of luck. Almost ALL the quests are long and require a ton of time I would rather give my daughter. So we play....don't worry about "Camping" or "Questing". We just log on..all three of us, and play for a few. And slowly but surely as the time rolls by, and the "Power gamers" spread out even more, Test Center fills up....me and my two comrades drift further and further away from Verants Vision(tm). Soon Diablo 2 will be out and EQ will fall by the wayside for alot of people, and if that's not your fortae' AC is alot of fun =) So basically what I am saying is let the "Professional" Veggie people dump 1000's of hours into EQ and lets not complain anymore. Verant's not gonna change...why sould they? They are making a TON of money off those people's "Lives". And I say Life is to short to waste it camping a virtual "doodad" in a Virtual World for 100 hours, when you can be doing much cooler things irl or on your puter. Sides....you don't really NEED all that "neato wowzer" stuff to get levels in EQ, it's just "nice" to have. =)<P>D</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000089&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>The only reason Verant won't add muli-part quests for items is because they fear it will render the camps they have at the moment unworkable.<P>Why wait to get in a camp for that Ghoulbane, which might take 18 hours solid camping, once you do get your place there, when you can get the item from doing a 6 part quest in three hour segments? Plus there would be many more items coming into the world as multiple parties would be doing the same quests, at the same time.<P>Well why not make it take 2 or even 3 times as long as the single camp. I for one would not mind that it takes much longer, in game time, if I at least had a chance at the item. The original camp would still be taken by the power gamers who want the item asap too. <P>Make the items no drop too, or all your going to see is more druids porting around running these quests and selling the items for stupid amounts of plat to the people who should be getting the enjoyment, and exp, from doing there own quests.<P>No, I don't think all items should be do-able by everybody in this way, but for those items that do require huge amounts of resources, either sequential time or bodies involved, they should not be so much better then the necessary equipment per level. At the moment the early powergamers, with their equipment which not all is now obtainable, are like gods to the rest of us. No way anybody of a similar level should be so powerful. Better yes, just not so much to make the rest of us pretty much unwanted in groups.<P>Verant messed up bad early on, and are only making things worse. Witness their insistance that classes are balanced. Well yeah, that there meat shield will usually last just long enough for the casters to do their stuff. Seems pretty balanced then, doesn't it? <P>Oh well, why bother, we all know they don't listen anyway.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000090&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Get real Verant and Sony! Any quest item by the time it can be obtained in its intended fashion is essentially worthless because the character would have out grown the need. It's now a grey market in the game to get necessary items.  The ones who can get the items have camped for hours, days, weeks, months(?) to get them.  It's obvious who the game is intended for, not the casual gamer.  At least be honest about it and admit it, or go become a politician.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000091&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I read Abashi's reply to the casual gamer issue, and was pretty offended at how he totally missed the point.  The problem is that almost ALL the quests are unreasonable in terms of time required.  It is NOT an issue of "deciding what you want and making a decision to spend the (unreasonable) amount of time to get it", as Abashi stated.  I also play around 20 hours per week, which I feel is a reasonable level, and am constantly annoyed that I must ALWAYS miss out on the more interesting aspects of teh game because I cannot spend entire days camping one in a series of NPC's to get quest items.  The game certainly seems designed to make playing a user without the "special" quest items almost unplayable in most of the zones past the starting areas.  I must say, that in my many years in the computer industry, I have seen this "don't care what the customer thinks" attitude cropping up more frequently, and rarely in companies with any long term future.  IF Abashi and his cohorts are happy with their current profits and such, I guess that is good for them.  Too bad for the rest of us though, as I feel EQ has a LOT of potential that is being completely ignored in preference of fluff fixes.  I guess someone else will have to come along and do it right....hopefully soon!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000092&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think EQ is fine on drops. You can always buy the items after all. I can camp 90% of the things I have on me (and things I don't) but I choose not to.<P>That's because I don't want to waste time, I think playing the game for 6 hours doing nothing is a waste of time. If I'm spending 6 hours of my time, I can easily level (given I'm not in hell....GUH)<P>So, I think that if you really want something and you want it the most EFFICIENT way (that is, you don't want to pay). Then you try your luck at camping.<P>But if you want an item, and you want to just get it and go on with your life (in both senses). Then buy it. It really doesn't take that much to learn the etiquette of trading. I have gotten fairly good at it. Why, just yesterday I sold my Runed Falchion for a DWB and 500pp. I then bought a CBB and traded the DWB for Gatorscale leggings. I then sold my unused Black Chittin Leggings for 600pp and my unused PBB for 200pp. With the remaining 1300pp. I bought another RF for 1k. That means not only did I just get better stuff. But I just made 300pp that day. And now I have 500pp to spend on something else.<P>It's really not that hard.<P>So next time you complain about camping...try other alternatives. You'll find that they really are a lot better sometimes, than camping for hours on end.<P>Well, that's my 2 cents.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000093&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I used to be fairly hardcore, I'd play like 6 hours a day after school and a lot on the weekends, but after exp became slow I became pissed... Why in the hell should it take 50+ REAL time days to get to level 60... Verant made this game to be basically group only to keep people longer, I will not crucify them for that, but group experience is so slow, why should I feel elated if I can get a level in 12 hours of play time, that is retarded.  I am an enchanter, and it still takes me a little to get into the best exp group, because there are many other enchanters, and I could solo, but the only real way to do that is charm level 45+ stuff that runs almost SOW speed, needless to say, downtime sucks...  Now take a system like UO (I know UO sucks now, but Beta and Alpha were GREAT)... you spend even 10 minutes in UO and you get something accomplished, 1 hour, hey even more accomplishment... with EQ you can spend up to 1 hour just trying to get into a cozy group to exp up so that you can go to the planes and get phat loot.  I just wish that EQ had less level requirement or decent soloability.  IT IS a group game, but everyone should be able to solo to 60 if they want, and group for the hard stuff.  Like I doubt a level 60 necro could still solo anything in hate, because of the summoning abilities and the lack of room for fearing it, but if the necro wanted to get something from good ol' Inny, then well, Woot, they have to get a group, thus the grouping.  I'd hate to know what some other people would go through to get into a group... I mean I am fairly well known on the Rathe and I get invited to a lot of groups when I do the shout, just imagine some poor guy who is totally unknown because he had been playing with a core group of friends that aren't on... poor bob the rogue... who would want him?  He spends 2 hours to get into a group only to get into a group that yields a bubble every 5 hours just because that is the best he could get into.  <P>To put it roughly, it will take anyone not being powerleveled, not exploring that much, their very first character, 45 days played(of being in a group getting experience) to get to 60. <BR>45x24 = 1080 hours<BR>A casual gamer plays 20 a week, 15 actually being in a group, the other 5 travelling around looking for groups.<BR>1080/15 = 72 weeks...<BR>That is 72 weeks of pure leveling, doing nothing else but leveling at pretty decent experience spots, is that really fun?  I'd say no.<P>What would be nice would be say, 20 days worth of pure group experience to get to 60... this means BOB can get to 60 in 8 months, that leaves a lot of time to play before he became bored out of his mind of the game.  Leveling just keeps the addiction going, blah blah blah I am tired, and that is all I have to say.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000094&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>In general I think that long quests for items is perfectly fine, though I certainly agree that 4 2 hour quests far outstrips the utter monotony and usual impossibility of 1 8 hour quest (too many people want it - serious invitation to KSing and frustrating weeks on end waits to get your turn.  That 8 hours turns into 80 because of the 10 other people in line in front of you)<P>Unfortunately, I think that the game is tuned so that by the time you are sufficiently powerful to get those items, they are considered mid to low end items for you (i.e. quest rewards are really designed for higher level chars to do them & sell to lower level chars).<P>Certainly some classes are more item dependent than others - ALL melee types require the best weapon(s) and armor they can find.<P>Clerics (and to a lesser extent other healer classes) require the best armor they can get because of healing taunts.  I know about this one personally, because my original character is a 15th cleric who has banded and a few worse pieces, who died frequently as a result.  My 20th druid, in full reinforced and 2 jagged bands with a cracked darkwood shield dies MUCH less frequently.<P>Enchanters HAVE to have a decent amount of charisma to get any of their spells to stick, though a few hundred PP are sufficient to get you there.  In addition they (along with wizards) probably need the best armor of the int casters, since their spells taunt so much.<P>All else is relatively optional.  Int and Wis casters can always use more mana, but mana recovery rate is far more important than total mana in general, except when soloing.  I read once that if you're constantly draining to OOM you're doing something wrong.<P>With all the new items from Kunark coming into play, I think a lot of the old stuff will devalue considerably, making it fall more within the price range of the people who can actually still get some value out of it.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000096&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I agree with the few of you here who enjoy EQ for what it is. I have played since day one, have 14 characters and am just now over 20 with one of them. And she still wears many of her first level items. I play lots too, at least 4 hours a day, 7-12 on the weekend days. This game is fun, meeting new people is fun, making money and getting items is a side effect of all of that. I hope I get some Ubergear someday, but I will wait until it falls in my lap, or until I can put together a group of friends and go get it.<P>Think back to D & D. Would you GM have let you twink your ass off at level 1? Would your GM have said "Oh yeah, your right.. this quest is too hard, and too long... Ill just give you the sword of big pile's of death!" Well Mine would have just killed me off in shallow pool of flaming acid and told me to deal with it. I think (honestly I do) that people who constantly have problems with the game not being what they want, and are never satisfied with the adjustments to their character (I hardly ever notice a "nerfing") really should save their 10 bucks a month, cut the cord and go on with life. No game should make anyone so bitter, and upset... about anything! It's a freakin GAME.. and mostly no one wins, so there is no losers, so no one should get upset! Granted there are times to get upset, if your character is deleted, or some chump trains a giant on you, but those are pretty rare occasions.<P>Live long Verant, there are a few out here who think your pretty swell!!!<P>EQ Forever!!!&lt;Or at least till somethin prettier comes out = <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif">&gt;<P>Jasmeen</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000097&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">
