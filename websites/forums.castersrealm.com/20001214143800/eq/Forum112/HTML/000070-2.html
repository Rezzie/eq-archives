</FONT><HR>I agree on HT needing a look.  As a lifetap it would be the bomb --- probably make us too strong though, and then "they" be wanting to nerf us back.  Right now, I never use HT unless I need it for a last ditch taunt for my partner's life.  I bet all pallys use LoH much more than we use HT at present.  If it is part of some SK's game plan to use it with regularity, you can bet  it won't be there when they later need it most.  Also, I hate the agate's needed for Shieldskin --- seems unseemly for a Knight to be lugging those gems around just to cast that newbie wizard spell.  I still use it though --- anything that will help me get exp is OK in my book --- I just wish it either was a more powerful spell or that it didn't need an agate each casting.  And I hate my pet.  It dont last for squat --- one or too stray hits and it gone to skel heaven.  Lastly, I sort of laugh every time I see a poll and they got us down as a class NOT to group with, or as a class not wirth playing.  I am plenty good at what I do, and with a shaman as a regular partner --- we create havoc on the mobs )  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000025&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>If you dont like the class you are playing, or thinks its difficult, go play another class. I have a level 43 sk, with just 51 days played on him. It took me awhile to figure out all the little tricks, but at level 40 I was soloing sg;s in SRO with my pet reverse kiting. What other class can do this. I necro at level 40 doesnt even come close, druids dont think so. Play around with your character , see what tactics work for you and your equipment, and if you die, run back get your corpse and find the thing that killed you and return the favor. It is all about fun , and my sk's is it. I play and enchanter, cleric, warrior, and shammy. All of them are level 40+ and the sk is my love. He has made a name for himself, and although I dont always get groups right away. Everyone always says hello. Wake up and play your class, and learn all the little secrets.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000026&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>No SK can compare to a necro --- that's why there are so few SKs and so many necros and druids.  Everytime I see a post from someone reverse kiting stuff way out of their level, POST level 35 (when melee takes a whole new harsh reality) and with OUR lame pets, I got to tell you I can't see it.  You imply you are soloing --- I been there and the downtime is not worth it.  And we ain't got THAT much mana or that many hit points to keep up with that kind of damage.  As for going back to get your body --- right --- I don't get killed.  Something kills me it was BAD.  Because I got the health and mana(based on how I play) to Feign Death always.   </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000027&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Even with more mana that we recently acquired, soloing for sk's suck. My char is lvl 42, I can solo hill giants, spectres, and sand giants. But what is the point? By the time I kill one I am way down in health and practically no mana left. We shine in groups, I don't care what you guys say. Bah, who cares that monks can fd faster then sk and necro. I still fd pull and got more hp and ac. And since I'm usually grouped, even more hp and ac for me. <BR>My only complaint is that in my opinion hybrids are not warrior enough. To be specific, my real gripe is Archery. Getting capped at like lvl 75 in archery is a joke. <BR>I like to pull with arrows rather than cast a spell, especially since most of the time my arrow's range is greater than my spell's range. It's just sad that I miss 6 times out of 10 and only do 1dmg with a massive bow and arrow combination. It would be nice to just round the cap out at 100 for paladins and sk's. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000028&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Mindless, you just don't konw how to play the class, I've played my SK up to 20th so far, and it has to be one of my favorite characters.  What I would recomend you do, go to a newbie zone and practice you fighting and spell combo techniques and learn how to play your character till you can get it right.  I group with an enchanter on a regular basis, and the two of us rock, when she can't fear the mob, I do, after I cast clinging darkness on it of course.  The SK is a very versital class, and even at 20th lvl, I can still solo a gamble via fear kiting with my pet.<P>------------------<BR>Dragonpriest<P>Even the dragons need someone to show them spiritual guidiance.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000029&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>First of all, SK's ROCK!!  Absolutely the funnest char to play.<P>In response to the HT/LoH comparison, HT does damage, LoH heals.  LoH is meant to save yourself or a group member.  HT was meant to hurt the mob.  These are very different gaming strategies for very different characters.  It wouldn't be very fair if a SK could just walk into a zone HT a mob to kill it then walk away with the loot.  Like most of these posts have said, SK's were made to be a challenge for the person behind the monitor.  I feel they very well balanced.  <P>Oh, and for the person who started this thread and for those who've told me that SK's are a watered down Warrior, my pet and my spells and me can dish out way more damage than any Warrior and have much less down time.  The only thing a Warrior has that I don't when wielding a 2HS is kick, and my pet alone does more than that easy.  <P>And for those who were wondering what a good partner for a SK is IMHO...Dwarf Rouge.  I can keep that mob on me and with the Rogue BSing, that mob goes down so fast you'd have thought we had a limp-wristed-headless-chicken-running Wizzy with us.  <P>Bluudtoof says "O yar, me sexy!"<P>Bluudtoof Hoocheemama<BR>Sexy Troll SK of the 23rd circle<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000030&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

But I will agree with the majority of posters here, any class/race is only as good as the person behind the keyboard.  SK's are better than all the other tanks because they have more OPTIONS.  SK pets are dots, not tanks.  My 2hs does as much damage as a warriors (minus the crits and such).  And my spells are far from weak. Fear kiting is far and away the most powerful strategy in the game.  In the countless groups I've been in (that's right, I've never had a problem getting into any group) I'm often the primary snare, primary puller, and at times the primary healer (a troll can work wonders with dark empathy).  Using the right combo of spells SK's are THE best taunters in the game.  As long as Bluudtoof is around, my dwarven rogue will have backs to stab.  All you naysayers need to sharpen yer skills and shut yer whiney mouths.  In the future, I'd suggest paying no attention to the board trolls, they simply thrive on all the attention.<P>Grindlespine</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000032&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Yes, you are totally right.  SK's are for people who know how to play 'em.  So we can't cast as hard as a caster, and we can't melee like a warrior. Who said we were supposed to?  If we could, everybody would be an SK.<P>What we can do is...<P>If we're getting crushed in melee, step back<BR>while your pet takes the blows and fire off a darkness/fear - what warrior can do that?<P>If we're getting nuked by a caster or magic mob, step in and bash, then melee away while they are stunned.  Ever seen a nec do that?<P>If you use all the stuff we get intelligently, an SK shouldn't suck.<P> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by bluudwyrmbait:<BR><B>Twinked ass?

I never said anything about liking a 68% XP penalty.  I just aint going piss about something that is not going to change.  Learn to deal with it.<P>As for most shadow knights that suck because the player sucks.  Well, call it flame or whatever, but it is my opinion and I state it again.  I have played nearly all of the melee classes (other then Bard and I am not sure what they are) and the Shadow Knight is one of the most dynamic.  I see posts like "Harm Touch Sucks", "Our Pet is a Joke", or "Shadow Night Spells are Worthless".  The shadow knight is not any one of these things, but a combination of them all.  The players that don't get this and try to play like a pure tank or caster are the ones with 'Shadow Knights' that suck.  So again I say, "Most Shadow Knights that suck are played by players that suck."<P></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000033&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>That's nice for you on your server --- I fight mostly blue mobs, and they are ALOT tougher than a fellow player.  I am hard pressed to keep up with the damage, and solo I tend to sit alot, and when (and if) I am grouped I just fetch and back up tank.  I am just past level 49 now, and I don't see what all we got, keeping in mind we chose this high difficulty so long ago.  I shudder when I think of soon fear kiting some mob all by myself that has 5000 - 8000 hit points.  All you eager lower level Sk, I wish you luck.  I have several OTHER characters in mid forties and they are MORE powerful than my SK ever will be.  You will find this out for yourself, later, as you see higher level SKs quit and/or switch like me to other characters.  Hybrids are broken, and no one cares - it is part of the "vision."</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000036&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I only have a relatively low level troll SK, and as far as melee goes, there isnt a huge difference between a SK and most melee classes.  All have strengths and weaknesses, warriors have slightly more hp, ac and can critical now and then, SKs get spells and a pet.<P>One of the biggest problems we have is this totally uncalled for experience penalty.  It makes soloing pointless because we suffer the whole penalty ourselves.  At higher levels groups will refuse to take SKs, Paladins and Rangers because the experience penalty the individual has chosen is passed onto the group.  I know this from experience.  I've been there with my druid and shaman and know what people say when a SK wants to join a group.  Why pay through the nose when there is no need.  FD pulling isnt really necessary if you have an enchanter in the group, lets face it enchanters are breeding like rabbits nowdays.<P>Most high end groups have clerics and enchanters in them, our strengths are obsolete when others do things just as well with no extra experience loss for the group.<P>Let me show you why:<P>A group consists of a level 45 Dwarf Cleric, Halfling druid, Highelf Enchanter, Woodelf Rogue and a Human Warrior.  Currently the experience is distributed 20.6%, 19.6%, 22.7%, 18.6% and 18.5% respectively.<P>They feel they really need the services of another 'tank' class and to deal with the really tough mobs.  Bob, a 50th level Troll SK and Jo, a 50th level Dwarf Warrior are looking for a group.  Who will they add?<P>If they add in Jo, the warrior, their share of the experience drops to 16.1%, 15.3%, 17.8%, 14.6% and 14.5% respectively.  Jo's share of the experience would be 21.6%.  Jo would only be earning 3.8% more than the highest previous party member.<P>If they add in Bob, the Shadowknight, their share of the experience drops to 13.6%, 12.9%, 15.0%, 12.3% and 12.2% respectively. Bob's share of the experience would be 34.0%. Bob would be earning 19% more than the highest previous party member, more than double the experience he receives.<P>How many intelligent people would figure in that situation that the SK is worth a third of the group experience?  How many would choose the SK over the Warrior?  Answer is not many, and alot of high level SKs spend hours looking for groups.<P>There is no reason to have the experience penalty.  Warriors, Rogues and Monks are more than viable and comparable to Shadowknights in offensive capabilities with their disciplines.  It is the only reason why SKs suck, otherwise they are fun to play.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000037&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Okay..... whenever i make a character i always try to pick the class that everyone thinks "sucks" and everyone hates.  Why?  a) i like the challenge b) it is more rewarding when i succeed and c) we are the most likely people to get an upgrade =P.<P>That said.....  over a year and a half ago i made an enchanter.  They were considered to be the worst class in the game then.  You may not believe me, but it's true.  Now... she's level 53 and i've played several other characters up to around 20.  Never tried a Shadow Knight until recently.  The reason i picked one is because next to clerics, SKs are an enchanters best friend.  When a mob is mezzed 3 times or more, it tends to become VERY angry with the enchanter.  However, a skilled SK throwing taunts, dots, darkness and melee at the mob will usually have the thing off me in seconds. They've saved my life more times than i can count.  Now, on the brand new server, i started a SK.<P>She's a bit frustrating at first, no one to buy from, medium PW is a pain in the arse to find in the beginning (those pumas hit hard!) and seeing 103 people in North Ro is just a painful experience.  However, she's level 10 now, and movin right along.  <P>That's just my 2 cp worth, although i really had nothing to do with the post topic.... ahh well.<P>Autumn Blight 53 enchantress, Prexus<BR>Sepulveda 10 Shadow Knight, new server =P<BR>Slyght Blyght 23 rogue, Luclin<BR>Depth 15, Cleric, Luclin (?)<P>hmmm, i play this game wayyyyyyyy too much<P>------------------<BR>AuTuMn</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000039&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

I was following conventional advice, Lake Rathe, South Karana.  Bah!<P>I found a new joy in playing my character in the Overthere.  Get there.  Hunt the Northeastern shore.  Great exp, loot, and a golem to run to when it gets bad.  Darkness, fear, and whack whack whack.<P>If you find some friends to play with, go to warslicks woods and the giant fort.  I went there at level 25 and never left till I hit level 31.  Made about 1200 pp in weapons and loot and came up with 3 forest loops in that time.  Forest loops are great trade material and I get will get over 1000 pp for each one <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>Level 30, what gift from the planes.  Everyone calls level 30 hell level.  I think levels 1 through 29 were hell.  30 was my first real glimpse into the darkness of our craft.  No, hell is about to be unleashed on to Norrath by this shadowknight starting with druids!<P>I have a warrior friend now that hooks up with me regular to hunt hill giants in Rathe.  The warrior insists I be there to help taunt off him and whatever healer we have, and fear if our mana's are low and his hitpoints are less than half.  (You should see him scream FEAR FEAR FEAR. Hehe, I am his favorite partner.)<P>I was a full bronze, grobb cleaver wielding SK at level 17.  I had a dwarven axe from level 6 all the way till level 20.  Then got a hold of a silvery axe till level 31.  Now using the Wraithbone hammer and cracked darkwood shield and a Dark Reaver.  This guy is all earned!  No twink available when I started!<P>Now I am watching for darkforge armor to go on sale.<P>All I can say is hang in there.<P>For the rest of the posters, I am already dreading getting to level 50 as I know it will be my retirement level until they correct the errors they made with high level SK's (hybrids).  If you don't believe post 50 play sucks, try and type /who all shadowknight 50 60 and you will find your answer.  I have been doing this often and have yet to find one above level 55.  I generally get a return of 3 names.  Warriors, clerics, enchanters are all too long to list.  Rangers and Paladins in the same boat as us.  I found one ranger at level 60 and it was only because he was a member of an uber guild.<P>What a shame.  The same penalty that was imposed due to our mid level power now kills us in achieving our ultimate goals  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/frown.gif">  I say it is about time they removed all that exp bologne.  It may have made sense to keep everyone from playing a hybrid but now it makes them a very rare class to see under level 20 because of the fact that everyone knows that hybrids are so severely hamstrung up at high level.<P>I am optimistic that something good will eventually happen for the high level hybrids.  I for one will have a lot of fun getting to 50.  By then maybe something will have been corrected.  (My choices would first to lower the exp penalty and then simply let the caps on combat be increased to warrior levels.)  I think Verant will have to do something because SK's and Paly's are going the way of rangers.  Rangers have all but dropped out of existance for new characters and most guilds are losing them because they are slowing down the rest of the guild from achieving their goals.  Rangers had this problem pre-level 50.  Our problem begins shortly after that.<P>Good luck to all my dark brothers and sisters who have embraced the real challenge of EQ!<P>------------------<BR>Daarth Jherrin 33 SK Lanys T'Vyl</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000040&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Hybrids should be less effective the higher in levels you go.<P>Players who choose hybrids are accepting spell casting in place of melee power.<P>*Ever heal yourself after a fight to reduce your downtime?  Warriors can't.<P>*Ever caste Invis or ITU yourself to travel safely or get your corpse?  Warrior's can't.<P>*Ever cast Fear, FD, HT, LoH, or SoW to save your life?  Warriors can't.<P>...you get the idea.  I willingly choose to play a SK over a warrior because I can solo, fear kite, Invis and Feign.  In the name of game balance, those advantages dictate my melee skills must be lower. I agree with that.<P>My point is that the hybrid parent classes tend to increase in power as they level, moreso than hybrids do.  Up to about level 25ish, I could barely tell the difference between the melee damage of a hyrbid and warrior (assuming equivilant gear).  At what level did your group stop /shouting "We need a tank" and start /shouting "We need a warrior"?<P>Look at Cleric and Druid/Shaman healing.  You can survive quite nicely with a druid/shaman healer up to ~34.  After that, Cleric healing starts to become preffered until it's practically required.  Same thing with warriors and hybrids.  At lower levels, either will do as the tank, but at some point, the slightly higher HP and Attack Rating with their noticeably higher AC and damage output make them preffered.  I don't see a problem with this.  It's the price we hybrids pay for our casting ability.<P>I do think that hybrids should get some (not all) of the disciplines post 50, with Rangers getting more offensively oriented ones and Paly's and Sk's getting more defensively oriented ones.

</FONT><HR>I am new to EQ, and Hesster, my lvl 15 Iksar SK is my first character. I've been getting nothing but the equivilent of funny looks and stares of disbelief from everyone else.<P>I chose my character on the basis of coolness, and I really enjoy her. Maybe it's because I don't know any better or have nothing to compare my experience against. I saw the 'very difficult' warning when I created her, but I looked at it as a challenge, and I still do. The idea of a dark paladin appealed to me, and I love reptiles. What could be cooler? <P>Unlike warriors or monks, we can cast spells and get pets. Unlike necros, we can wear heavier armor, have awesome weapons, and beat the crap out of stuff ourselves. Sure I know Iksar can't wear plate like other SKs, but so what? Maybe I'll end up being the only high level Iksar SK on my server, because I intend to stick with her. I like being rare. One can walk into the Field of Bone and can't swing a dead cat without hitting an Iksar monk or necro. <P>I'll admit, I'm only level 15, so maybe I just don't know what it's like past level 30 or 35 or whatever. The point is, I don't care. I like my character for what she is, an Iksar, and a Shadow Knight, IMHO the coolest class in the game. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000042&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

I love my spells, i think there are the best at helping take the target down, unlike otther hybrids that are for less DT and looking pretty (yea woohoo you bell-bottom wearing ranger :-0 )<BR>But im not necessarily looking for less DT even though it would be nice, but sks are designed to worry about making the other guy fall before you do, and may i say they are great at it. very simple reason why they is better than warriors at soloing, Darkness spell, fear, pet, lil debuff, dead.<BR>sometimes fear just aint the way to go cause of the terrain, but when you can fear succsefully, you feel like a caster the most powerful person having bested the simpleton warrior and the frail caster, and besides, your spells dont cost much and yuo wont have to be waiting for your mana to return cause your hp wil take longer.  and also hey FD is arguably the best ability/spell in game im pretty happy about that.<BR>of course theres some flaws with the character, like exp penalty, extreme KOS everywhere and never be as strong as your warrior friend, but when i look and those pretty boy humans and those bell bottom wearing rangers i know i picked the right class.<BR>BTW ogre SK is the only way!<BR>maybe trolls too but too many already<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000045&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Harm touch vs. Loh :  I love my sk, but frankly I have paladin envy.  Loh is SOO much more powerful than harm touch.  I understand that harm touch is offensive and there is a concern that sk's could gang up on mobs they shouldnt be able to kill, but you cannot deny that the once a day hail mary of an sk is pathetic compared to LOH.  I believe a fair compromise would be to make harm touch a life tap.  This would greatly increase its value to the sk, without creating an "ultimate weapon" group of sk's.  I think it would even the playing field for sk's.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000046&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I have to keep reminding myself that opinions and thoughts are really best identified with level reached.  A level 20 SK might be having a blast - a level 50 SK knows the party is over.  Also, choice of race is important.  A human is weaker in a fight up through the levels - then at 49 or 51 if he is REALLY slow to learn, he will peak and the party is over.  Wake up - there are fewer high level SKs every day - we are switching to other characters.  There is NO reward to keep at it.  If you don't know the uber classes by now you are reading the wrong posts.  If you just want to have fun, and you think struggling with an underpowered SK is fun for you - have at it.<BR>Please don't go on and on about how tough you are.  Your not.  My SK is retired at 50 and it was the best thing I ever did.  What you think you know about Sks at low levels is not the Kunark truth - you'll find out.<BR>You all gush about solo and reverse kiting, yet I have a much lower shaman who can do it with far less downtime.

Ever wonder why Veriant themselves say that newbie players shouldn't pick a SK, that it's for patient and experienced players?<P>I know why.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=112&topic=000070.cgi&ReplyNum=000049&forum=General&TopicSubject=Shadow+Knights+just+plain+suck+but+hey+I+play+one+">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum112/HTML/000070-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum112/HTML/000070.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum112/HTML/000070-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum112/HTML/000070-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum112&number=112&thisthread=000070&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum112&number=112&thisthread=000070&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
