</FONT><HR>Goodkarma sat quietly on a hill overlooking the Ocean of Tears.  The wind whispered softly in her ear and, for a moment, she allowed herself to drift back in time to remember the most important moment of her short life as she tried to understand what the wind was telling her.<P>As was tradition, when she came to her 20th circle, family and friends were invited to the family home for the Ceremony.  It had been going on for generations.  Her mother before her, her grandmother, her great grandmother had all done the same thing.  She sat in a darkened room, the wind to whispering to her.  She had recently obtained her 20th circle and had returned home to Freeport for the Ceremony.  She sat quietly and patiently, forming the words she would speak before those assembled in the morning.  There was a soft knock on the door to her room.  "Come in", she said.  The door was flung open with authority by an older woman who used her magician's staff more as a cane, undeniable power still glinting in her eyes.  "My grandchild..I have come to speak with you."  She took the chair across from Goodkarma, settling her staff on her lap.  Of the long line of women in her family, the woman who sat before her was without a doubt the most powerful magician in Goodkarma's family, and also the one who caused the most discord.  With an undeniable sense of self, Goodkarma's grandmother had propelled herself headlong into her studies in her own way, never waivering either in her sense of honor nor in her sense of self.  In her time, Goodkarma's grandmother was known as the most powerful magician in the land.<P>"It has taken you a long time to reach your 20th circle, my child" began the grandmother.  Smiling, Goodkarma looked into the eyes that had fed her sense of self and honor her entire life.  "I know, Grandmother.  I've been busy" Goodkarma  answered.  Sighing her grandmother took Goodkarma's hands in her own.  "I remember my Ceremony."  Goodkarma broke into a huge grin.  Her grandmother's Ceremony was something of a legend.  When she announced that she would be known throughout Norrath as the most powerful magician in the land, there were those there that actually laughed at her.  Those who did not watched her make her way to that standing and hold it for a very long time.  "I expect no less from you.  I have been tolerant of your wanderings, of your less than dedicated efforts to obtain your levels, your complete lack of discipline in the studying of your art, but your father named you well and you have lived up to that name.  I see in you a magician of a different kind.  One that truly understands the hearts of others and works for others first.  But you also have within you a tremendous power that runs through the women of this family.  Within you it is stronger than it has been in any generation in memory.  I ask you to remember this..there will come a time when you have to do something that goes against everything you believe in, everything you have been taught and will call into every fiber of your being, searching for the power that lies just beneath your understanding.  At that moment, and not until that moment, will you know your true inner self."  With that, Goodkarma's grandmother stood and walked out of the room.  Goodkarma sighed.  Again she turned to the window, allowing her thoughts to return to her Ceremony.  She sat there a long time, her grandmother's words ringing in her ears.  "I expect no less from you."  It was quite an expectation.  Although she knew the way she had chosen was different than most, she also knew that it was the only direction she could go.  It was very late when Goodkarma finally allowed herself to drift off to sleep.<P>Those assembled that morning came from all across Norrath.  People of every race, of every class stood together, reliving their adventures with Goodkarma.  Many tales were told that morning waiting for the Ceremony to begin, and much teasing was done as to her foibles.  Never one to hide her faults, Goodkarma always readily admitted she was directionally challenged (the most common phrase heard amongst the crowd was "So what was the longest amount of time it took you to find her once she got lost?") and had a terrible time in dungeons.  These foibles endeared her to her friends and allies, although made her acquaintances undeniably upset and outraged.  Laughs were abundant.  As her grandmother stood among those assembled, listening to the stories of her granddaughter, she was amazed at three things.  First was the vast array of people there.  And yet they all had common ground and had obviously been together on occasions, probably brought together by her granddaughter.  There was no discord, no strife, no arguing.  Just peace and happiness.  The second thing her grandmother noted was the circles obtained by those around her.  She immediately shook her head, dismissing the obvious comparisons she was making between her granddaughter and those around her.  It was useless to try to compare Goodkarma to anyone.  Never one to bend from her values, Goodkarma did things at her own pace, for her own reasons.  To question it, the grandmother knew far too well, was enough to drive a person to the brink of insanity.  Finally, she noted that those that were assembled there were bedecked in the fruits of their travels, obviously proud of their acquisitions.  She thought to her granddaughter and her equipment.  Goodkarma could recite who gave her each of the items she wore with great pride.  It mattered not what it was; if it was a gift, it was invaluable to her and she would not part with it, no matter what else was out there.  There were a few exceptions; a few people from whom she would accept gifts that bettered those that she already wore..but those were few and far between and consisted mainly of her robe and her weapon of choice.<P>At the appointed hour, her father came to Goodkarma's room to bring her to those who waited her.  "I want you to know, I have no idea what you're going to say but I named you and so far, you have exceeded any hope I had." With that he turned, expecting her to follow.  Goodkarma was taken slightly aback.  Could that have been an understanding that no matter what she would say, he would understand or was it simply resignation that he could not for the life of him figure her out.  The time for that answer was drawing near.  She followed her father out of the room, down the hall and outside.  Her father stood in front of those assembled and read the traditional words:<P>"I stand before you with my daughter.  Having obtained her 20th circle, this is her Ceremony.  Standing before her family, her friends and her magician trainers, she will now state her goals for her life and the name by which she will be known from this day on.  We will all bear witness to these words and swear to help her stay the course she has chosen.  As bound as she will be to these words, so are we."<P>With her head held high, her back straight, Goodkarma walked to stand by her father's side and began to recite the words she had formed the night before:<P>"I have traveled extensively throughout Norrath.  I have met many honorable people and made many friends along the way.  Without their help and support, I would not stand before you today.  I want them to know that I am well aware of the fact that I can be trying on one's patience and tend to be a bit off the beaten track when compared to others.  Those who stand here today and those who stand beside me throughout my travels are those that have the patience and tolerance needed to be my friends and allies.  You will forever hold a place in my heart and soul and I will always be there for you.<P>As tradition dictates, I will now pronounce my life goals and the path that I will follow the rest of my days.<P>I have learned of many troubles in the land of Norrath through my limited travels.  Troubles between peoples, between classes, between lands and between individuals.  Wherever I came across these conflicts, I stopped to do my small part to bring about peace.  At that moment, I realized that only then was I whole.  I am fulfilling that which I so much want to do with my life.  Although my magician training is important, nothing is more important than bringing peace to this land of conflict.  I am not, however naive and understand that the powers I have must be used to help promote that peace and tranquility.  It is for that reason alone that I will continue my training as a magician.  By the same token, I swear before you today I will never use my magic for evil or to hurt another.<P>I will affiliate with only those who are as I am - like in mind, soul and spirit.  I will consider all my friend until given ample evidence otherwise.  I will have no sworn enemies, I will take part in no wars and will bring no harm to another.  My life will be dedicated to peace and friendship.  I will choose my true friends carefully and my name shall be synonymous with peace, happiness, serenity and honor.<P>On a personal level, I will listen to the wind, waiting to hear the name of the other half of my soul.  I will continue to listen for the name of he who is my other half, but if the name does not come, I will be at peace.  I do not stand strictly listening to the wind.  If it catches me, if I hear a name, so be it.  If the wind should miss me, or if the name that it whispers does not meet the approval of those I trust, I will still be Goodkarma.  My heart will not change, nor will my soul, and although my soul will never be completely whole, I will harbor no ill will to the wind.  To this time, the wind has only whispered the name of those in need, those in trouble and those who were and are to become my friends.<P>The naming part always comes last.  I have thought long and hard on this issue.  The taking of a surname has become shrouded in useless vanity and pride; a way of saying to all around you "Look at me...I am at least in my 20th circle."  The true meaning of the surname has been lost.  There was a time when the taking of a surname represented the distance which you had come since your birth and how you wished to be judged in the future.  All who looked upon you gleaned who you were from your names.  Since that meaning has been so lost, I will be known for now and for my life as Goodkarma.  As long as I walk this earth alone, I will be called Goodkarma.  The only surname I will ever consider is that of the other half of my soul, should I be lucky enough to find him.  <P>The gasps were audible, and Goodkarma could see her mother weeping.  Her daughter would never be as distinguished as those around her.  Why would she never just travel the path that all others had; why must she always choose a different one?  Goodkarma could see the questions in her mother's eyes.  Her father simply stood there, staring at her, unsure of what his reaction should be.  Goodkarma then glanced at her grandmother.  She stood off to the side of the rest of the group, the smile on her face lighting her eyes to rival the brightest stars.  Goodkarma returned the smile.  The words had become a prophecy "I expect no less of you."<P>Looking back over her Ceremony, Goodkarma realized that she still traveled the path she had chosen all that time ago.  She counted not a single person as an enemy anywhere in the land.  Although she had affiliated herself with the guild known as the Truthseekers, she found them to be as honorable and just as she.  A minor variance, she decided to herself.  Her circles had grown slightly, but was still of secondary importance to those she called her friends.  A small smile crossed Goodkarma's face as she recalled the names of her dearest and closest friends.  Rarely did she enter a place without knowing at least one person in it.  And it was not unusual for her to hear from those at a great distance from her on a regular basis.  Each time, she would stop and talk to them, make sure all was well with them and find out any news before moving on.  She never put her needs or wants above those of others, be they her friends or strangers.  Her name was slowly becoming synonymous with those she encountered as being the mirror of the name her father had given her, which she knew kept her on the path she had chosen at her Ceremony.<P>As her mental wanderings of the comparison to her Ceremony and her life ran their course, Goodkarma was startled back to reality by a resounding bonk on her head.  "There you are...haven't you heard me shouting for you?  I swear, you are the only person I know who can get lost on an island."  Thrakkorzog, her hunting partner and adoptive brother since the day she first left Freeport stood in front of her.  "Sorry, I was deep in thought."  Thrakkorzog shook his head.  "Okay, let's get over to the other island and see those gargoyles I have heard so much about."  "Thrak, would you mind heading a different direction?" Goodkarma asked.  Thrakkorzog shrugged at Goodkarma.  "Makes no difference to me."  "Let's head over to the Karanas" Goodkarma suggested vaguely.  "What exactly are we looking for?" Thrakkorzog asked.  "Not what, whom" Goodkarma answered cryptically.  Thrakkorzog looked quizzically at his old friend, but said nothing.  He knew better.  The wind had been blowing with great strength all day.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=23&topic=000001.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=Stories&TopicSubject=Because+I+was+bored-a+short+story">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>People like you really piss me off. How many people would leave a movie if they didnt like the first 5 minutes of it? Answer me that, because I certainly don't know anyone who would. Entertainment always builds, if you have the excitement in the beginning there is nothing to look forward to. Try looking at the Wheel of Time series, 8 books with 800 pages each on average, think on that.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=23&topic=000001.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=Stories&TopicSubject=Because+I+was+bored-a+short+story">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>MUHAHAHAHAH.<P>You think that dork ever read a book at all? Think again. <P>Wheel of Time got a bit stretched out the last 2 volumes I would say. I much preferred the volumes 2-6. <P>But I guess that Demandred will appear from across the sea soon, or is he Taim? The next book will quite likely end with the Tower united & the taint removed.
