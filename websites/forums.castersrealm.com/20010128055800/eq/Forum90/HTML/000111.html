</FONT><HR>Before anyone reads this post, I want to stress three things… first this is a long post, second I and am just trying to gain more insight, and third it is not meant to be a flame. I am hoping to increase my knowledge base about rangers, so please save your “necros suck, rangers rule” posts. What I am asking for is for my thoughts to be challenged, or for ideas that I have mot considered to be offered. <P>The more I think about the ranger, the more I puzzle about what a Ranger’s benefits actually are. Now that bards have proven themselves to me (in my mind bard’s win for most underrated class), I can see the point of playing any other class out there. I questioned the need for wizards once upon a time as well, for the simple fact that they are not mana efficient. For the same mana a wizard is expending nuking things into oblivion, a cleric could keep two or three tanks healed, and in the long run massively out damaging a wizard. But the wizard’s advantage is speed. There is simply no other class that can inflict more damage in a brief period then a wizard. So the value of a wizard is established. A shaman was also a question mark in my mind. I thought they were a druid, racially handicapped with an incredibly low starting wisdom. In fact that is nothing like the truth. With their DOTs, fear, mana for health, fine array of buffs and melee skills, they become group friendly mini-necros. So bards, wizzies and shammies are in, but there is still this ranger question. <P>My very first character was a ranger, as I wanted to roleplay a ranger in the “Lord of the Rings” style. I had also thought of getting a bow, shooting something, run, shoot it again, run and repeat until dead (longbow kiting?). This proved to be impossible given the game parameters. Archery does not inflict enough damage.  Try to imagine taking down a Kunark creature with longbow kiting. First off it would take you an hour to do (that is if you did not agro everything else in the zone). And arrows are expensive, so that theory was screwed. I found it very difficult to gain a consistent flow of experience from anyplace I tried to hunt. Then I tried a necro and never looked back. <BR> <BR>Which brings me back to my original question, what benefits does a ranger have? Of the melee classes, they deal a lesser amount of damage. Of all of the melee classes, they have the second lowest AC (but monks can deal massive amounts of damage, so they are excused). Druids healing is pale in comparison to clerics, and rangers are a 9 level step down even from that. Same goes for the Ranger’s offensive array of spells. Rangers get SOW at a much higher level. But at this level, what is SOW for? It is used for solo blast kitting (not a strong suit of a ranger) and for pulling (ranger’s cannot feign pull or fully tank at this level, so they are poor pullers). The real group benefit I can see from a ranger is through heavy use of the snare spell, to help avoid a nasty train situation. Also, the combination of dual wield, archery and offensive spells might allow them to act as a peeler, by quickly getting mobs off the casters and healers.<P>I think ranger’s only unique class trait is there critical hit with archery, which is something I question the usefulness of. The ability to track at low levels is also questionable. The true benefit of tracking is for getting quest mobs (I imagine that tracking the Ancient Cyclops in South Ro is gravy). However, quests are really not to worthy until level 24 or so, as the lesser quest items are well… lesser quest items. The only decent low level quests which come to mind that might need tracking are the Bloodforge Hammer and Trueshot Longbow quests.   <P>I am asking for a bit of enlightenment. I can understand a person wanting to role-play a ranger (all true role-players should be praised).  But, on a purely analytical basis, why should a person choose to play a ranger? Are there enough benefits of the class to outweigh the hefty XP penalty? What roles do rangers fill that other characters cannot fill more efficiently (either solo or grouping)?<P>Cheers,<BR>Ancagalon the Black<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>You Truly dont understand most races in Everquest. You chose a necro cause it is the most powerful Soloers in Everquest. Playing a necro has made you beleive that all other classes are underraited. Im a ranger i hunt in groups 24-7 i do solo sometimes but the exp is awful considereing the type of creatures wich i can solo. I usually never have a necro in a group. I sometimes see no reason to have a necro in group. I can deal without necros pretty much anywhere. <BR> The concept of a ranger you are looking for and i will give you a bit of info. You have never played a ranger befor thats easy to tell, and if you have not to a higher end lvl. Rangers are incredible pullers. Harmony is a very low end spell but it can become usefull when theres a croud of mobs and you only want to pull 1. Say if you in a dungeon like zone theres a way where you can pull 1 or 2 mobs and the rest wont agro. Biggest normal pull ive ever seen was 3 thats it 3. Single and double pulls are normal pulls mostly. You pull 2 you can croud control by root. You should get the creature atleast down to 1/4th of its life or dead befor the root wears off. Our archery is a bit flawed we can crit hit every once in a while but its not good enough to create considerable dmg. Bows are used mostly for pulling. You can do a snare pull and hit it with the bow 3 or 4 times before it reaches you and starts to attack you and your group. Only works well in some zones though. How can you say rangers do less dmg then all other melee classes? I do more dmg then Paladins,SK's,Warriors (yes i do more dmg then a warrior) and a rogue if he isnt backstabbing the creature. Rangers have very quik weaponry, we now have better weapons then most warriors have. Our dmg spells are fast and pack a small punch. when your warrior just hit 4 times for 25 or so i just let off a 250dd. Pluss the melee dmg we create before and after casting that spell. I may now tank very well but i can tank non the less. A good ranger has to use all the abilities given to him or else there going to be no good. You either play a ranger good or you dont know how to play a ranger, thats how it is. You have to know everything thats going on around you or you will fail on being a good ranger. I do use tuant often, if it gets on the cleric,enc,wizzie i tuant even sometimes i will tuant off of the warrior cause hes running low on heal and the Cheal is still being casted.<BR> Rangers can do a lot, just many people who play rangers play too much like a warrior or a druid.<P>Capri Sun<BR>Nameless<BR>Sanctuary</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>"You chose a necro cause it is the most powerful Soloers in Everquest." You are absolutely right, that is why I choose to play a necro. I also play an enchanter and a monk, but due to my work schedule, I find it hard to find groups of people to adventure with, so my main class needs to be able to work alone. "Playing a necro has made you believe that all other classes are underrated." This is not the case. I have taken the time to learn about each class out there, and have a good handle on most classes even if I do not actually play them. I understand a necro is designed to solo and not to group. I understand that my enchanter is for crowd control in a group and is limited her soloing ability. What I was getting at is every class out there tends to do certain things better than other classes. With a ranger I was coming up kind of empty as to what they did better than other classes. That is what I am asking for. What can a ranger do that other classes cannot? Pulling with root / harmony is a powerful concept (those are the kinds of things I was after). Also, I was unaware that rangers out damage Paladins and their dark counterparts, so I am glad to learn about that. What else can rangers do? Is there a "class defining" strategy that good rangers always use?<P><BR>Cheers,<BR>Ancagalon the Black<P>PS if I could rewrite the first post, I would have avoided mentioning necros at all. I am really not looking to turn this into a necro vs. ranger post; I really just want to hear about the strengths of playing a ranger.<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Ancagalon (edited November 22, 2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I find it strange to see a Necro interested in anything other then themselves, but it is good to see that you seem to have a desire to learn (you might be salvageable). Though I am still struggling to get my Ranger to level 40, he is my main character. I am lucky to have several higher-level friends who also play Rangers as well as a strong guild to back me up. When I started EQ, my first character was a Ranger, as I too wanted to be like Aragorn (SP) from Lord of the Rings. Well, the anti-social wandering type is simply not the way to play a Ranger. Rangers need to group in order to advance. <P>A lot of the time when I am grouped, I become the puller. Root or Harmony to break spawns. Some damage spells or archery to soften them up and then a run at SOW speed back to the group. I wait until after the main tanks agro the creature and then I SNARE everything, to prevent runners. In most groups I also take it upon myself to keep a close eye on the casters, and if they get a MOB on them, I can quickly get the MOB off. With the fast weapon array, spicing of DD spells and high amounts of damage I can do per round, I usually do not even need to mash my taunt button. <P>I have seen many rangers in my travels, both good and bad, and all I can say is the ones that were played bad either tried to be a Warrior or a Druid. If you want to play like a Warrior, create a Warrior (same with a Druid). Rangers must be played like a Rangers with the ideas provided above. As to a “class specific” strategy that you are after I am not sure there is one for a Ranger. I would assume you are talking about Druids (best at snare kiting), Warriors (best at tanking), Enchanters (best at Mez crowd control) and of course the Necro (best at fear kiting). I am not sure that Rangers have one of these, but if played well, can perform a variety of roles. Pulling / peeling / tanking (only if there are no Warriors). I think we fall more under the category of Mages, Shadow Knights, Paladins and Bards. Jack-of-all-trades.<P>As an aside, if you decide to dust off your Ranger I would suggest four very important items, most of which are stated in other threads. First AC is everything to a Ranger. This stat is as vital to a Ranger than Intelligence is to your Necromancer. Second, Ranger weapon selection should always focus on speed more than damage. Third, play as a Ranger (as stated you are no Warrior or Druid), and fourth, get a guild or a group of friends who know what a Ranger can do, that way you will have a better chance at CONSISTENTLY finding a group. I have found several times that people are not as willing to group with a Ranger as they are with a Warrior, Cleric, Enchanter or Monk. <P>I hope this helps.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Rangers dont Really do anything better then any other class. What hybrids were made to do was to be able to do things 2 different classes cant do the same of. While a warrior cant nuke and harmony, a druid cant tank at all. WHile a druid can heal a warrior cannot heal at all. We were made to be able to do a large array of things just not to the point where we would be able to tank better then the tanks and nuke and heal better then the casting types. Kinda like the best of bolth worlds but not really the best or else we would be overpowered.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Ancagalon<P>Here is a brief list of ranger strengths and weaknesses, I'll let you make up your own mind.<P>Strengths<P>Damage: Rangers are the 3rd best melee damage dealers in the game. With the exception of monks, rogues, and warriors, no other melee classes can come close to a ranger in damage. (and with spells we are slightly ahead of warriors) We also out damage ALL the other melee classes when doing damage from a range. This means that if we are forced to back off from combat for whatever reason, we can still contribute.<P>Taunting: Very few classes can taunt as well as a ranger can. My motto when playing my ranger is that I can taunt anything off of anyone, and believe me, those wizzies and enchanters really appreciate it.<P>Snare: Saves mana for the druids. Always nice.<P>Other spells: While many of them are overridden by the druid line (and the new velious spells suck), there is always something that we can contribute. Be it capping off higher level heals, rooting for crowd control, or throwing on a damage shield or buff.<P>Pulling: we are also one of the best pullers in the game. Using our harmony/root and zone technique, we can pull almost as well as a character with feign death. Even if the mob's are clumped.<P>Track: Rangers can track far better than any other class in the game. This is invaluable, especially in outdoor zones looking for that random location spawn. Or in dungeons so you can tell when so-and-so pops and adjust your actions accordingly.<P>Weaknesses<P>Low ac and hp: A tanking ranger is a dead ranger, especially at higher lvls. We did get a nice bonus to our parry and dodge caps which makes us much more survivable, but we still just don't tank well.<P>High aggro: Thanks to our high damage output and annoying spells like snare, we are never far from the top of the aggro list, and taunting off us can be a problem. This, combined with our low ac and hp, can give clerics a real headache keeping us in the game. We can back off from direct combat, however, and still play a role with our strong distance damage. High aggro can also be a good thing as well.(see above)<P>Spells: as previously stated, many of our spells are overridden by druids.<P>Stigma: There is a negative stigma attached to the name "ranger". Whether it is true or not, it is a disadvantage when trying to get groups.<P>I will let you make your own decision, but I firmly believe that a well played ranger can make an invaluable addition to any group, and that our strengths far outweigh our weaknesses. I hope that you will come to the same conclusion.<P>P.S. Let me know what you think with a reply, won't you?<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think that the above posts have given me a good understanding of what Rangers are about. It does sound like a challanging class to play, so my hats off (or runed circlets off) to the skillfull rangers out there.<P>To recap, it sounds as if ragners are very effective pullers using a combination of spells, archery and high damage output. Rangers also contribute by effectively getting creatures off of the casters in short order. It sounds as if your spells can save mana for the druids and clerics of the group (but this is limited by your lower spell level). "Kinda like the best of both worlds but not really the best or else we would be overpowered." Makes sense to me.<P>It also sounds that a poorly played ranger can become a mana sink for a cleric, if they try to play like a warrior (lower AC, lower hit points and high aggro factor). So rangers should always remember that they are rangers. <P>I think I have the answers I was searching for. Much thanks to Capri, the wood elf guy and Ytoob.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>There's one thing I didnt see in the above posts. I have always seen the ranger as a secondary tank, and a utility class.<P>Why secondary? Because we can't take the beating the way our plate wearing brothers and sisters can. We do dish out some good damage, so if there is a main tank that can keep the mob on him/herself, then our melee output is good.<BR>But, another strength of the ranger, is the way we can taunt. If a mob decides to go after our cleric, the main tank can keep his target, and I (the ranger) can go after the renegade mob, and taunt it very quickly (dual wield, double attack, snare and a dot taunts most mobs. Then comes taunt skill).<P>And then we make some ok pullers (harmony, root and self-sow). Yes druids can do this, but they are even worse at taking a beating. And you dont stop to heal with 3 mobs on your tail ;-)<P>Just my thoughts.<P>-Gaspode, 42 ranger, the Rathe</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Bow kiting is good until after 20. But after than yes the bow is pointless to me. Rangers are a great class. We are versatile. No we are not the most powerful but only one class can be. And by no means are we the weakest. So a warrior can take the damage but deals only a medium amount. What else can he do? Heal himself after battle? No. Good puller ? Not really. Buff anybody with anything? No. Snare? No. Root park? No. Ok what can a Paladin do? Deal as much damage as a Ranger? LMAO! Heck no! Heal himself? Yes. Good Puller? Not really. Nice buffs? Yes. On and on and on. I am not putting down any class but pointing out the areas rangers are better in. Your only looking at the fight aspect of the game. Your not looking pre-fight and post-fight and also traveling. Rangers will always outdamage a SK or Paladin big time. At 39th lvl I can solo low blues. I don't because being in a group is a lot better. Your looking at the issue with a blind eye. No we don't have mana boosting abilities. I think thats the only reason you even like a bard. To help you. And being a necro as you are you should know how useful snare/fear is and then send your pet and ranger in to kill the mob. And in Kunark I did solo a blue with Bow-Kiting and nuking in a safe area, so in Kunark its possible. Quit being so blind and have an open-mind.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>The point to having a ranger around?  Hmmm...<P>Well, the first point is that rangers are not a solo class.  Not past about 20th.  So the question is, what do we contribute in a group?<P>Rangers are good pullers, for a couple reasons -- we get harmony, which lets us break up clumped spawns.  Any ranger who knows his class should almost never come back with an uncontrollable pull, which is more than I can say for most warriors/pallys/SK's.  By pulling with either arrows or damage spells we can get the mob back to the group without taking much, if any, damage.  Even at low levels, with no SoW, a ranger can get pull a mob and get back to the group at full health by pulling with a snare.  Our DD's aren't much, but they're enough to soften the critter up some, and make sure it doesn't get lost on a long pull.<P>If a pull does get out of hand, or some wandering monster decides to pile in on the fight, we can root-park it -- other classes can do this too, but it saves mana for the casters and lets them concentrate on the fight at hand.<P>We save healers mana -- by healing up after a fight, that's one or two heals less that the cleric has to use.<P>We can pull mobs off casters like nothing else in the game.  As a ranger, I can control where the monster turns his attention -- pull it off the casters, and as necessary root it, back out and let a real tank take the abuse for a while.  And even once I do that, I can still contribute some decent damage by shooting and casting.  (The thing I miss most when I go play my monk is that kind of control -- the only think she can do is beat on the mob until it turns on her, and that's not always fast enough to save someone.)<P>We can serve as a backup tank -- I may not tank as well as a warrior, but taunting the mob onto me for a few rounds may well save his life.  I can, in a pinch, even serve as primary tank, with a good cleric and preferably a shaman as well standing behind me (the difference the shaman slow spells make in the damage done to tanks is amazing, but that's a whole different topic).<P>We're better at dealing out damage than taking it, really -- monks and rogues do more damage, but I can easily outdamage a pally or SK of my level, and maybe a warrior as well.  We get a lot of very fast weapons which can really pile on the damage.<P>With a good ranger in the group, you should never see a mob run.  They'll try, but by that time they should be snared and not going anywhere.  Alternatively, if things go really, really bad, a snare or a root will give the group that much more time to run.<P>And the last thing...track.  If you want to find a rare spawn, get yourself a ranger.  Track isn't perfect, especially in crowded areas, and it occasionally gets really confused when you're trying to find other players, but it's a whole lot better than wandering around for a couple hours trying to spot that named whatever.  This also goes back to the pulling thing -- I can go out and pick and choose from the available mobs a lot easier than anyone else.<P>I guess the point of all this is that rangers do a lot of things that other classes do better.  I often see my role in a group as taking some of the load off the other players -- healing after the fight to save the cleric's mana, snaring so the druid doesn't have to worry about it, sharing out the damage so the tank doesn't die.  I also play my ranger differently depending on what the group looks like and what it needs most at that moment.<P>I have a lot of fun playing my ranger -- I get to run around pulling, I'm right in the middle of every fight, I scout new places and find new and interesting monsters...and I love all of it!</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000010&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>You really shouldn't be looking at Rangers if you're looking for a weak class. Paladins are one of the weakest classes of all in EQ. They have their abilitys (I do infact play a Paladin, he is currently lvl34) like healing and such. I often play the back up healer, or even main healer when we don't have a cleric, druid or shammy around. But I often question my usefulness as a Paladin. I can't do crap for melee damage, I have no offencive spells (Not counting, stun and that expulse undead stuff) to speak of really. I really never see myself as an asset to a group. What a Pally can do, a Warrior or Cleric can do 8x better. But, Pallys a very fun to play and I think have some of the coolest weapons in the game. I also have a Ranger, whom is lvl18 right now. <P>I don't know exactly what I'm doing posting this stuff on the Ranger board, but I guess I'm trying to figure out what people think of us Pallys... as in are we useful, or pure crap?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Pallies are the same thing as all hybrid classes. Pallies are second best tanks, and can heal very well. You can also do whats called as free heals wich helps a lot cause it doesnt waste any mana. Chain stunning is also very good dureing fights.<BR> Now i dont know a lot about paladins but there just like rangers but instead of being half warrior half druid there half warrior half cleric. And theres also LoH so that you or one of your group members are close to dieing you can save there lives quikly. A lotta people would choose a paladin over a ranger, cause they can atleast take some devent ammount of dmg.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000013&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>At the risk of wandering completely off-topic...<P>By somewhere in the 30's (I could go look at spell lists and figure it out exactly, but I'm lazy), paladins are casting the same healing spell as shaman and druids (greater heal).  As of the hybrid mana patch a while back, a paladin has nearly as much mana as a shaman or druid of the same level, maybe more than a shaman (since shaman tend to have a relatively low WIS).  In my book, that means that a pally is about as effective as a healer as a shaman or druid, and has better melee capabilities...<P>So yeah, I'd say a pally is a pretty useful group member.  They also have some pretty nice situational uses -- I spent a number of levels in my low-20's sitting on an undead camp with my ranger and my friend's pally; we raised pull/snare/fear/ward undead to an art form.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000014&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Paladins dont have the same ammount of mana as a shaman and druid. Only time a shaman would have low wis is if he was a really low lvl or was completly unlucky or not smart enough to get his shaman armour. Also shamans can canablize for more mana. Druids get regen,chloro,regrowth so they wont have to cast heal so much. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000015&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Just an example where a ranger can be useful:<P>Let's say that as a necro you are soloing in Skyfire Mountains.  Your poor pathetic ranger friend shows up and you decide to show pity on him and let him group with you.  You sit and med while the ranger goes and pulls a mob.  You fear it, out your pet on it... the same stuff you always have done, only this time you have a ranger there too.<P>Now, sooner or later, you pull a summoning mob.  This mob summons you, the necro, and you can't get a spell off.  The ranger peels it off you and saves your hide.  The ranger takes some damage sure, but you probably would have ended up dead.  No one can out taunt a ranger if he/she wants the mobs attention, and the ranger simply cast a few heals when it was over and went out after the next mob.<P>You continue on, noticing that since the ranger has track, you can be selective about what you hunt and still have mobs as often as you want them, which is pretty often. <P>During one fight, a wanderer comes by and suddenly you have 2 mobs.   The ranger roots one while you fight the other.  What should have been hard was no big deal.<P>=========<P>Rangers can be useful to have around in many ways.  There is not set rules that a ranger has, things to do that are always right.  Everything is situational.  What works grouped with certain classes fighting certain mobs isn't right for other times and places.  There are times when a ranger may not seem to add anything to a group, but one thing that is always there is more options if things go terribly wrong, whether those options are being used at the moment or not. <P>Don't underestimate a ranger, or any hybrid for that matter.  If they know what they are doing, they can save the entire group when things don't go by the script.  Where we shine is doing things no "one" else can do.  <P>Perhaps the single biggest detriment to rangers and hybrids in general is everyones "knowledge" of how things should be done.  Everyone knows what classes are needed and what roles are to be filled.  That has pigeon-holed hybrids to some extent into being "backup" this or that.  <P>Where I have most fun as a ranger are in groups that would typically be considered unbalanced.  In those groups, there are no rules and you get to have fun with the abilities you have. As a matter of fact, I once was the healer of a group of 3 shadow knights and a necro in lower guk.   Now THAT was exciting.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>My main is a Ranger.  He is 48 struggling to reach 49.  Yes, leveling has become quite difficult.  I found i could solo stuff in a pinch into the low 40s for exp.  But no longer.  Yes, it has become difficult to find groups; but that is as much a higher level problem as it is a class one.<P>I still love my ranger.  As others have said, it is all knowing how to play most effectively in a given group or situation.  I have been in groups with 3 rangers and a cleric that could just rock.  We do lots of damage and keep taunting off each other.  I also regularly play with a druid and 3 wizzies.  At first when I did this I felt like extra baggage.  And yes they could easily play without me.  But with me i can help control the mob.  I can taunt a mob off of a wizzie that just Ice cometed it.  So in effect I keep the mob in the center while they nuke it much quicker than they would other wise.  <P>Oh btw, I am sorry to say that I find archery next to useless anymore.  If I happen to have arrows I use it some, but it is so unaffective that I usually forget to buy stuff and make them.  It was useful to the mid 30s.  I could bow kite something down to half health then engage it.  But when I saw that I was at almost 200 in archery skill and I still miss 50% of the time, and for less than 20 50% of the hits, I decided it wasn't useful.<BR>Sure occassional crits for 60 happen, but not to be counted on.  Oh and I to tried to make arrows and bows to sell in my early days.  Don't bother.  I always had trouble selling the bows for what they cost.  Make the arrows you want to use but thats about it.<P>Rangers have alot of good points, and can be fun to play.  They have bad points too.  But really all the classes do.  Everything depends on how you like to play.  Every case can be as useful or as useless to a group as they want based on what kind of player you are.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000018&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>As a ranger I have out meleed on a few occasions, Warriors, Monks, and once an entire group in Burning Woods on one of those named wurms. I have played every class aside from Shammy. Ranger has been the most fun so far. Lvling can be slow  unless you know where to go. Now that SoV is out, I am not liking getting spanked by greenies, I mean even the forest giants in FM can't take more than a bub off me. And here this snow bunny is whacking me for 70 something a pop. All that aside though, I am still having a blast playing a ranger. I don't think anyone can just jump in and lvl a ranger past say 35. Ppl give up. and the class becomes the best at 39, you also have to know how to use your strengths, and weaknesses to your advantage.<BR>I never got why people whinned about well rangers have this prob or that prob. Deal with it. Use it to your advantage. That is the challenge, and that is what makes it fun. If it were simple and I could just solo anything I choose, that would get really old, really fast.

</FONT><HR>There are other things that are not being considered here by many of the rangers. I agree with the post from the 48 level ranger. The difference between a level 30 and a level 45 ranger is like night and day. Then add to that the race issue, wood elfs have a high natural agi, so they are often more effective in low level combat. The most important years of the ranger are the first years, his tracking skill is valuable and because of it he is often considered the puller for the group because he can find things quickly in large zones. When he enteres his teens now the groups become more into moving to a close location where the pulls are  simple to find and his tracking skills are not really needed but his warrior skills and snare are. Because at this level the heal for the clerics the druids and the shamen is a mana eating monster and wasting mana on a snare is just not advisable. When the ranger moves into Oasis there is competition for evey kill. Only his tracking ability can keep the exp comming in, by finding the correct pulls back to his group. So again his tracking skill has made him valuable. <BR>Now we enter enter the world of the 20's, a time of confusion for the ranger, Where  to hunt? What zones will be best, Mistmore, Unrest now he must change his playing style, no longer will he be able to stand toe to toe with the warrior, now he must use his wits, Harmony, flame lick and snare, archery, and time to begain his questing. Now he again uses his spells to help the group by improving the odds of safe pulls. But he is learning more and more that the warrior ways are not as effective as they were. Late 20' early 30' becomes more druid than warrior,to solo. He still offers the track skill to the group, Harmony is now a byword, and swarm with flame lick is a usable dot for effectivness. The bow will allow a short break in the fighting process, but he must now learn the pentaly for dying. By 35 all he can think of is the level 39 ahead, the quest of his level send him into the most dangerous zones to fight alone for he will not get others to spend the days with him needed to complete the quest. <BR>And so now he must learn a new way to fight. Because now a death results in seven hours of solo exp recovery. The weapons that do not proc additional damage or give extra wis , stg or agi have little value at these levels. The ranger blade of ebony become very valuable to a solo ranger one root at the right time often means life or death. <BR>We finialy reach 39, joy we get sow. But the best spell of the level is really careless lighting. Now we can nuke. We again give value to a group as now we deal more damage and by using the careless lighting spell we can save the druids mana for heals or evacs. <BR>Now the frustration starts setting in, how can we quest are quest if we have to go into areas no one wants to go into. And the ranger sorry  were full, we have no room , were waiting on and enchater starts. Grouping and playing the game means two different things, It is not always possible to find a group. Many have had bad experences with rangers, auto looting, kill stealing, pull stealing, whining, double pulling, the list goes on and on.. Money is important to a ranger the cost of increasing fletching skill is extream, and spending 1 plat an arrow to make magic damage arrows which at damage 8 hit for crits of 51 show why a ranger is normally poor. <BR>Then we are told the class is not performing as it is suspose to, so the help by increasing us a little bit only to turn around and nerf our weapons that are below 28 delay. Then gives us epic weapons  which have a low damage level and are at a delay which makes them nerfed. <BR>I promise we are a balanced class, if you consider we offer a little of everything, but a lot of nothing. We should be the sixth man of any group , for the one rare spawn that shows,(tracking) for being able to cast sow(after 39)and save druids mana (heals,harmony nuke), to be able to act as a tank when no others are around(melee). There are many points which I disagree on, Rangers are not great taunters, our skill is lower than a pallys, and not half of warriors. The class will be out damaged by pallys remember stun and LOH, gives them advantages as does blinding by light. The only skill that rangers get that reaches full 250 skill level is archery, which as any high level ranger knows is little more than hitting a giant with a spit ball. <BR>Our value to a group is we fit into many openings for support, but because we are balanced to the verant idea we offer no special values </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000021&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR> Im sorry but we can outdmg pallies easily and out taunt them. Rangers are the best tautnters. We are not warriors cause warriors take dmg, rangers cant take much dmg. We do dmg, we do snare, we do tuant, we do pull. Rangers can do a lot but there not "masters" of everything wich they do. Our bow has become better cause of our new discipline. Druids rarely use harmony cause to harmony they have to go where the mobs are and thats where the pullers go. A druid is no puller. Druids can also track. they can track just as good as we can at higher lvls. Unless your trying to track all the way across Dreadlands, a druid can track jsut as well. Im not sure what bow this 41 human ranger is useing but most people will crit for a bit more then 51. I crit for about 70 with normal arrows. Careless lightning doesnt save the druid any mana it only does 99 points of dmg careless lightning is used to bring a larger amount of dmg on the creature in a shorter ammount of time. Our epic weapons are very good. The weapons werent made to go fast, they were made to do more dmg then the normal 1hs that we use. Thats what are procs are for. A 55% haste wich stacks with item haste,enc or shaman haste will make up for the longer delay on our epic quest items. You also can only have so much haste. ever since kunark i think they changed the haste to 110% haste. now a High lvl ranger is supposed to have this weapon so lets say a enchanter comes up and gives you AQ wich is 55% haste and you have your PoA belt wich is 18% haste. right there thats 73% haste. Your weapon proccing would bring it past max haste. then you have your other proc wich is a 55% slow spell. Wich also stacks with shaman malo. That will make the creature slow down a very very large ammount. only bad thing is our slow proc is easily resistable.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000022&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>What can rangers do? Rangers can lvl my lazy ass wizard faster then any other single class. <P>I notice many of these posts refer to rangers usefullness in full groups or solo. How often in fantasy settings do you see rangers in large groups?<P>As a wizard my greatest weakness is my inability to take a beating even though i'm VERY capable of getting the aggro, also not being able to heal myself after getting that beating. My strength is the high damage at a fast pace and my ability to travel long distances. This compliments you rangers very well, allow a wizard, ranger PAIR (thats 2, 1 of each :P) to go all ver Norath looking for a nice spot to hunt, then setting camp for great, 2 way split xp. <P>Ranger harmony pulls (indoors they just have to pull more carfull, but you learn that easy enough with practice[evacs help with the practice]) and keep the aggro as high as possable, and i chain cast my stuns and my baby nuke (currently at lvl 40 its my lvl 24 nuke dam is just under half my big nuke) I can chain it and very rarely get aggroed. You ranger then heal up the little bit of damage you took in that short fight, med as needed and pull before i start bit**ing that your too slow. <P>I did this kind of thing from 25-29 at icy orcs in everfrost, and again occasionally in sol A, king room hallway at 33-37 (ranger was 38-40), and currently at the sarnak towers in OT and FM. We are made for each other.<P>PS: from my personal experience (and i have a lot with both rangers and aggroing [new spells lvls are hard to learn]) rangers are by far the best taunters.<P>------------------<BR>Tatrianna Highblood<BR>40th Trial wizardess<BR>Flame of Honour<BR>Brell</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000023&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>At higher lvls pretty much everyone makes a full group of 6. Theres even times where  2 groups of 6 will hunt in the same spot and still get good exp. Only classes that form small groups are usually necros and druids. Necros just solo and druids can duel kite with other classes.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=90&topic=000111.cgi&ReplyNum=000024&forum=General&TopicSubject=Please+Enlighten+My+Knowledge+of+Rangers">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum90/HTML/000111-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum90/HTML/000111-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum90&number=90&thisthread=000111&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum90&number=90&thisthread=000111&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
