</FONT><HR>Once again, bards are affected more than other classes by a nerf.  Of all the meleeing classes, only bards can haste themselves.  Now our pathetic little speed enhancement spells will truly be pathetic even with a haste item.<P>Enchanters will have to burn more mana than ever and will not have enough to both mez and haste people.  Too bad bards mez spells do not work, don't look to us to pull up the slack.  Oh and our haste spells are now far worse than those of enchanters so expect to get all the haste duties enchanters.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001824.cgi&ReplyNum=000050&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Haste+Changes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Try to think in terms of time.  Short answer is nerf in next few weeks?  Yes.  Overall nerf?  No.<P>This adds more choices of items and spells beyond the single seemingly all-powerful, perma-camped FBSS.  People can still get to haste cap but with better items.  There is going to be an adjustment phase when people will be seeking CoF and other haste items.  This is much like the Rubi armor being changed to class specific quests.  It is a temporary nerf.<P>I would love to see the real number of people, and the percent damage output this is going to change.<P>I expect twinks will feel this more than others.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001824.cgi&ReplyNum=000051&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Haste+Changes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>To recap for those still confused. They are nerfing the "feature" where a haste equipment (hangman's noose, runebrandt girdle, flowing black silk sash, etc) would stack with a haste spell (augment, augmentation, quickness, swift like the wind, etc) to raise the haste cap of the person with both the equipment and the spell casted on them to the maximum haste cap regardless of whether they were below or above level 50.<P>haste item + haste spell = max haste<P>It is now being changed I assume to haste equipment stacking additively to the haste spell to produce the amount of haste being applied to the person being casted on.<P>haste item + haste spell = added total haste<P>I think this is a bad move on the part of Verant. As many have stated this "feature" has been a part of the game so long it's not even funny. To say this is not a nerf to haste casting classes is funny. Before I hit level 51 (very recent) I would go in some dungeons and the pulls would be so fast that just doing crowd control and buffing I was running at a very very low rate of mana and sometimes oom while there were 2 or 3 mobs still to kill. This was using augmentation and not slw (swift like the wind). Now that I have to use slw or something better all the time it's gonna really really drain my mana. <BR>Bate stated that the higher level haste spells will actually do something now and that's true but you never heard any enchanters complain. They were still useful for casting on pets. But to suggest that the way it worked prepatch nerfed enchanters? That's a load of bull. EVERY enchanter loved the way it worked and EVERY bard loved the way it worked even more since bards do melee and singing a spell with an fbss or other haste item raised their underpowered backsides tremendously. Anyone who has reached level 45+ will know this is a MAJOR nerf to all classes that benefited from this. <P>My one teeny tiny hope in all of this is that they will at least give us a small bonus of perhaps 5% or so if both a haste item and spell are present on the one being casted on. This shouldn't be too hard to program in and would at least benefit those with both spell and item present on them. I highly doubt they will change it back to the way it was prepatch.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001824.cgi&ReplyNum=000054&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Haste+Changes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I got halfway through the second pae when I had to stop..I can't take it anymore.<P>Anyone here that think this is an item nerf raise your hand.<P><BR>Look around you...now look at your arm..everyone with thier arm up is an idiot.<P>This is a spell nerf.  The item has not changed at all. A Sk with a FBSS fighting specs will not see a even minor change.<P>The difference was only when you had an FBSS AND a haste spell cast on you. SK's don't cast haste spells. Therefore if you were soloing with your FBSS nothing freaking changed for you.<P>Now ALL people who have haste spells CAST on them had thier speed reduced. That is the change. This puts haste back in the hands of enchanters. Bards and shaman will do in a pich but nowhere near as good.<P>Do enchanters like that? NOPE. We were doing 30 min haste with 90 mana or so since level 29 that far surpassed our level 57 or so wonderous rapidity spell. I mean less mana, lasts longer, adds agi, ac, stamina regen....<P>Now I spend like 8x the mana for half the spell....we are not happy either.<P>Let's put this in differnt terms.<P>Wizard - your nuke now does less dmg and costs way mroe mana...happy?<P>Warrior - You swords delay was increased by 10, your dmg was reduced by 5. Happy?<P>Is it in perspective now?<P>It was a haste SPELL nerf. Noone likes it...NOONE. Not even the ones it benefits the most...because it still massively nerfs their mana pool and the effectiveness, yes it makes them more desirable...but at the same time less desirable.<P>It's hard to explain. The nerf hits us hard...but if we switch spells we take half the hit (just more mana for less effect) bards and shaman can't haste at all no matter how much mana they use compared to us now...but still we were also nerfed. <P>However it makes sense...I just wish they would have fixed it like a year ago when it was submitted as a bug and posted all over the place.<P>Now I think balance issues are present. I think bards need a minor tweak. Shaman are OK. Enchanters are I guess OK.<P>But as a whole we are much weaker vs the enviroment now. I mean I used all that extra mana for nuking, the stamina regen saved the cleric from casting invigor so he could heal more and the agi/ac from aug meant the cleric had to heal less.<P>Now my guess is a cleric, enchanter, tank group (my normal group). In 30 mins they will do about 1,000 less dmg at level 50 then they used to due to all those mana sucks.<P>At level 29 the same group if the warrior happened to have a haste (haha twinks were hit HARD) the tank will swing much much slower. Probably 1,000dmg here too...only here 1,000 dmg is way more of a difference. of course he shouldn't have a haste belt so forget him LOL.<P>My tanks will still hit the cap in most cases. I have the level 52 anayaa's quickening. I am about to scribe augment part 2....it will be a real weird thing to debate which one to cast. I mean like save 300 mana...40ac..staminia regen...or swing 20% faster...hmmmm...It will always be aug on raids still due to mana consumption problems. But this means every tank on the raid swings 50% slower with the haste (if it is the first aug) on a dragon run that is a MAJOR difference when 15 tanks swing at 1.5x speed as oppossed to 2x speed. You'll need another 4 whole tanks or so (or you can probably get away with one more enchanter that casts haste spells, but what a boring role..."here you...haste us before the fight then go sit in the corner and med").</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001824.cgi&ReplyNum=000055&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Haste+Changes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I never even knew statistics for augment vs. the alacrity series though I knew alacrity was supposed to be a faster spell.  I thought most people preferred augmentation becuase of the stamina increase.  I always preferred casting augment myself because it would give both speed and stamina and it timed nicely with casing clarity on the casters in a group.   So now I have to possibly waste another spell slot on keeping invigor up again since without the stamina buff augment will be basically slowing tanks down more than they're used to?  And mobs were nerfed how in return??</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001824.cgi&ReplyNum=000056&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Haste+Changes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>THANK YOU SHARA!!<P>Your comparison of the 2 cases in point was very enlightening. Further, you were courageous enough put the blame on those responsible, VI. I recall over a year ago a player tried to rally others into forcing VI to live up to their promise concerning "packing" the servers. On Tunare any way, they have not. I guess the fact  that EQ went from zero monthly revenue to ~$3,000,000.00 in less than 2 years has lead them to believe they can continue riding roughshod over their customer base,( Wulff drops to his knees in earnest prayer, hoping the day will come when VI not only wakes up to smell the coffee but has it splashed in their faces).</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001824.cgi&ReplyNum=000059&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Haste+Changes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Verant, do us and yourselves a favor.<P>LEAVE THE GAME ALONE.<P>If there is some patch that fixes pathing, corrects a newly (less than couple weeks) discovered bug, adds some features then fine patch it.  I'm sorry no one buys the fact you just "found" this bug.  It has been in EQ sooooo long many forgot it was called a "bug" in the first place.  Now you are "fixing" it.  Why?  Instead of your vague, non-sensical answers how about an answer?  Why was this "bug" ignored for so long and only NOW is suddenly a problem?  Do you actually test a fix before you impliment it??  Do you actually think this will in any way change camping of the FBSS?  Do you not see that the "fix" makes chanters and shammys less effective to the point they have to cast more (using more mana) to get the same results?  <P>What one of the above posters said is correct.  If a wizard spell did less dmg but cost more mana it would be obvious.  If a warrriors weapon had less attack and more delay this would be obvious.  This is nerfing chanters and shammys in the same way, however "haste" isn't something that is readily seen except over time.<P>I suppose we just have to deal with it.  They are so out of touch with their own game, they can't see past the code.  I just always wonder where, when, and how they "test" these things before they change them.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001824.cgi&ReplyNum=000060&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Haste+Changes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Citra:<BR>I am an enchanter, presently 43 but very familiar with the arsenal and tactics of higher level enchanters.<P>I am disagreeing with your assumption that everyone is unhappy with this bug fix.<P>I have been looking forward to this fix for a long long time.<P>Does it impact me negatively?  Yes, on that I agree.<P>Does this make me unhappy?  Not really, it is a bug, a bug that invalidated one of the lines of spells that a lot of work was put into, and was supposed to be in the realm of responsibility of an enchanter.<P>To those of you that complain that this just makes an enchanter even more necessary in higher level dungeons:<BR>Live with it, for the most part they are REQUIRED in high level Kunark dungeons, this change does not suddenly make them more required.<P>To those of you that think a bard or shaman is suddenly less effect:<BR>This is a very minor facet of what defines shaman's and bard's.  That is like saying that if slow was nerfed enchanters would suddenly be useless.  Are they affected, yes they are, but not nearly as much you would have us believe (I also play a 51 shaman, so I am not unknowledgable in the subject).<P>To those of you that claim that the planes suddenly need more people to do I have the following arguement:<BR>The planes (Hate & Fear) were balanced based upon a group of 46-50th level characters with a haste cap of 170%.  I guess that means Verant should re-balance the planes now that 60th level characters with a haste cap of 200% are up there eh?  I suppose that they should lower the power of the planes perhaps 20% to accomodate the sudden haste nerf then increase the difficulty by a good 150% to 200% based upon the fact that the max level in the planes is now 60.<BR>The plane of Air might require rebalancing but since they are looking at that anyway, I do not think that changes much.<P>For those of you that think this affects the Kunark dungeons and they might need to be rebalanced:<BR>Well you claim that an Enchanter is required in Kunark dungeons, so you should still be able to reach the haste cap  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  But I grant you this might require some tweaking  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>The thing that surprises me the most is the people that state it has been this way for so long and Verant has ignored it so it should stay.  I remember quite clearly Gordon stating that they were trying to track it down and would fix it as soon as they found it ... so I guess we chalk this one up to selective hearing!<P> </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001824.cgi&ReplyNum=000061&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Haste+Changes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by AnonEnc:<BR><B>Personally, playing an enchanter...  <P>I think it is a good thing.  Yes, I kinda liked being able to max attack speed on tanks that had a haste item just by casting aug, but..  at least now i feel like i *may* have a use for STLW, AQ, WR, and Visions.  Yes, its more mana to cast these.  But this is the way the game should have worked in the first place, and now it finally does.  So, I can't complain.<P>Besides.  I'm still guessing that a FBSS and an Augment (lvl 56) will get tanks so close to max speed that it wont really matter anyway.<P>Anxious to see haste tests after the patch.</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>This is kind of a backwards attitude isn't it?  I for one couldn't give a rats butt whether SLTW was needed or not.  I have enough things that need my mana in a group that I don't regret the fact that in a group where everyone had haste items, Augmentation would suffice.<P>Standard practice (for me) when joining a group was to inspect each tank to see if they had any haste items.  Usually some did and some didn't.  I would then cast Augmentation on those that did, and Celerity on those that didn't.  In this way those that did have haste items only had to be refreshed every 27 minutes, while those without had to be refreshed (with a higher mana spell) every 13 or so.  It was a big savings in hassle and mana to be able to use Augmentation on those with haste items.<P>Actually *liking* the fact that Augmentation + haste items is now nerfed just so that you can feel more "useful" having to cast SLTW to achieve the same effect is braindead.

</FONT><HR><BR>Aani boggles at how Verant feels ok by changing a complete environment in a snap.<P>Well one thing off the bat.. playing on TZ most people haven't had a haste item for most of the time (I'm on the light team, we didn't have lguk camping for a long time).  So I'd actually get Celerity and STLW work outside pets.  And someone else might memorize vigor (especially for those with wurmslayers).  But lets say I was more like the blue server or how it's been more lately -this issue is more PvE than anything.<P>So lets look at the 'new world' and how groups might deal with it.<P>Invigor line just became much more important/useful outside being underwater<BR>-as did hybrids handling it and casters with free slots not doing as much (druids, other?)<BR>Cobalt Breastplate got even more desirable.<BR>Or any other armor/item with invigorate recast.<P>Slow line just became a *lot* more important/useful<BR>-hello shamans (some of you crying foul), people are *really* going to want those slows<BR>-enchanters will simply -not- have the mana to max speed and cc AND slow and keep up.<P>*OR* if can't get your slows,<P>Chain stunning just became a lot more important/useful<BR>-enchanters will be too busy medding from those buffs.  again hybrids/others stunning will be of use to keep the beats down, or a second enchanter focused on that primarily.<BR>In general people will want a slower first though, particularly on the zeks in regards to area stuns (which can cause issues).  But laying on the target and area stuns have their place and a lot of classes can do this.<P>People might get back to damage shielding more<BR>-mobs last longer, mob hits more, mob gets hurt more.  Varies with how much slow/stun, but if you're in for the long haul..<P>Charm might circulate more<BR>-and it's *not* just enchanters (they're too busy speeding anyways), Bards, Necros, Druids.. if you can throw a mob at it they make up for a PC speed hit pretty fast.<P>Welcome back to the fold mages?<BR>-longer duration you need some real damage soakers, where the pet is almost forgotten in the era of tankage, you may want the earth pet and dmg shields and mage/healer on it.. mix with some memblurs more work can be done to shift damage to it.  Plus they're still a nice DoT  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>Nuke it down!<BR>-Hey, this is just taking too long?  Having wizards and mages with their biggest bangs might serve some real use.  When's the last time outside of planar gating did you *need* that wizard?  Now burndown might be a little more critical than just beatdown here and there.<P>Tanks utilize new skills<BR>-Taking turns the disciplines can work some pretty powerful stuff.  Don't treat it as a panic button, but rotate with your group members for more throughput.<P>Snare/fear<BR>-Some cases you just can't do, but instead of it being a nice idea where you can, do it more, if they don't flee on their own at low health give them incentive.  Just be wary of snare duration times and proximity of enemies.  This can be used more though, several classes can fear and do some kind of snare.  Yeah it's bravado for the tanks to pummel it to submission.. but we don't got all day, especially if we want to keep Verant from draining ourselves out fully each pull.  But season to taste.<P>Return of the DoT<BR>-hey remember that odd necro or two who *wants* a group?  Tag the right target or the enchanter will kill you, but otherwise Necros, Shammies and Druids can add some significant lumps, and Verant just made it longer for us to kill.. so.. do it heh.  If you don't have a Shaman and/or Druid atleast I'd be suprised.  And again for slow and dot (and buffs) Shaman's still a hot item.<P>Clerics, Bards even more essential<BR>-you need the best heal for the buck, and healing after helps too (hybrids).  Mana will be such a premium and Bards are the ultimate downtime reducers.  I don't get the whining, yeah ok speed song maybe isn't as desired, but mana, health, damage shield, vigor.. all these weaves off the top of my head are useful.  And when the haste is dropping off a tank and the enchanter is medding (happily to clarity and your pulse) since they're all on rotation you *immediately* keep them up to snuff till the enchanter can push out another rotation.<P>And I'm just getting warm folks.<BR>Yes it bites.  Yes it defies what Verant has said before, even what Verant called this issue before (it wasn't a bug but by design previously).  But Verant couldn't balance if you shipped them 100 verified perfect scales.  They try with their tunnel Vision (tm) but they lack common sense (seriously, but that's for another time).  So we have to make do.  Anyone saying this is an enchanter blessing is *nuts*.  Do you know how much we want to toy with swapping spells, different speed lines, and spending x3 mana for half duration?  I laugh at any enchanter liking this.. saying a low level enchanter could do what he could.  Ok.. but now you just got about 1/4 as effective with your speeding.  Yes a golden day indeed.  I'm just not as pissed because I'm used to people not having the haste items.  Sure there should be a use for the different spells, but I got *loads* of useless spells already, I'm used to it.  Saying I now have spell differention and I'm the master of speed doesn't take away the fact I could do a lot more for a lot longer for a lot less so excuse me if I don't thank you.  DUH.<P>I don't see all these rampant deaths happening everywhere though.  If they do you never learned how to play your character.  Yes this *sucks* for the *BIG* targets, hell the speed buffs will drop while you're preparing.  And some of them don't stun or slow so well.  But places in general?  You still should be doing proper CC.  On TZ we have less light enchanters.. nerf after nerf plus pvp nerfs we're in short supply.  But others know CC roles.  I group with a *paladin* who's a better back up crowd controller than many enchanters.  Bards and Enchanters can swap charm roles when a drop happens.  Spread your wings guys, if you're envisioning nonstop death you've really dumbed down the game.  It sucks, we have to work harder, it's already a pain in the butt, and Verant sucks.  Ok we've said it.  They're also arrogant sobs which probably don't care, you'll still come for your crack.  So you gotta put up or shut up.  No class is tossed, most are needed *more than ever* now and really the worst effected is the enchanter who's already pulled apart to do CC everywhere, and now needs to consume *gobs* more mana for tank buffs.<P>Ok finally responses to some posters: <BR>Fahr, look at Bate's post again.<BR>It's pretty simple, and he's right, do the math.<BR>I do agree though, I'd rather *not* have enchanters desired more (busy as is lol).<BR>Bate, your still wrong though.<BR>It nerfed Enchanter's *hard*<BR>That same level 60 needs to use a *lot* more mana to get the same effects.  That's a nerf my boy.  Plain and simple.<BR>Balith, don't be silly.  Your slow is awe inspiring.  That's desired *more* (do people think before posting?).  You have the *best* one of it.  Enchanters won't have mana to do their slow which isn't as good.  You can also drop a dot on it to help out.  And you want stlw?  God I wish you had it, then I could get back to focusing on CC.  But don't you already buff enough?  I'd **much** rather have the premier slow than speed.  While I dazzle and tash my targs I'd slow em all too.  And while your buffing all the tanks you could include your speed.  Guess who spends a lot more as is?  Trade ya!<P>Yeah, Verant bites, this hits *GROUPS* hard folks.  But it isn't a discriminator, all groups throughput will be hurt by it when arriving into the bigger leagues.  Maybe some will come back into the fold more (mages, wizzies, necros, druids) in some ways (damage soakers, fight enders, dots and damage shields), maybe we'll all just hurt more for pure damage output.  But people are so quick to scream 'they got better, we got worse'.  I can't believe Bards and Shamans complaining about enchanters.  We don't want this folks.  The whole group will need mana and vigor and health and maybe a few tricks more than ever.  And the slow and dots of a shaman were very important, now reach critical.  If anything enchanters are the ones who lose what they could do before.  The occasional nuke or dot or probably slow (shammy hopefully) won't show up.  Even back up rooting, rune, stunning (outside for protection) will likely fade.  We'll speed tanks and cc where people don't pull/root well enough.  And clarity and depending maybe resist/group resist magic.  Or we'll be more CC and speed when we can, needing some bard/shammy help.<P>It's a hit to the player base.  Period.<BR>Collectively moon verant, tell'em what ya think, and lets collectively either solve this or take our money elsewhere  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif">  It'd make sense to lower the mana hit of the bigger spells.. I'll bet good money Verant hasn't thought about how hard this will hit groups.  See above.  It's worth making a statement and complaint.  But I haven't been impressed to date.  Maybe they'll do something and prove me wrong.  But even if so they're so damn slow to move (year plus on this one) start thinking about handling it now.<P>And glance at the other MMORPG boards which are only getting closer in the mean time  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif"><P>Aani<P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001824.cgi&ReplyNum=000063&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Haste+Changes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I have to agree that this was a bug that should have been fixed.  However, I can't agree with Abashi that this won't have an effect on game balance.<P>According to VI the difficulty of the game has been balanced for the way things were set up.  We were told time and again that sweeping changes to abilities in the players favor would require them to up the difficulty of all the mobs to compensate.<P><B>Abashi:</B><BR><B>I disagree, fixing the bug pretty much affects everyone equally, and actually benefits people in many cases.</B><P>Your correct here that the change will affect everyone equally, but in no way does it actually benifit anyone from an offensive ability point of view.  The only benifit of this is that it makes high end haste gear worth more in the economy.<P><B>Abashi:</B><BR><B>I imagine that most were unaware of the bug and were buffing with maximum haste anyway.</B><P>Actually this was not the case for the majority.  Every player that I have personally gamed with, quite a few, has been aware that any haste spell and any haste item pushes that person to the haste cap.  It has been a known bug for months.  I personally use a FBSS and have never asked for anything higher than Augmentation.  Mainly for the reason that I knew there would be no difference if I got a better haste spell cast upon me.  This topic has been talked about on almost every message board I have ever seen.  To say that most people were unawar of the bug is an error.  Just as the statement about most enchanters using the best haste spell possible was also an error as most of them just use augmentation.  At least this is the case in my experience while playing multiple planes capable characters. <P><B>Abashi:</B><BR><B>Now they can be secure in their spells meaning something. Not to mention, we can now look forward to the value of the different haste items being appropriate as well.</B><P>This is the one part of your post that is correct.  It is true that now Enchanters, Shamen, and Bards can know that by using a higher level spell they will be providing their group members with more haste than if they did not use their higher level spell.  However, to the players, enchanters, Bards, Shamen, and all the melee that use haste items.  What this has effectively done is nerfed them in comparison to their previous abilities.<BR>I can't think of a reason why, prior to this change, that anyone with a haste item would have wanted any spell other than Augmentation.  As an Enchanter I can't imagine wanting to cast any other spell other than Augmentation.  All the other forms of hasting spells require more mana and last less time.  The only 2 exceptions are Augment(56) and Visions of Grandeur(60) whch both have durations longer than Augmentation.<BR>Effectively what this patch has done is to increase the mana output requirement of Enchanters and Shamen as people will now be requesting haste spells with higher costs and lower duration to be just as effective as they were prior to the patch.<P>Over all I have to agree that the patch was necessary and that prior to the patch the Haste System was bugged.  However, I disagree with the spin you used to correct the issue.  The benifit of the patch to players is only positive for those owning high end haste items, and even then its only an economic benifit.  If possible please tell me what other "BENEFIT" this change has on any player who stays even remotely informend?<P><P>------------------<BR>Lomack<BR>Brotherhood of the Crimson Knights,<BR>www.bck.org</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001824.cgi&ReplyNum=000064&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Haste+Changes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Well put posts Parm and Citra.

Well, it had been a known bug for a very long time, and has even been class tuned for and performance tested with.

</FONT><HR> <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Grom of Tunare:<BR><B>This is lovely. I just got an FBSS not too long ago, and I was loving it because I could finally solo specs with my shadowknight at lvl 40. I couldn't solo too much really though, because I would run out of mana really fast. Then they gave us hybrids more mana! Yay! Now I have a bit more mana and I can solo the specs more efficiently now. This is a nice option to have when I can't seem to find a group anywhere with my shadowknight. But now, they are going to lower the haste on FBSS. Thanks.</B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P><BR>They aren't lowering the speed of an FBSS.  They are lowering the amount by which any arbitrary haste spell increases the haste of an FBSS when cast on the wearer of an FBSS.<P>Say the FBSS hastes by 24%.  Say that Augmentation hastes by 30%.  Well, since they stack, there are two ways in which it would be logical for them to stack.  The first way is additive.  That is, 24% + 30% = 54% haste.  The second logical way is multiplicative, that is, 124% x 130% = 161%<P>These ways are logical and make sense.  The thing is, it didn't work this way.  The way it worked until today was that *any* haste spell in combination with *any* haste item would automatically bring you up to the maximum allowable haste level.<P>The result of today's nerf is not to lower the effect of an FBSS, it is rather to lower (primarily) the effect of the lvl 29 enchanter spell Augmentation on those wearing an FBSS (or wielding a mith 2hander or whatever).<P>While today's nerf brings us to what is in actuality logical, it is a fact that Norrath was balanced up till today with the previous, illogical stacking behavior.  Changing the stacking behavior now invalidates the level of balance, and creates a new level of balance which is more in the mobs' favor than things were yesterday and the past year and a half.  That is what we are griping about.<P>Also, given the illogic and downright hubris of Abashi in dealing with some other stacking anomalies, eg: Mez spells of a higher lvl not overwriting lower level mez spells, and the whole "it's a bug, no it's not a bug" fiasco, it was not entirely wrong of us to assume that Verant *meant* for haste items and haste spells to stack in the old way.<P>Just thought I would attempt to clarify this for those who weren't aware.<BR><P>------------------<BR>Parm Vomgrossenhirn of Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001824.cgi&ReplyNum=000066&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Haste+Changes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>So what I am seeing is that all the sudden people have to think about some new tactics and use more spells than before?  The game perhaps got more challenging for upper level players?  Yay!  It just works out nice that a bug fix could actually benefit the game this way.<P>It is very very interesting to see what you can do with different classes mixed together.  Complete Heal and AE Mez are great spells, but darn it, some people rely on them like a crutch.  People find the one way that works, and then they stick with it, and rarely try new things.  Boring boring boring.<P>Thank goodness they changed this, it has made things more interesting.  It opens the door for more items with haste, which is one of the few ways to enhance melee types.  So there used to be one path to take (FBSS + Aug), now there are many more options.  I bet some of the VP loot will have some amazing haste effects, and could be an underlying reason this change was made now.  There are only so many parameters you can put on items, and haste is one of the more interesting and powerful things.<P>I think this to some extent hurts the current set of lower level people, and that is frustrating.  You can see the battleworn guy in the corner of the tavern saying, "Yep, we used to take mob M out with only N level L people with only N2 being from class C in T amount of time to get nice item X."  Of course that is quite a few variables in there, and well who is to say you cannot do it with a different setup?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=001824.cgi&ReplyNum=000073&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=Haste+Changes">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">
