</FONT><HR>I think it's pretty funny how people perceive the fact they "can't" play without good gear.<P>As any old-timer can tell you, there was a time when we simply had no idea where the good gear even was, or even WHAT it was. We thought combine swords rocked, and the BBC was nice, even if it had a bad agi penalty. Bronze or store bought armor was the best anyone had, until we hit levels sufficient for Cazic and the infamous rubicite.<P>My point is that at level 32 when I quit EQ originally, I was wearing a FBR, and the Oracle robe had <I>just</I> been discovered. We had, at a level spread of 30-40 max on the server, just begun to find the items that are so commonplace now.<P>Know what? We still kicked ass. It's just that now that everyone knows about this 'l33t g34r', everyone thinks they should have it. And there is a large enough proportion of people playing long hours that the economy has a significant number of these items available. I for one like good loot as much as the next guy, but it matters not a bit if I don't have as good loot as others my level, because I can guarantee you they in most cases did not get it with the character wearing it.<P>I sort of chuckle at low level characters in great gear. It robs much of the game's progression. I was so happy when I actually got my first FBR, because I got it myself. If a guy is given an Oracle robe, great, but he will be wearing it for 30 more levels or so until he can get a new one. I will take a stat/ac hit at lower levels for the chance to advance through gear naturally as well as levels.<P>/ramble<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000100&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I agree with Gordon's response. Once items become attainable by 'casual' gamers, they'll be way too easy to get, and then, why have them? They wouldn't be special anymore. They'd just be a common item anyone could pick up.<P>And what does that poster think he's talking about, that young people have tons of time to play the game? I'm 13, and the most I've played yet is 4 1/2 hours. Simple reason: I go to school. Of course, school's out in two weeks, so I'll be playing a lot more--and gladly. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000101&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>wow, tptb at verant should read all these posts as i have just done, it could be a real eye-opener ... while it is true that many people just whine for the sake of whining, i think that the content of these posts speak of the "hot-button" issue regarding everCamp and class unbalance and higher levels and powergamers ... that reply was whack imho, and i speak from a "casual gamer" perspective ... the fact that so many posts have appeared here should send a red flag to verant, but i guess the bottom line for them is that people arn't dropping their subscriptions in droves, so if it ain't "truly" broke ...<P>first off, i left the game for 6-8 month span due entirely to this issue - my level 28 bard cannot solo (i haven't got the charm kiting tactic down yet - and even so it is boring to do that and tough to find a pair - at least for me - of NPCs to pull it off ...) - i started other characters and have a bunch all approaching the 20s ... right now i am doing a magician because of the solo-ability but even as a casual gamer i am denied items that would increase my solo-ability which leads to my 2nd point ...<P>... which is, that the items that would help someone solo more effective (j-boots, +mana, +int, uber-weapons, etc ...) are only available to long camps by the "powergamers" or job-less gamers or ... and as the "powergamer" gets a character up to the top (50s), then he/she can twink his/her other characters, allowing rapid progression through levels, while the casual gamer once they hit the mid 20s is forced into the dilemna of knowing that long play sessions are necessary if the session is going to be meaningful (any XP gain) ... sorry, but j-boots make a world of difference for any class, as do +mana, +int items ...<P>it is extremely frustrating for higher level characters i have played ... as a support programer in RL, i find my time to play in odd allotments, and not in regular slots so it is difficult to find a set of players to "level up" along side with ... so you are in mistmoore, log in at 5a PST, and find noone there - well, even for the solo classes, it may be difficult to impossible to solo inside a dungeon ... and the places where you may solo or find another or two to group with may take you most of the allotted time you have to play ...<P>what can be done about this problem of the casual gamer? <P>well, without even going into in-depth analysis with focus groups, i offer the following simple brainstormed suggestions:<P>* make the loot drops more random - make it so all NPCs of a certain group and certain zone could potentially drop such desireable item ...<P>* more quests to get the armor that there isn't one single quest/mob to do/kill ... maybe tie some of the quests to trade skills ...<P>* fix the broken economy ... there should be items at high level that can be bought that are similar to the good loot dropped but maybe not as good but close ... also, make the trade skills count for something ... there are still tailoring recipes broken - it would be nice if there was magical armor that could be crafted by tailors or weapons that could be smithed by blacksmiths and enchanted to be magical by enchanters ... there are so many things that could be done here - i know a lot were "geeked" over the kunark expansion but i think it's kind of pathetic that there are bugs and issues with the original release that still haven't been addressed ... i'm sure many of you have a list ... if not, i would be happy to elaborate my list ...<P>* zone balancing - there are still zones that are empty while others are over-camped - there is a good reason for that and if you look at zone traffic across servers, i am wagering that you would pick up the trend ...<P>i am writing this in a hurried state, so i am leaving out some thoughts but i think yall get the gist of this ...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000102&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I understand why you are upset, I do, quest can take a terribly long time to complete, earning certain items can take almost forever! <BR>BUT<BR>This is a world of adventures and quest, not of items and levels. I play a 53 magician, you probably picture a power player, SMR (or plane) gold boots etc.  But I wear a Oracle robe and modest equipment, not that I don't camp itemes, they are just not a priority.  I admit I have more time to play then the "casual gamer," however realize that being a casual gamer in EQ can still be fun. Its the people that make eq fun, and the thrill and challenge of adventure.<BR>Furthermore, I would like to address the new exp 51+.  Many people I know have deemed these levels ridiculous.  Well in a sense they are, what you earn for the amount of time it takes seems a bit crazy.  On the other hand when you do achieve 60 or any other level for that matter it is a bit more of an accomplishment.  I don't like it much, but I understand it.<BR>In the end everyone stop complaining all the time, this game is your world not theirs.

</FONT><HR>I think the game has aspects that are designed for the casual gamer, but a large portion is not. The comment about a 72 minute spawn being ok is fine, if the item in question is just loot dropped by a specific mob. If the item is part of a quest, then I think the spawn time is MUCH too long for a casual gamer.<P>I had an experience that I think is exactly what the EQ designers want with my druid finding the Skull of Jen'tra [sp?]. I stumbled on the mob and was in a fight that was a bit too tough for me at the time. Luckily someone helped me finish it off and I got the loot. I was very surprised and delighted to find the Skull. I never went out of my way to find it, I just stumbled on it while exploring. That is the way "random" loot should be hunted, and I don't mind week-long spawn times for such mobs.<P>However, I've now started an Iksar Necro and am doing the low-level skullcap quests. One of them requires me finding and killing an apparently rare mob. I've spent days searching for it. I've asked people in the Zone if they've seen it and have searched web sites to find the specific area in the Zone to search. From what I've found, the creature is an uncommon or rare spawn in an area that is much higher level than the mob in question. I spent hours searching that area, and I can't do anything else since the other mobs are too high level to fight. This is very boring. In addition, another part of this quest involved killing an uncommon mob that other classes are hunting for. Because we all have to kill multiple of these creatures, people spend hours or days just trying to get enough kills. Again, that is boring.<P>I think that quest items should be on very short timers. While it is nice to say you should play and find what you can rather than hunting for specific items, the nature of a quest is to hunt for a specific item. To make that item then be on a long spawn is annoying at best. In addition, collecting all the no drop items you find in the hopes they may be needed in a quest is a waste of vault space. :-)<P>One additional comment, I'd like to be able to sell those no drop items (especially the ones that vendors give a price for) for the cash once I realize I won't be able to use them (a big problem in the Kurnak newbie areas). Just make the vendor not resell them.<P>--Brett</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000105&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I think abashi is all wet. I have been a casual gamer for more than a year and it is clear to me that ALL of the most usefull items are unattainable for the casual gamer. <BR>Now I agree that people who put in more time are going to get more and better items. Does this mean that a casual gamer should end up with none of the better items? Alot of the class specific stuff is no drop so you can't even buy it. When a spawn only pops once in 3 hours, for the rare mob and the rare drop if you don't camp it you are out of the running. In paticular the item that they are talking about is a mid level monk item. This strikes me as a bit ridiculus. I think it stinks most of the mid level class specific items are out of reach without prolonged camping. I personally don't have 40 hours to kill every weekend trying to get my class specific items. And keep in my these are not the top notch items but mid level class specific items. How in the world would I get even one of the really long camp items? When we complain we get some tripe about how "not everyone can have every item" well I would settle for just some. Unfortunately it is very difficult to get any of the class specific stuff without "Evercamping". Man I wish they would take a clue and throw us casual gamers a bone.  </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000106&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Wow! now that is a LOT of posts for the time this topic has been up!<P>I think the last post makes a lot of sense  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P><BR>What I did read here it seemed that the powergamers are happy the way it is and the 'casual gamers' are not. What does that tell you?<P><BR>NO ONE has suggested that items should be EASY to get. We are suggesting that we would rather QUEST than CAMP. Camping is jsut about bearable if you are in a dungeon or something where there are other things about that you would usually hunt anyway (i.e. the mob that drops the item is surrounded by a bunch that aren't MUCH weaker than it).<BR>In this case, fine, make the spawn as rare as you like. VI have said they won't randomise good loot and I can respect their argument for this BUT why should the named NPC that dropd the nice kit always be in the same place?<BR>And if it is because said NPC needs his retunue then that could easily be aranged by putting the whole group of NPCs on the same spawn site (so they all spawn or none of them in any given spot).<P>Now WHY oh WHY can't you put good items in good quests that DO NOT involve long rare camps. Give it as many parts as you like but make each one possible without taking AGES. By all means put them in tough inaccessible places -preferably in ways appropriate to their class.<P>Finally THERE IS NO POSSIBLE EXCUSE FOR MAKING THINGS 'no rent'! NONE WHATSOEVER.

</FONT><HR>Well, I would have to say that EQ tries to be fair to all as much as possible, but, you just cant please everyone all the time. I feel the biggest problem to the casual player, besides those long camps that require you to be on 8 hrs straight or more, is the fact that the higher level you get, the more time EQ demands from you to continue to do things that are new and fruitful for your character. Anyone who has a 40+ character knows what I mean. I mean look at it...in order to go to the planes or to engage a dragon, with any hope of success, means getting multi-groups together, like no less then 20, AND having a minimum of 8hrs to play. That just saps it for me, not to mention the fact that in huge multi-groups I personaly just dont have as much fun being just this little cog in a big machine. Hell, I get that in RL, I dont want it in my virtual entertainment world. Kunark has helped though, and I have yet to discover all there is over there. But, I find myself not wanting to log on Pelmen very much anymore, cause I dont feel I ever have the time to do anything with him now that he is 44th, with out spending 4 hours or more anyway. What I see happening is I will slowly ween myself off EQ, as there is nothing to keep me coming back for just a few hours of enjoyment. <BR>See you all on the other side,<BR>Pelmen</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000108&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I would agree that some (ok, many) of the best items are beyond the abilities of the casual gamer to get. I play about 20 to 30 hours a week - casual by some estimations. I've currently got 4 characters that I actually care about and have put some time into. The highest level character of them is 30 rogue (god, I hate that level (g)). I've got some pretty decent gear on him - dual SBDs (thanks Kanbyen!), some Ravenscale (mostly bought), a couple of nice pieces of jewelry. However, this 30 rogue is still wearing the Crush Tunic he got at 10, the derv ring he got at 5, and a couple of pieces of banded. Would I like an RS tunic? Oh ya! Would I like to replace the banded? Yes again. Do I make it a high priority to get the most wonderful gear in the world? No. I make it a priority to have fun. Sometimes it's fun to camp the long spawn and get that special item, but most times, it's not worth it.<P>However, it's obvious Verant realizes that alot of people don't feel like I do. They just gotta have that special item. With Kunark, I think they've done a bang up job correcting that problem. A good example here would be the lumberjacks cap - nice item; it's light, ac something like 10, a few other pluses (agi? str? don't remember). How do you get it? Kill giants. Not any specific giant mind you, just any old giant wandering around in FV. No long boring camping there - find a giant village and start killing - about 1 in 20 (it seemed) will have a cap. Now that's fun and works for me. However, remember, camping long spawns still has it's place...some people actually *like* long spawn camping (shudder).

</FONT><HR>I would love to know the secrets of people who claim to make high levels without more than mundane equipment.<P>I know that as a 20th level gnome cleric, it's impossible to solo.  I've tried it, I can't.  Maybe if I had a few neat items I could, but I don't have them.<P>I would like to group a lot, but it takes time to find a group.  And I'd like to be doing something besides nothing while waiting to find a group.  I don't mind if the game is designed to make grouping more rewarding, but there should be at least something with minimal reward for me to do while waiting.<P>The game has a lot of waiting time built into it- long distances to get places, waiting on boats, long spawn times.  That is what kills enjoyment for the casual gamer.<P>Why not make non-twinked soloing possible, but grouping more rewarding?  Why not randomize some spawns or drops so they can't be camped as effectively?  More items don't need to be added, but obtaining them could be made far less predictable so that camping is discouraged.<P>If the game designers feel that camping is so valuable, maybe the very best items can be made available only through camping, but casual gamers can be thrown a bone by being given shots at items that are still special.<P>And contrary to what some posters have suggested, it would seem that the casual gamer is potentially more profitable to Verant.  We pay the same money and put less of a strain on Verant's resources.<P>Verant has some good ideas, but has ultimately shown that it's too rigid in adhering to the 'vision.'  I'm confident that designers of similar games are listening to the casual gamers and are going to come up with a better product soon to which we can divert our money.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000112&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>C'mon guys get a life.  This is a GAME.  Do you really want something that takes your quarter and is over in 2 minutes?  I agree that the "COOL" stuff is almost impossible to get for the casual gamer, but do you play only for stuff?  I feel that EQ is a great social environment and should be relayed as such, not just a shoot-em-up and WIN type game.  If that is what you want I'm sure the makers of Quake will thank you.<P>In reality, the casual gamer cannot survive at higher levels without being able to solo.  With Verant's ultra group oriented policies and "class-balancing" this almost limits a player to a necro or mage.  I'm sorry for you casual gamers if you thought that cool troll warrior, barbarian shaman, or eudite wizard was going to the only character you would ever need.  But the casual gamer will never get the solo experience needed to get to level 60 without a group.  Saying this a different way: "By the time you get to level 40 soloing with 'most' characters, you will be so disenchanted that you will NEVER want to play the game."<P>So I say find a good friend or two, get their e-mail, and do some planning.  You might just get luck and find that rare named spawn.  Who knows, he might even drop that (insert item here) that you always wanted.<P>I do agree that some of the quests should be changed to give more experience.  Not ones that are really simple and can be repeated again and again with no penalty. (Read Tumpy tonics)  Just some that the casual gamer can start, keep doing at his/her leisure, and finish with a "cool" item and lots of experience.  (Without spending tons of hours of sitting in one location waiting for the 10% chance drop of that overcamped spawn.)  And I suggest to Verant that these types of quests do have numerous (and ordered) steps to complete.  Kind of like the Staff of the Wheel Quest without all the high level spawn killing.  And yes quests should be level specific but NOT class, race, and god specific.<P>Just my 2 pp...  what do you THINK</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000113&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Didn't read the whole thread, so I am uncertain if anyone already brought this up, but Gordon's reasoning is flawed.<P>He says that maybe players shouldn't be designing their playtime around attaining items... WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK A F*CKING QUEST IS?  PULL YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS.<P>Item camps can take as long as you want them too (I think that common drops should be made rare, and rare drops should be made VERY rare myself, discourage camping severely), but quests are NOT camps according to YOU (when we ask for alternatives to camping, you always bring up questing).<P>A camp is a long period of waiting puncuated by a single large moment of gratification at the end.  A quest should be a more gradual and fulfilling process, which might be several smaller camps across the globe that yield an item and some experience.<P>This is an EXCELLENT concept, but like all things Verant screwed it up.  The camps for each quest piece are often as lengthy as camps for full-fledged dungeon loot, and the experience is PISS POOR or NONEXISTENT.<P>And as a cleric, I can second the orginal posters complaints.  All of the quests were pretty damn boring and painful (it was kinda cool running around deep inside Runnyeye, but that's it).  The bracer quest represents the absolute worst of the bunch, which is funny because the bracer is the only truly worthwhile piece.<P>Methinks Verant has an especially nasty and deliberate sense of humor.<P>I would love Everquest if you there were about three times as many useful item quests, all of which required MANDATORY speech with all pertinent NPCs, dozens of smaller pieces and MINOR camps that could be accomplished in an hour or so, and if quests rewarded you with about a bubble of experience your first time through (if the quest is considered difficult given your level, maybe if you needed a group to complete it).<P>FIX QUESTS IN EVERQUESTS.  MAKE THE GAME FUN.

</FONT><HR>No. Along with option/idea, is also the desirability of this game to help/allow people to add/pursue other means of playing that are not totally "EverKill" oriented. Some of us also want to add a certain amount of fun to the game to make it palatable to ourselves and others that are not trapped into the carrot mentality of the Uber item. While it would be difficult to measure, the game should reward these people some for their "advancement" and help in making the game a special place to be.<P>Verant could cater to those players a lot more. Yes, this could be abused some, but all in all there are many people and players that do not abuse this game.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000119&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I've been playing EQ since beta 4, and I'm not a "casual gamer".  I've read Gordon's posts for a long time now.  Granted that he's under constant bombardment from whiners and complainers, but I MUST say this, "Many of his responses to posts I've read come off sounding very arrogant and callous."  In short... I've come to the conclusion that he's full of self-importance... among other odiferous fecal matter.<BR>Let's get honest here.  Gordon is looking out for #1, like any business person.  Money talks, and he's got to pay the bills.  The customer does NOT come first.  Job/income security comes first.  Drop the notion that customer satisfaction is job security.  In the longrun it is, but this game will be history in the shortrun and people will move on to the newest and hottest game down the pike.<BR>In short, it's useless to try to appeal to Verant from the "customer satisfaction"/"if you really cared about us" aspect.<BR>I never post replies, but Gordon's latest "My best advice to you is..." really brought out my ire.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000120&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I have never heard so much whinning in my entire life.  How cares if the game caters to the casual gamer.  Tough if you cant get everything your heart desires in the game.  What makes Everquest so unique, as well as fascinating is the unpredictability.  There may be some aspects that are not fair from an uniformed perspective, but THATS LIFE, which the game attempts to emmulate in way that emmerses the player.  Pleas whatever you do, dont change anything!  If  you dont like go play a 1st person shooter and there you can get anything you want.

</FONT><HR>There is a very simple solution to the casual gamer dilemma, and I'm hoping that Kunark is the start of it. Instead of putting the same item on the same mob every single time, put a little randomness in the mix. Everyone knows that if you want an FBSS, you need to get in line for the Frenzied Ghoul CAMP in LGuk. But what if that Hill Giant roaming in NK has a chance(mind you a VERY SMALL chance) of dropping one? The powergamers could keep camping the Frenzied and keep getting FBSS's at the same rate, and once in a great while, the casual gamer who is out in the world fighting at his own pace might come across a decent item or two. Verant has responded before that they don't like this, because it "affects the storylines in the game". I'd like to know what storyline tells you that the Frenzied has the FBSS, the Supplier has the TBB, etc? It's good to see this thread here. Verant tries to pace the game according to those gamers at the higher levels, with the best gear. In doing so, they are overlooking the bulk of their customers who are further down the bell curve. Keep up the noise.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000122&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Gordon spoke:<P>"The best advice I could offer to people in your prediciment would be to play the game first, and see what items you get, ..."<P>Predicament.<P>That about sums it up, doesn't it?  Someone who spends fifty bucks for the game, pays Gordon's employer ten a month, and makes time to play 20 hours a week to advance his character is in a predicament.  <P>Listen up, Verant.  If you want to be taken seriously by players over the age of 14, you better do something about the attitude.  This guy, who seems to be representative of quite a few of your customers, is telling you what's wrong with your product.  He's telling you that your product has problems for people who fit his playing profile.  He's even offered suggestions for how to improve the game in that regard.  You don't want to cater to his tastes?  Fine, don't expect him to buy your next product.  You want to hold fast to all this malarky about The Vision?  No problem - you can have The Vision.  People will play a game that they can enjoy and be successful with at a pace that fits THEIR Vision, not yours.  <P>This is why people come to hate being a Verant customer.  Not because the product stinks (it doesn't), not because the players you meet are jerks (most aren't); no, the thing that pisses most people off about this company is the attitude.  You people at Verant are taking yourselves WAY too seriously.  This is not Art, fellas.  It's a computer game.  The sooner you drop the "you're not worthy" attitude about players who put in 20 hours a week the better your reputation will be both as a company and (assuming you make game changes) as game designers.  Frankly, I don't see that ever happening, but I'd love to be suprised.<P>Predicament.  <P>Get off it.<P>MrP</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=3&topic=000977.cgi&ReplyNum=000124&forum=Burning+Issues&TopicSubject=The+Casual+Gamer">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 7 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-6.html">6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum3/HTML/000977-7.html">7</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000977&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum3&number=3&thisthread=000977&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
