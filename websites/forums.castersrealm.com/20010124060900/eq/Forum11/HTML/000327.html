</FONT><HR>I'll be honest.  I surfed over to this message board to see how "the enemy" gets along.  I wasn't going to post, just lurk about for a bit and then go but...<P>You're all so dang nice here...<BR>To be honest that really confuses me because on Norrath well...<BR>Ok let me start by saying that I'm not here to flame anyone, but in two years plus of play I have only ever met six Druids that I trust, and maybe a handful more that I liked.<BR>I've told a friend of mine (one of the six Druids on the list as a matter of fact) that I hate her kind with a passion brighter than the sun.  Offense meant by this, I dont like Druids, dont trust them, cant say I enjoy grouping with them, and really dislike being around them.<BR>That out of the way, here's my question.<BR>Where are the nice Druids in game?  Have I just been running into all the kill stealing, Ebay and Tumpy babies with no social skills and even less desire to help out there fellows?  Are there actually more than six nice Druids out there?  If so, where?  This whole thing really galls me especially because, being a High Elven Paladin of Tunare you would think that I'd be close with my fellows, even the more rustic ones...but...I cant turn a blind eye when all I see are Wood Elves with names like "Skycab" and "Imamule" kiting Dwarven guards around BB.  (yeah theres a pastime for a "goodly race")  <P>I'd say I was sorry to go on a rant about this here, but I'm really not.  I've at least tried to keep it civilized tho.<P>Shassiana Argentfox<BR>Freesword of Tunare<BR>Povar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=11&topic=000327.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General&TopicSubject=A+very+serious+question">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>There are plenty of people that play druids that are very nice.  I played a druid on e'ci and i was very nice to people... i think it is more likely a problem with your particular server than anything else.  I also play all different kinds of characters though, not just druids, perhaps that  has something to do with it.  I have met plenty of nice ones on e'ci and luclin, and a few on rallos zek too =)   heheh yes, i get around, have played on all of those servers, and povar too actually, though didnt play a character over lev 16 there.  Gnarlly the gnome wizard, caric the woodelf ranger, and fenric, wood elf druid.  Paige pureheart was the name of the druid on e'ci.  On luclin my main is a mage named celebril, and i grouped with several really cool druids on that server... namely Alquaya, Lupy, Geep, Genelani, Rouginos,and Coils to name just a couple of them.  Anyways, good luck to you, and i hope you meet some  of the nicer ones.  Oh, by the way, how is the povar server these days?  been a long time since i was there... any roleplayers left at all? is the high level community nice there? been considering going back there someday =)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=11&topic=000327.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=General&TopicSubject=A+very+serious+question">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Argentfox, I'm sorry to say I know exactly what you mean.  I play on Innoruuk server and I have a wide circle of friends of all classes, but for the most part, many of the druids I've met and have had the misfortune to group with have really been truly dreadful people.<P>I'm in a small guild and there are alot of druids in it (seems to me almost everybody these days has a druid character just like everybody has a high level necro hidden away somwhere ;-) and all the druids in the my guild are nice and there are a few other nice druids out there, I've met them and keep in touch with them.  However it's true to say that the majority of druids I've come into contact with are greedy, untrustworthy, anti-social and just out for what they can get, everybody else be damned  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/frown.gif"><P>I'm not entirely sure what it is, I suspect partly the druids inate ability to solo well tends to lead to anti-social types selecting the class (ditto Necromancers, of which I also have a high level).<P>I'm a druid and I'm extremely skeptical if my group decided to take on another druid who I don't know, it's pretty bad when you get like that  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/frown.gif">  Necro's get a pretty bad wrap too, but as a necro and a druid, most of the necro's I've met are truly wonderful people :-P<P>Shanya Wolfreaver<BR>49th level Druid<BR>Innoruuk Server</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=11&topic=000327.cgi&ReplyNum=000004&forum=General&TopicSubject=A+very+serious+question">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Not possible ... at least with you are speaking about Halfling Druid. <P>I'm playing on Fennin Ro and I haven't heard about Druid being Jerk ...<BR>I'm 40, Use to group with guild members mostly but I never had trouble finding a group so far even with stranger. But unfortunately, I think that some people are so used to solo that they don't know how to play in a group and they have become bear minded people. Even Druid is the second best solo class, I'm not soloing more than 20% of the time and only if I play for 1 or 2 hours so it will be too long to look for a group.<P>Signed:<BR>A Friendly Druid</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=11&topic=000327.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=General&TopicSubject=A+very+serious+question">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

Hope to bump into you soon =)<P>I got into Tupp myself. very nice people in there, but Id say the whole server is full of extremely nice people.<P>Malton McPorter <B>*Tupp*</B><BR>29 halfling druid, of Karana<BR>bristlebane<p>[This message has been edited by Malton_2000 (edited January 02, 2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=11&topic=000327.cgi&ReplyNum=000006&forum=General&TopicSubject=A+very+serious+question">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I occasionally feel that way about druids, and I play one...Povar (where I play) has a fair number of anti-social, guard-camping, and generally less-than-pleasant druids.<P>There are nice druids out there -- I know several, and I try to be one.  I think part of the problem is that there are a lot of people who play druids because 1.) they solo well, and 2.) they get some nifty abilities...and once they've soloed for 30-odd levels they forget their social skills.  Or something like that.<P>That, and I think a lot of them get really sick of being asked for SoW's, TP's, etc. -- I've had people show up while I was grouped with a druid and start begging for TP's while we were very obviously in the middle of fighting something.  My druid is only 20th, so she only gets asked for SoW's and occasionally binds, which I usually don't mind giving out.  (As a note, high-level shaman get the same thing from people wanting buffs -- my husband has been known to go anon and invis before going through newbie areas just to avoid newbies begging for buffs.)<P>A good, trustworthy druid is a great group member -- I've both grouped with druids and played one.  I admit that one of the reasons I play a druid is because she can solo better than any of my other characters, but I have a lot more fun in a good group.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=11&topic=000327.cgi&ReplyNum=000007&forum=General&TopicSubject=A+very+serious+question">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Part of it may also be that you just don't meet the nice ones because we are just minding our own business and not getting in anyone's way.  I will say that sometimes we do get short when constantly bugged for SoW's, TP and various other buffs.  There's not much worse than when you are in the middle of a tough fight and you get some bozo getting in front of you giving you tells begging for stuff. Somehow I don't think you're that kind of person though.  You seem to have just run into a lot of bad druids.  You have obviously thought about what you were doing and going to say and this wasn't a kneejerk reaction post.

</FONT><HR>Thank you all for the input.  I had some thoughts to add to this thread over the last few days and so without further ado...<P>1) It is possible that with the larger numbers of people playing its harder to find the good among the bad.  That makes sense to me, unfortunately it dosen't solve my problem with the Druids I've met.<P>2) While I can see the justification for Halfling, Human and Wood Elf Druids camping Ogre Guards and Even Freeport Militia, I can't see the reasoning behind them doing the same with Dwarves from an in character standpoint.  Ok Ok fine if you're doing it for the eps I understand, just don't expect any respect...especially if you're a Halfling.  I thought you short folk were supposed to stick together.  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif"><P>3) As far as kiting goes, Paladins can at certain levels kite to some effect.  Spectres in the Oasis can be successfully fear kited.  I've never had a problem with kiting so long as it wasn't kited over me.  Unfortunately this last seems to be the common response when the kiter realizes that their in over their heads and sees a group camping in the area.  Drag the mob over the group and hope it gets scraped off there.  After all who cares what happens to them right?<P>4) Getting begged for ports & sow.  I understand completely the frustration felt about ignorant people constantly asking for these.  As an anonymous high elf who often wanders around armed with a wraithbone hammer I know what its like to get sent tells from strangers asking for resses, and the verbal abuse that can follow when they realize that you're not a cleric.  I can only assume its worse for those who can res/port/sow.<P>5) Powerleveling...as long as you aren't smashing someone elses fun in the process then I don't mind this.  I don't do it/have it done to me personally, but there's nothing wrong with it so long as your still courteous to other folks around you.  Case in point.  I and some friends go down to lower guk live side.  We set up in the entry hall and our monk starts pulling.  We're there for an hour or so when a very powerful druid (red to the lot of us) zone's in with a pair of low (mid 20s I believe) friends, pulls five or ten mobs and proceeds to fight right on top of our group.  No warning, no explanation...just a big pull.  It struck me as rather rude.<P>All in all I haven't reassessed my feelings with regards to Druids.  I probably never will.  It's nice to see that there are more than a half dozen nice ones out there tho.<P>Shassiana Argentfox<BR>Freesword of Tunare<BR>Povar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=11&topic=000327.cgi&ReplyNum=000010&forum=General&TopicSubject=A+very+serious+question">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Rathir<P>I covered a few examples of the behavior I noticed in the above post.  If you would like to hear more of the same I would be happy to send you a private email on the subject, but the examples were there to illustrate a point so that a question could be asked.  As I said in my original post I'm not here to flame anyone.  I simply noted my experiences and my reaction to them so that those reading the post would have a clearer idea of what I was questioning.  I have recieved some very thoughtful and well written replys and if you noted, some of what was said I agreed with (especially the part about begging for resses, ports, buffs, money, gear...etc) but on the whole these posts have not and will not change my initial reaction to strange Druids that I meet.  I wonder why you feel the urge to sink to name calling in a civilised discussion, and I certainly will not start flaming anyone either individually or as a class.  I put forward my feelings and made points to illustrate them.<P>Shassiana Argentfox<BR>Freesword of Tunare<BR>Povar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=11&topic=000327.cgi&ReplyNum=000014&forum=General&TopicSubject=A+very+serious+question">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>It's a lot harder to come off as a nice person when you are already expecting them to be mean.  I like to use the justice system analysis to explain my point, which is innocent until proven guilty.  You seem to be using the guilty until proven innocent with people you meet from the druid class now.  You have to remember that the same person doesn't play all the druids you meet and not stereotype anyone.  Maybe that person is having a bad day, you never know.  All the bad traits you explained can be said about any class.<P>Let me tell you about my example.  Last night I decided to get in a group in the Dreadlands because I was bored with the kite-med routine.  I grouped wit a paladin, necro, and monk, all 48-51.  When I got into the group, the first thing they did was ask me if I could snare the mob.  I dont know who they grouped with before but after 47 levels I think I could figure out one of my main roles would be snaring!!.  The next issue was with the paladin.  I told him to come close so I coud use my mana efficient group regen and sow on them.  He said ok but proceeded to pull mobs anyway. I never got to cast them so I decided to just do chloro and sow.  Lo and behold, my sow didnt take on him.  I figured "ahh well, must have one from a higher druid".  About ten min later I see  "******* is surrounded by a brief lupine whatever".  I hadnt cast sow, no other people were around,  he used a frickin sow potion!!  I couldnt believe it.  Finally, to top it off, the necro was fearing before I hit my snared hotkey.  Mob would resist and away he went cause the necro started casting fear when I cast snare.  Will I hold this against all necros and pallies?  No way.  Granted, this is one example and you are speaking of 2 years, but I still won't hold the grudge.<P>    The grudge I hold is being seen as a person put in the game to move people around and give them sow.  That is really annoying; to the point where I dread seeing purple letters come up on my screen (tells).  Someone is always asking for something.  I have no problem giving any spell to anyone in my group or a sow for CR or something like that.  But when people are in BB and are Shouting for a TP to WC every 2 min, that is ridiculous.  I rode the boat before I could TP, everyone else can too.  With the amount of time people spend asking for TP, they could be where they need to go.  But they insist on standing there and annoying the whole zone.<P>I myself get a BIG kick out of seeing people's names.  It makes me mad when people want others to change their names "because they arent roleplaying".  Well, a lot of people play this game and they shouldnt have to conform because someone else doesnt believe the name is appropriate.  I can understand vulgar names but others are fun and should not be changed.  My name was Ninerienae Chillinontheflytip.   Not vulgar at all but without warning a GM came and took my last name at level 35. My current necro is going to have a similarly fun name. I truly hope you are not one of the ones that goes around petitioning names.  Nuff said about that.<P><BR>One last thing;  Why cant people rebel against their race?  Druids kiting dwarves is what I am talking about here. I am sure you have heard of the "unkempt druids"?  Rebels are everywhere  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">.<P>Ninerienae<BR>47 druid<BR>Nameless<P><BR>Bonemasta<BR>17 Necro<BR>Nameless</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=11&topic=000327.cgi&ReplyNum=000016&forum=General&TopicSubject=A+very+serious+question">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Greetings, all...<P>I've played Everquest for just about two years now, ever since the game appeared on store shelves. I don't have any really high level characters, for various reasons (time being one of the biggest) - but I have played a lot of different class/race combos, and I love the game.<P>I have played mostly on Erollisi Marr, Morell-Thule, and Brell Serilis. I'm a roleplayer, and I enjoy roleplay.<P>My "main" characters have been magicians and clerics. I don't like clerics too much and I absolutely love magicians. In fact, my main character, a Dark Elf mage, is on Erollisi Marr.<P>Recently I made a halfling druid to play in a guild of all 'little people' with some friends from work. It was either that or a gnome wizard (I wanted ports) and a friend suggested that a druid might be a better idea for both solo and group play. I think druids add a lot to groups, when played well. (And DAMN Harmony is a nice spell when taking on those orc and dervish camps in the North Ro area at level 12 or so!)<P>Having said that, my only opposition to playing a druid was the "bad name" they have. And then I thought about it. You know what? I've never had a bad experience with a druid! Ever!<P>EVERY time I've asked politely, I've gotten a buff or even a free port. The key here is asking politely, no, "sow plz" and schtuff.<P>I find I get a better response with, "Oh Great and Mighty Druid, could I ask you to please bestown upon me a Spirit of the Wolf that my feet might run with the grace of the wolves?"<P>At the very least, I have fun asking it that way.<P>And besides, I'm having fun with my little halfling druid... also on Erollisi Marr.<P>-Incandescent, Dark Elf Magician, Erollisi Marr<BR>-Catmint, Halfling Druid, Erollisi Marr<BR>-Sparko, Gnome Wizard, Erollisi Marr<BR>-Snapjaw, Iksar Monk, Erollisi Marr<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=11&topic=000327.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=General&TopicSubject=A+very+serious+question">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Again, I would like to thank everyone for their input on the subject at hand, and would like to adress some of the more recent posts, as well as clear up any misconceptions that any of you may have regarding my statements.<P>First.  Rathtr1, yes name calling.  Referring to someone as an "ignorant dude" is rude and uncalled for.  I feel that this thread has remained very open and dynamic as far as the responses and sharing of ideas contained within is concerned.  Never mind the fact that I happen to be a "dudette"  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>Second. Ninerienae, wow thats a long name, and I thought I was bad.  I understand your caution against finding someone guilty until proven innocent.  As I said in my original post it's a frustrating reaction to have.  Nay the less there it is.  I agree with you that any class has incompetent jerks in it.  Heaven knows I've met my fair share.  I originally started this post to seek some help understanding the split between the druids who are posting here (who seem on the whole to be fairly nice folk) and the druids that I have encountered in game (see my above posts for my feelings on them).  So far the feedback that I've recieved from the folks here has been very good and I greatly appreciate it.<BR>I also understand what you mean with your references to incompetent people.  There is never a bigger pain than to have a wizard run out of healing range with the mob aggroed on him, or to have an excitable puller who won't quit till you start yelling at him.  You sometimes have to wonder how these people got to where they are today.<BR>I've never reported anyone for having a silly or strange name.  The two I used in my example both struck me as being rather offensive.  The last time I recall petitioning anything was when I fell out of a tree in FV for 10k damage or something like that after a bad case of LD.<BR>And yes, I've heard of unkempt Druids, much like risen Shadowknights, Fallen Paladins, and good Dark Elves they do exist.  Being a Paladin and a follower of "Truth, Justice and the Felwithian way" so to speak, don't expect me to treat them with much kindness.  Sadly I sometimes feel I'm the only elf who feels this way tho.  I guess the eps and the levels are just too good to pass up for the sake of the background story and the role of the character.  <P>Which brings me to the following statement:<P>Quote by Incandescent<BR>I find I get a better response with, "Oh Great and Mighty Druid, could I ask you to please bestown upon me a Spirit of the Wolf that my feet might run with the grace of the wolves?"<P>If everyone who played spoke like this when they were playing I dont think I'd care if the druids never let me have another kill again.  <P><BR>At the very least, I have fun asking it that way.  And besides, I'm having fun with my little halfling druid... also on Erollisi Marr.<P><BR>And this...here's the whole point of the game right here.  Not loot, not eps, but fun.  Thank you Incandescent, you've made my night.  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>Shassiana Argentfox<BR>Freesword of Tunare<BR>Povar<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=11&topic=000327.cgi&ReplyNum=000019&forum=General&TopicSubject=A+very+serious+question">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I guess I did lose track of the original question  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">.  Here's my best attempt at that.<P><BR>For the most part, the people who post here I feel have a true love for the game.  Yes there are the whiners and babies and flamers but I think generally the people on these boards are here to help others.  The a**holes in game are not going to take the time to come post on a board like this unless it is to put someone down.  Even then I dont think they would take the time.  I have had my share of flames so far but only on the things I feel very strongly about and most of the time I try to keep it civilized.  I really like this game and enjoy sharing my experiences and answering questions to help others out.  I didnt start reading these boards till I was about 35 or so and it would have GREATLY helped if I had read them earlier.<P>I'm actually kind of afraid to walk into ANY paladin guild at all.  I'm a guy in RL and I made the mistake of creating a female wood elf druid as my first character.  I thought she looked pretty hot and apparently others do too(boy do I regret playing a female).  The thing that worries me about pallies is that I spent 4 levels vanquishing the freeport militia guards.  I can just see the pallies bombarding me with tells to marry them and such  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/tongue.gif">.  You can bet NONE of my other characters will be female again.  I dont know how you true females deal with the kind of crap that goes on in this game, but thats another topic entirely.  <P>   About the dwarfs in BB, you are right.  The exp is way to good to pass up.  No real faction hit(yet) and it is obscenely easy to do.  I am sure Verant will make faction matter eventually but as of right now it's pretty much worry free exp.<P><BR>Hope that helped clarify a little bit  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/tongue.gif">.<P><BR>Ninerienae<BR>47 druid<BR>Nameless<P><BR>Bonemasta<BR>17 Necro<BR>Nameless<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=11&topic=000327.cgi&ReplyNum=000020&forum=General&TopicSubject=A+very+serious+question">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

It goes "I trust my healer...I trust my healer..." -- silly, but it keeps me standing still until the heal goes off.  On pulling, though, as a puller (if I'm playing my monk or my ranger), my rule is I will pull until the group says stop.  Not until they have to yell at me (I was trained that well), but the monsters will keep coming until someone -- usually the casters -- tell me they need a break.<P>"I dont know how you true females deal with the kind of crap that goes on in this game, but thats another topic entirely."<P>Hmm...I am female, and only play female characters, three of which are Wood Elves and one is a Dark Elf.  I actually haven't had any problems with that kind of thing -- a couple people commented on the inky's pants when she was wearing leather (ever notice that female inkies in leather pants have holes in the butt?), but not offensively.<P>I, myself, dislike seeing guards and other static, inoffensive spawns camped -- there seems to be a whole theory of playing (necros do this even more than druids) which is nothing but a list of static, completely safe spawns; "camp this until you get to X level, then camp this other thing until Y level...".  This is particularly annoying when the NPC's being camped are either guards that someone might want to run to or quest NPC's that someone needs to talk to.  But that's just a pet peeve of mine...</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=11&topic=000327.cgi&ReplyNum=000021&forum=General&TopicSubject=A+very+serious+question">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I usually say "oh mighty on could you please bestow SoW on me to reduce my woe"? and it has never failed to get me a Sow either. Then while they are casting i zap them with Breeze.  Its best to trade zaps if at all possible. Yes, its nice to get something for nothing, but it's nicer to donate.  I actually sit in a newbie zone after leveling, and cast breeze strength shield etc... on newbies until my spell levels are maxed out again. They are so exciteable!
