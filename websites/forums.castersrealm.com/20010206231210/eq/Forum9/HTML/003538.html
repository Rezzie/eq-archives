</FONT><HR>Absor said he was going to reevaluate all classes and soon the enchanters will probably have their own thread too, to prevent having it filled with a lot of junk like the wizard one before it is closed why not make a nice summary of issues here and then paste that in the thread as soon as absor posts it?<P>After reading a few other posts about issues (which got polluted eventually) what about this list (I will edit it after the replies I guess to keep it up to date).<P>1) Velious inability to mez even with GoK and Rapture, GoK and Rapture should work way more often. Okay we understand the inability to mez with dazzle or lower, but GoK/Rapture was *already* balanced by the huge mana requirement, aggro (things summon you when it wears off and you die) and the recast time (only one mob). So we see no reason to make anything except the gods themselves immune to this if they meet the level requirement for the spell.<P>2) New illusions. Like evil eye for example self travel spell with sow built in, long cast time to prevent kiting. Gender or monster without faction benefits *just the illusion for looks* we dont use the faction benefits of spells except the racial illusions anyways.<P>3) Umbra AC is too low.<P>4) Wake of tranquility should be replaced by harmony (outdoor only).     <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif"> We dont need an AE suicide spell, the earlier lull spells could have been useful near a zone line, WoT is NOT. I dont think its overpowered to give a level 5? druid/ranger spell to a level 51 enchanter, if the spells should have done the same thing anyways. And I dont care if it doesnt work inside, those spells arent used inside anyways.<P>5) Religion should be able to be masked (temporarily agnostic) with a spell with an expensive component. Right now you are just stupid to choose other then agnostic.<P>6) Recast time of some spells like group werewolf is insane, we already have too few spell slots.<P>7) Enchanter equipment should focus WAY more on AC (and HP) we are hit often, so AC and HP are considered more important then int or cha or mana by a lot of people playing this class. Human/eru necros get flayed skin with good AC, but they dont need it. Enchanters would definitely like such high AC equipment.<P>8) Reoccurring amnesia, recant magic do not work as intended.<P>9) Racial illusions on PvP servers still drop when casting an offensive spell, please fix the bug and remove this 'temporary solution'.<P>10) PvP faction hits on coin only servers make enchanter quests impossible, please fix this.<P>Neferti<BR>Human illusionist<BR>Knights of the White Rose<BR>Tallon Zek<BR><p>[This message has been edited by neferti (edited January 24, 2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003538.cgi&ReplyNum=000000&forum=General&TopicSubject=Absor+enchanter+evaluation+-+post+suggestions+here">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>In general I would like to have the duration of the more commonly used buffs increased.<BR>it is extremely tedious to have to recast haste every 20 minutes on every tank, or clarity for that matter. I would even favor a mana cost increase proportional with the duration increase if necessary...I am sick of have to cast constantly to keep my group(s) buffed.<P>Specifically<BR>1) Group haste spell...so some people in my group dont need it..I dont care it will make my life easier in a tank heavy group.<P>2) Too many mez immune mobs. I am not talking about epic mobs. Mez is the PRIMARY tool of the enchanter to be proactive in a battle..without it we are relagated to the role of buff beocth. I can understand this for epic encounters..but there are literally dozens of mob types and 100s(1000) of spawn points in the game that our primary tool is useless against. Just think if these same mobs were immune to the necros dots or the mage's pets...boy would hear hear screaming then. No other class is so crippled against so many different kinds of mobs just because Verant decides that stun and mez are to be coded on the same flag. Its just laziness.<P>3)Boon of garu needs to have a longer duration or a shorter recast.<P>4)Make our pitiful dots stackable with all  the necro dots..It would be nice to at least a little damage during a long fight.<P>5)All of our spells are based on magic. This hampers us in PvP and PvE. If an opponent has a high MR we have NO other spells to turn to. Every other class has variety of spell types they can try to find the spell that thier opponent is vulnerable to. Enchanters have no such option.<P><BR>Thats all i have for now.<P>Tal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003538.cgi&ReplyNum=000001&forum=General&TopicSubject=Absor+enchanter+evaluation+-+post+suggestions+here">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Hmm..<P>1) Shamans and Clerics both get nice combined buffs to take away some of the extreme tedium of buffing repeatedly.  I'd like, at level 60, a haste + clarity 2 spell that lasts 2 hours.  Pretty much any mana cost would be acceptable... or change our epic's effect to something like that.   I'm tired of rebuffing every 20 minutes, I leveled my enchanter to 60, how about a break?<P>2) Lower the taunt on tashanian so I can cast it on high end NPCs without having to /wave goodbye to everyone first.<P>3) Fix the obviously broken spells like umbra.<P>4) How about an unresistable, or lure-style resisted AC or atk debuff, or very low (5%?) attack speed debuff.  Basicly something that might just effect a fight with a_velious_ubermob03.<P><BR>Also, why is recant magic broken?  Its the best dispell spell (+9 levels, 4 cancels), and has a shorter cast time then pillage.  Making it recur or something like some people think was intended would just make it useless since it would dispell debuffs and dots cast after it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003538.cgi&ReplyNum=000002&forum=General&TopicSubject=Absor+enchanter+evaluation+-+post+suggestions+here">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Change whirl and the upgrade to work like tishans clash and the upgrade or stun and holy might, from wizards and clerics spell line ups respectively.<P>Remove Sentinel.  Worthless after nerf just pisses people off.<BR>Remove Strength.  Why do we get this?<BR>Remove True North.  Useless?<BR>Remove Calm line.  Cant think of a time i would have to have this.<BR>Remove Shifting sight line.  Pointless.<BR>Remove Curse of simple mind.  Too resisted/useless.<BR>Remove invigor line.  Why do we get this anyway? It has nothing to do with our specalties.<P>Make our power over magic spells the same as wizards with the ability to overcome much higher resistances.  They have it for ice, magic, and fire.  Why cant I have it only for magic?  Its easily arguable that we control magical forces better than they do.  What would I sacrifice for this power?  My pet easily, and all the other spells I just mentioned, not to mention fear, all multiple target mez, all DOTS, all slows, all blurs.  I can make the knife go deeper.... all shifts.... all mana regen... Id give it all up for this power.... Make our spells able to hit something with 2MR per level.  At level 60 let me hit 120MR We are representatives of gods at lvl 60 my god would give me that power np but he is innorruk... Id even take 1.8MR per level or 1.7 per.<P>Blur - Make it work at high levels.<P>Give us another spell at level 56+ that removes ALL effects on any target like pillage used to do way back in the day.  Even if it doesnt remove disease/poison effects id still like to have the spell. <P>Reoccurring Amnesia - Make it reoccur.<P>Armor Sets - Design it for enchanters.  Give all the same type of resist instead of each one different.  Do this with all ENC sets.  Make hate all save vs fire.  Make kael all save vs cold etc.  This 10 of one stat for each thing doesnt mean jack.  Not to mention it seems like everything that saves vs poison just happens to be a foot slot item?  Whas up with that how am i supposed to get 100PR??<P>Give us Shadowstep or something else with the same effect.  So far Necros, Wizards, Bards, and Rogues have this spell, and Enchanters could possibly need it most.  Ok for Bards and Rogues its an item that just happens to come off "Tolapumj" which just happens to be an ENC mob.  The ENC mobs get items with shadowstep.... gee let me think about this.... cant say they dont give it to some enchanters then....<P>Just my thoughts...<P>Tsunamii Val'Sharess<P><BR><p>[This message has been edited by Tsunamii Starshine (edited January 24, 2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003538.cgi&ReplyNum=000005&forum=General&TopicSubject=Absor+enchanter+evaluation+-+post+suggestions+here">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Tsunamii, I don't want them to take away any spells, regardless if someone sees them as "useless." I actually used Sentinel last night quite effectively and I love the Cast Sight series (don't many chanters clamour for "fun" spells?). Also, I don't see why we should get an equivalent to Shadow Step. Sure, it'd be great, but I don't understand why we should get one.<P>I don't think that they should reduce the casting time on Boon of the Garou. Powerful spell, targetable illusion (<I>with</I> beneficial effects!)...isn't this what we wanted? I'm in the mindset to not complain about this spell else VI may take it away   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/tongue.gif">.<P>I don't believe there should be group haste spells. This would take way too much time and mana to cast, and you know the duration would be decreased if they did come out with a spell. Basically VI would make it more worthwhile to cast single haste on 2 players instead of group haste on 6.<P><I>How about an unresistable, or lure-style resisted AC or atk debuff, or very low (5%?) attack speed debuff. Basicly something that might just effect a fight with a_velious_ubermob03.</I><P>Isn't this exactly what the necros were complaining about? Playing an active role in epic encounters? While I, too, would like to be able to engage an uber mob more, I don't think this is likely.<BR>On to suggestions...<P><B>Illusions should mask religions!!</B><P>There is no reason NPCs should see through our excellent diguise and into our hearts, nor is there a possible RP way of looking at it. This has caused many unneeded deaths to those that trust their illusions the first time they walk into a dangerous city.<P><B>WTYH Line</B><P>I wonder what these spells were like in the mythical prenerf days. Bring back some of the usefulness of this spell. Perhaps make it like a cleric's stun? (And I never understood why they get targeted stuns)<P><B>Umbra AC</B><P>The AC on this spell needs to be looked at. There's no reason for an upgrade in a spell line to grant the same (or just an infentessimal increase) benefits for more mana/casting time.<P><B>Armor Sets</B><P>Should be looked at somewhat as well. I'd like to have more variety, as would others, with ENC only armor with nice resists, and something other than CHA. HP and AC items would be lovely (since we're one of the lowest HP having classes out there, aren't we?).<P><B>Group Clarity</B><P>I, too, would like to see this moved down a few levels. Why have this at a level where you get C2 in a few more? Perhaps move it to 49/50?<P><B>STR Debuffs</B><P>It would be nice to see an effect when you load up the STR debuffs like when you slow a mob. Perhaps there is a difference, perhaps not. I haven't done any empirical research to see one way or another. Cast Insipid Weakness on a mob and he's still hitting for XX amount of damage. /shrug<P><B>Rune IV vs V</B><P>Exactly why is the component for both of these spells peridots? I would love to see the reagent for Rune IV moved down a gem, but if we clamour about this maybe Rune V will have it's reagent moved up a gem?<P><B>Misc</B><BR>Is there really a problem with mez and Velious mobs? I haven't noticed, but then, I haven't hunted there much. If so, then this should be addressed.<P>Reoccuring Amnesia... I've heard this doesn't reoccur (I don't have the spell).

</FONT><HR>Focus our attention on class balance.  That is what Absor continues to say.<P>1) The higher the level an enchanter attains, the more time and mana we spend on buffing. This is very boring.  Help us out by making our higher level buffs last longer.<P>2) More mobs should be affected by GoK and Rapture.  We are masters of crowd control, but Velious is extremely unfriendly to enchanters.<P>3) Target illusion at lvl 60.  Since it would have no global requirements, and is somewhat similar to Magician monster summoning, it should not be that difficult to implement.<P>4) Lower Tash taunt factor.  Against very high level mobs, casting this spell is almost certain death for the enchanter.<P>5) Enchanters need access to higher AC equipment.  We get beat on more than any caster class and our survival is often necessary for group survival.<P>6) Increase XP bonus for enchanters.  We are attacked more than any but tanks, have low AC, therefore die more.  An increase in XP would compensate for our increased fatality rate.<P>Morphius - Bequiler - Erollisi Marr</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003538.cgi&ReplyNum=000014&forum=General&TopicSubject=Absor+enchanter+evaluation+-+post+suggestions+here">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>A bit choppy because I'm replying to previous statements first... bear with me.<P>First, I don't think there is much of an issue in Velious. The only thing I find silly is small mobs that are giant flagged, such as in PoG. But that's just a matter of learning what is and isn't mezzable. The MR issues have been fixed by and large. If you doubt, go check zones yourself. There is another issue in zones where EVERYTHING is too high to charm and is giant flagged as well. That should be looked into.<P>Don't ask for things like SOW or Harmony. We're not going to get them. And while the explanation was worded poorly, I agree with the intent behind them. Want SOW? Bribe a caster or buy a potion. Leave Harmony to the druids and rangers. Realize that the entire Lull line has always been useless, and "fixing" it would make the game trivial.<P>If you want to mask your religion, you give me a way to change my religion. Sorry, you make the choice at the start and being a non-agnostic ench isn't foolish as they continue to implement religion only items. I expect the agnostic community to whine about the PoG quest item whenever it's completed. I'm agnostic, but I made that choice at the start and I'll take the disadvantages as well as the advantages. The inverse should be true as well.<P>Recast on garou is correct people. We're not supposed to do more than 2 at once. You could ask for a 30 min duration and a 15 min recast, but then you have to wait 15 minutes after memming it to cast it the first time.<P>Reoccuring amnesia is broken, or should at least be a harder single target blur. Recant magic is not broken and was improperly described at first (the message given by the spell is also poor). Recant magic is our best dispell, costing only slightly more than pillage and dispelling better with a faster cast time.<P>I don't do PvP teams, etc. but I sympathize with you. I always thought the illusion drop was a lame fix to a weird bug.<P>DOT stacking should be fixed. I suspect they'll say we should charm if something is MR, but too often that's not an option because everything nearby is MR or there is nothing nearby. I may just be hitting a stylistic barrier here though since I've never favored charm. I agree that tash is WAY too high of an aggro. I don't understand why mala is unresistable, nearly no aggro, AND it does far more than tash. Common tactic is to mala to get resists down and then malo. And chaining those two massive debuffs doesn't get the mage or shaman torn apart like a single tash or a slow (from either ench or shaman) does.<P>True north is a divination trainer. Strength is the start of our berserker line, kinda. Shifting sight line is the bind sight series. Occasionally useful. I don't know why we didn't get any upgrades in Kunark or Velious as we should have. Curse of simple mind is occasionally useful in PvP, but barely. Ditto Torment of Argli.<P>Umbra is broken. Raloon's idea for a C2 + haste buff that lasts for a long time is a good one. Can we wrap GRM into it too?  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  Thing is, if it's not better/as good as than Shissar I won't use it. If it is better than Shissar I'll be annoyed about it. Fun! But anything that makes me have to buff less every 30 mins or so is good. Change group C1 and C2 to be long lasting versions maybe (up the mana costs).<P>The Gift series of spells cost too much mana. Especially when compared to the druid mask lines and PotG. Cut the costs by 1/3 to 1/2 to make it more reasonable (100/200/300 or 75/150/225). Or make it a group buff for the current amount of mana. The main advantage of these spells is the added regen. The +mana pool is a joke.<P>Enchanters should get Improved Invis vs Undead at 60. We get the regular one appreciably later than necro/cleric, and it'd just be a nice (but not heavily useful) spell to have. Similarly, I don't know why we didn't get Invert Gravity. We get Gravity Flux 10 levels before wizards do, but never get the upgrade (yes, another toy spell at best).<P>Item issues - agree big time on the AC/HP issue. Where is the flayed skin equivalent for non-necros? The Velious pants take 15 seconds to cast C1. This should either be C2 for that time or C1 for 7 seconds (same casting time as the Rod of Infinite Thought from Innoruuk -- it's a reasonable casting time and is useful for jumpstarting mana after death or buffing lower levels). <P>The Velious robe effect is useless as is. I can cast rune4 with mana and med it back up in nearly the same amount of time. It needs to be changed to a much lower casting time and no component (R4 has the same component issue clerics have with Naltron's) or R5 with a slightly lower casting time and using peridot. I see no reason we have to spend 10.5 plat and stand still 25 seconds for a 400 pt damage shield when clerics get a 2400 pt heal DOT (their L59 spell!) for 20 seconds of standing and no component.<P>The VP robe should also have its effect changed. The DOT is just worthless. Put GRM on the robe and make me happy, one less buff to mem. Is it coincidence that the only robe effect considered useful from VP is the necro DMF robe?<P>Think I forgot some things, but that'll do for now.<P>------------------<BR>Llarn &lt;Prophecy&gt;<BR>L59 Enchanter, Bertoxxulous</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003538.cgi&ReplyNum=000015&forum=General&TopicSubject=Absor+enchanter+evaluation+-+post+suggestions+here">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Some GREAT ideas here guys  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">! Keep the ideas coming - I don't think there is a class that works together better or harder than we Enchanters.<P>Group Effectiveness<BR>Alot has been said already about the insane MR of many of the higher level (and not so high level) MoBs but if there is one issue I feel strongest about and that we could change it would be this one! If we can't mez, charm or stop a MoB in any way what good are we in the encounter? And stop with the "you can root them" we aren't Wizards and we don't want to be Wizards. I am sure that like most of you, the main reason we enjoyed being Enchanters so much was being able to control the flow of battle, to be in the thick of things, rising to the challenge of keeping MoBs under control until the group could deal with them. Taking this away from us or even the chance of it, is like benching the star quarterback during the Super Bowl and putting in the kicker to score points! No way is any Enchanter who has leveled his character thru the hell of post 50s levels going to be happy with merely providing buffs at high levels! LET US DO OUR JOBS - THANK YOU VERANT.<P>Obviously somethng has to be done. I don't have alot of the technical background of game mechanics that some of you have. But I would like to see something like our Tash debuff increased in effectiveness (and not make it such a taunt damn it  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">). Or make some of our higher level spells like Kintaz or Rapture do what they say they are supposed to do. Do you know how many times I have had a *rarely resisted* spell resisted??? You would think for the mana expenditure that they would actually STICK more often! Level difference should matter more - NO WAY should a green or low blue con EVER resist my mez! Okies I admit I am ranting, but something has to be done.<P>Buffing<BR>I am particularily in favor of the suggestions about shortening the rigors of buffing. I love the group cast spells, gets everyone done at once and I could see that if we had more of these it would be ever so much easier to stagger your buffing routines while helping you to better manage your mana expenditures.<P>Boon is a nice spell but it should last longer, what is up with 3 mins anyways? Keep the recast time the same and make it last 12 mins. How many times is a high level group going to have more than 3 tanks anyways?<P>I had heard that they increased the duration of the spell that our Epic casted. I haven't gotten mine yet (I am really close though) but was this increased? Perhaps we ought to include a point about this, 12 mins ought to be 20 minimum - this baby is too hard to get to just have you using it and doing nothing else.<P>Game Mechanics<BR>I really liked the idea about some mechanism or better control on targeting. The current system needs some tweaking. It would be nice to be able to cycle through a stack of identical MOBs and see "you have mezed a Froglok_01" and "you have mezed a Froglok_03" ect. Or even when your tank has targeted a "Froglok_07" at least some way of knowing which one everyone is on more quickly. <P>Only other gripe on targeting is how many times have you had a MoB targeted and started to cast and someone cast on you (like a Bard's song) and your target is switched before you can complete casting? Once you target something it shouldn't switch automatically.<P>Another game mechanic thing is on the bard class. Playing with Bards can really be annoying because their songs always overwrite or screw up our spells. You have to ask them to stop mana song to cast clarity, you have to be careful when traveling with them over hilly terrain if you are in Air Ele form and they are using Lev song. Ever ran across the DL from the Ice Tunnel to KC and while in Air Ele form and had the Bard run out of range from you? The next step is a dozie. <P>Class Defining Abilities<BR>Nothing has been said as yet about our ability to enchant items. One of the main reasons I first because an Enchanter was that we were promised that one day we would be able to enchant objects. This has never happened. Maybe it would make us too over balanced if they gave us the ability to enchant weapons or armor and make them have have uber stats but what about the ability to recharge certain items? Maybe we have to use a component (like the mana batteries in Sky - what are those things used for anyway?). Anything like this would be nice.<P>More illusions would be nice, and I think we got screwed when they gave all the new illusions to Necros, Shamans and Druids but what the heck, if they would just fix Mez and put us back in the game at higher levels I would be a happy camper!<P>Baltazor Goldsinger<BR>56 Enchanter Fennin Ro<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003538.cgi&ReplyNum=000016&forum=General&TopicSubject=Absor+enchanter+evaluation+-+post+suggestions+here">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>After reading through Alan's responses to Wizzies and Clerics I just thought I would point out to people that they are not interested in any new spells, just in fixing/balancing the ones we have as well as balancing the class in general. Also they want the reasoning behind a request, not just the request. If we are going to have a serious, useful thread here it would be good to try and stick to those guidelines.<P>Having said that however,  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/wink.gif"> a group Augment at 44 or 49 WOULD be nice. Individual Tanks can then get Celerity, SLTW etc on request which overwrites Augment anyway.  OK, I'll stop the new spells bit now. <P><BR>Mez: Seems like there are an awful lot more mez immune mobs these days, especially in Velious.  If Verant thinks Mez is too powerful and keeps it this way then the next point becomes even more important.<P>Charm: PLEASE tweak the Charm series.  It's really boring just being a buffer in the big encounters.  Having a more reliable Charm would at least mean I could more frequently consider using one of my class defining abilities in those fights... as a possible option anyway.<P>I guess I'm really asking for is a lot less chance of it breaking here.  I've lost count of the times a charm has broken almost before my spell icon has even refreshed   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  (heheh, maybe not quite that quick but not far off) <P>From the earliest Charm would be nice but maybe from Beguile/Cajolling Whispers onwards would make a little more sense?  Faster casting times too please if we can't mez or stun stuff when charm breaks.<P>Changing the name colour of a charmed pet or prefixing it with the Enchanter's name would be would be a big help too thanks   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  <P>Resist Rates:  All of our spells are magic based (fair enough). We get a MR debuff spell (hooray but ouch sometimes). I tend to think we are the masters of magic.  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif">  However, nearly all of our spells have a fairly big resist penalty on them (boo).  <P>It just seems like we get given something with one hand and then it's taken away with the other.  I know Tash helps all casters in a fight but we do tend to get alot more resists than any other class. On damage spells I have no problem with the resists but any chance of lowering the resist penalty on our class stuff like Stuns, Mezzes and Charms?   <P>Wake of Tranquility:  Yep it's rubbish and should be renamed just Wake as that's what you'll be holding for the party if you rely on it actually working.  Needs rethinking otherwise it stays on page forty something.<P>Boon of the Garou:  I'm sure when Verant create spells they would like them to be used so please either decrease the recast time or increase it's duration so we can keep it up on 3 tanks partially or 2 tanks very easily. Otherwise, it's just not worth a spell slot.<P>Decrease it's DEX bonus to 100 and increase the Lifetap to around 50 to ease the burden on the healers.  If this can't be done then at least fix the proccing bug when the player's DEX hits 255.<P>Werewolves are widely asociated with  Enchanters and I guess weirdly enough it is our class defining illusion/creature (it's also in the Global file) so would be nice to see this used more.<P>Mem Blur Line:  After around level 30 they start becomming so unreliable that by level 51 I'm having to cast 4 or 5 times sometimes before having the desired effect.  If you can't clear the Wizzy or Cleric from a mobs hate list pretty quick then what's the point of memming the spell?  In the early levels it used to be a real emergency lifesaver and I still can't see the harm in that? It rarely serves that purpose anymore.  The spell line needs changing back to their pre 30's mob effectiveness.<P>Illusions:  Contentious subject this I know.  Personally I would rather they fixed and/or enhanced the ones we already have than spent time creating new ones.  Make Skelly faction not KOS to undead for example and tweak a few of the other existing illusion's abilities so they are used a little more often to create some variety.<P>OK, so a chair is always going to be a chair   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> but maybe increasing the swimming speed of the water elemental illusion or giving the fire elemental a decent fire resist and damage shield that increases with level would see them used more often?  Hmm... I've gone way off topic here haven't I   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"> sorry.<P>Illusions should stay up when you zone.<P>Group Clarity:  Level 52 is too high and close to C2.  We get Clarity at 29 and Clarity 2 at 54.  Make Group Clarity around 44 or 49 and take some of the tedium out of buffing.  Give it a longer duration than Clarity also.<P><BR>Rune IV:  Never really understood why it was such a huge leap in gem cost for this spell compared to Rune III.<P>Amber or Jade would make a much more logical choice of component and although they are less than half the price of peridots I can almost gaurantee that more money would leave the player economy if this was implemented.<P>Bodge <P>51st Enchanter<P>E Marr<P><BR>Bodge <P><BR> <p>[This message has been edited by Bodge27 (edited January 24, 2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003538.cgi&ReplyNum=000018&forum=General&TopicSubject=Absor+enchanter+evaluation+-+post+suggestions+here">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>My thoughts..<P>I think that we enchanters are the most powerful class in the game bar none.  No one gets pets like we do, no one can control a large interaction like we do.  We're needed to varying degrees by every form of group in Norrath, and we can (though tediously imho) solo to boot if we're really bored.<P>This becomes to me a wishlist, but there are a couple things I'd like to be sure we put on the list for class ballance.  I think it's important to remind Absor as well that Enchanters take almost all of our power from the environment around us, from augmenting our group members to controlling NPCs the pinacle of our power comes from those around us. Thus to look at ballancing the Enchanter class is to look not only at us, but at the classes and environ around us.<P>In no particular order, enchancements I'd like to see done to the class:<P>a) Give warriors an AE taunt at some point.  "Battle Yell" or whatever to boost them on the aggro list of that stack of Golems you've just fascinated.  Strangly I think giving them a non-damaging way to AE aggro would help us immeasurably.<P>b)  Faster, (mini) healing spells for Druid and Shamen is a good thing.  I don't intend on replacing a Cleric with a shaman, but I'd like a shaman or druid to be more able to heal me when 2/4 Ilis Knights just resisted AE Mes.  (or the hasted bok knight resisted a stun)<P>Giving ablities to other classses can make me more powerful  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/smile.gif"><P>I agree that the number of strangely flagged monsters in Velious can be a problem.  I don't care particularily about Kael - city of giants - I never expected to Mes em.  But the Royal Dorfs in Icewell?  50% of the things in PoG?  The odd rock golem in the hole?<P>I think we all recognize that an enchanters ability to Mesmerize things is a ballance issue across all classes.  When VI wants an "Epic" encounter to get harder, they turn off mes.  Makes sense - it's the easiest thing to be sure that everything is that much harder.  I don't expect to be conpensated for tying one hand behind me back, though I do like to know that it was for a good reason.<P>The only thing I have that I'd like to see adjusted in our spells is Duration of Buffs.<P>Some last ok, but I'd like to see the duration doubled if not tripled.  Buffing is a pain.  Buffing is not fun.  Given that every caster is going to have clarity, and every tank is going to have haste from us, I would love to have to cast it less often.  <P><BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003538.cgi&ReplyNum=000021&forum=General&TopicSubject=Absor+enchanter+evaluation+-+post+suggestions+here">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>My views on the matter :<P>- Class balancing wise, enchanters are the most difficult for VI to handle. Give us too many and its the whole game which gets unbalanced. As our main power lies in making the group we're in far more effective. Thus I strongly disagree with some above requests (like group clar at 44 or even 49). On the other hand, not changing a wiff leads to far too resentment as some of our lines are really ludicrous (like the lull line or WTYH which I sincerely think none of us are using, except for fun purpose). The challenge of our class is fine tuning the ability against the difficulty of properly playing our class (one of the reason why we're so few). <P><BR>Any and all change done to our class has a lot of  influence on other. Some of our ability may need fine tuning, Velious show VI has many tricks at hand to cut some of our abilities (even if consistency is not their strong point, eg Icewell coldain being giant flagged). Some spells we can get rid of under their current form (see above) or VI can try again to make them work as they were supposed to be.    <P>- Some illus would be nice to add (illus gender being my pet peeve   <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/tongue.gif">). They close to change nothing to core game. In truth I can settle with that if VI decides to "balance" others the same way. ie, no class envy nor try to be uber-class.<P>It may well be possible, VI won't change us. Not that I would like that much, but I would see some reason for that.   <P><BR>best,<BR>Ibn<BR><p>[This message has been edited by Ibn (edited January 24, 2001).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003538.cgi&ReplyNum=000022&forum=General&TopicSubject=Absor+enchanter+evaluation+-+post+suggestions+here">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>Very few of the posts here are about balancing enchanters (either balance vs other classes or balance vs environment).  Rather they're about things we'd like to see fixed or improved... things we don't want to be forgotten before the big freeze.  That's good too, but let's try to distinguish between those two issues.  My list includes most of the ideas from this thread, as well as my own.<P>Enchanters are, on the whole, pretty well balanced, and are even in demand for groups (but not so much at lower levels).  But remember... enchanters die more often than any other class and level slower than most.  Don't go thinking everything's just fine.  Still... almost all of the changes suggested are to make things more convenient, not to make enchanters more powerful in any real sense.<P><BR>Five actual balance issues:<P>The Tashania line should have less taunt and more effect.  Unnerf these spells enough so that enchanters can reduce MR more than shamans.  Compare both the taunt and the effect to the shaman spells... I dare ya.  This has special importance on PvP servers.<P>Too many high level creatures(53+) are immune to charm and mez, especially in Velious.<P>Our pet spells at 34 and 39 are too weak.  The pets at other levels may or may not be balanced, but these two are worse than the rest.<P>The ability to both give and take mana from groupmates.  It seems like some class ought to be able to 'heal' mana in the same sense that clerics heal health.  Currently necromancers do that better than enchanters... just seems wrong.<P>Enchanters need armor with more AC (and HP).  We need it more than necros need flayed skin armor (and certain other items with AC tuned to shadowknights but still usable by necros).<P><BR>Four spell lines that suck:<P>Lull line. It may have been too powerful in beta, but it's too weak now. Enchanters, being the only class with an uncommandable pet, will find pulling almost impossible unless they play without their pet. So an enchanter already has to make a tradeoff to even use these spells. Perhaps that gives you a little leeway to make these spells more useful, without considering it unbalancing?<P>Whirl/Dyn's/Largarn's. Once upon a time (long ago) these were found to be overpowered. So they were made essentially useless. Isn't there anything in between? Maybe you could replace these with the cleric's line of stun spells.  Clerics actually complain about their stuns, but it'd still be better than this line of spells.<P>Taper Enchantment. Not the whole line, just this one particular spell. Its only purpose it to confuse the young enchanters. Don't improve it, don't fix it, don't replace it, just delete it from the game. Please.<P>Weakness spell lines. They just aren't powerful enough. When we talk about stat buffs and debuffs we always end up talking about shamans more than enchanters, and that's only proper. But still... these spells are too weak as is. Languid Pace and the other attack-slowing spells are so much better.<P><BR>Two things still missing:<P>The ability to create (and perhaps recharge) magic weapons and armor and wands and such.<P>More illusions. Many ideas on this... I'd particularly like to be able to choose which face I get (and perhaps what type of armor I seem to have) when I illusion to one of the player races.<P><BR>Twelve things that just don't work quite right:<P>Higher level mez spells should overwrite the lower level mesmerizes (especially the AE mesmerization).<P>Illusion spells shouldn't fade on linkdeath.  I know it's a longshot, but maybe the fix to the delayed-faction-when-zoning bug will open an opportunity to fix this too.<P>Charm spells should have a minimum duration. This one little change might transform charm from a soloing spell to a grouping spell.  Really consider this.<P>Make charm more group-friendly 2:  Not to make the spell more powerful per se, just a little more convenient.  How many seconds does a pet class have to wait after issuing /pet back off before he can issue the next /pet attack command? It should take just as long for a charmed mob to get its bearings when charm wears off.<P>Make charm more group-friendly 3: A visible indication that a mob is charmed... perhaps the name above its head should change to a different color.<P>Yet another charm change: There should be a /pet command that ends the charm, so we can stop casting invisibility on ourselves to<BR>break charms.<P>Reoccuring Amnesia spell: Doesn't reoccur.<P>Tiny daggers still aren't sold at the magic guild(s) in Qeynos.<P>It's too hard to target particular creatures when there are several crowded together.  We need more targeting features.  For a start, perhaps you could show the _01 number at the end of a mob name so we know which one we're aimed it.  This actually is an enchanter issue... everyone else can use /assist.<P>Religion faction adjustment can never be hidden, not even by illusion.  Seems like it should be possible... then maybe enchanters wouldn't have to be 99% agnostic.<P>Faction hits on some PvP servers make certain very important enchanter quests impossible... fix the quests.<P>On PvP servers illusions drop when casting an offensive spell.  Fix the bug and remove this 'temporary solution'.<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003538.cgi&ReplyNum=000023&forum=General&TopicSubject=Absor+enchanter+evaluation+-+post+suggestions+here">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Anything that I would have brought up is pretty much here.  In short:<BR>Mez and stun rates<BR>Resistance rates on boss mobs<BR>WTYH (fix is to some degree)<BR>Lull line (Im sorry but it is along class lines and not that powerful - it is useless now)<BR>Blur rates<BR>Group clarity and Group speed buffs would be nice.<BR>These are all class elements that fall apart at some level or another.<P>Besides that I think one more spell would be extremely helpful, and in my opinion along class lines - Feign Death.<BR>As an enchanter we imitate other races and mobs, is it that far off to imitate being dead?  I know SK and Nec have it, but I think we should too.  It would reduce alot of the issues of taunt factor and high fatality rate in one effect that is consistent with our class (no need for shadowstep).<P>Id like someone elses opinion about the Feign Death idea.  Ive never heard anyone mention it, but to me it sounds like a good solution to many of our problems.<BR>Mal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=9&topic=003538.cgi&ReplyNum=000024&forum=General&TopicSubject=Absor+enchanter+evaluation+-+post+suggestions+here">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 4 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum9/HTML/003538-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum9/HTML/003538-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum9/HTML/003538-3.html">3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum9/HTML/003538-4.html">4</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum9&number=9&thisthread=003538&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum9&number=9&thisthread=003538&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
