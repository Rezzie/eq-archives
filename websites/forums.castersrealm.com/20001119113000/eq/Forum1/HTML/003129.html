</FONT><HR>I do have to admit I am confused as to why Verant would do this.<P>I was actually running through Qeynos Hills having come from WK on my way to hop the boat for Erudin to pick up Illusion Werewolf (44 enchanter illusion for you non-enchanters).  Anyhow as I ran by the Qeynos wall I noticed this new tent and campfire that had never been there before that I can recall (though I haven't been near Qeynos in a few months).<P>There was this NPC monk called A Rude Individual there.  He conned green to me.  As I approached he aggroed on me and ran over from like 50 feet away and started attempting to hit me.  He must be *very* low green, as he had a hard time even scratching me, and I didn't even have all my own buffs up since I was traveling.  I don't know exactly what lvl he was, but I will tell you he dropped with one Discordant Mind (508 pts at lvl 44), which I casted the whole time he was hitting me without being interupted (6.1 second casting time.  I lost no factions and I don't recall him having any loot.<P>The thing is he aggroed on someone as many as 25 levels above him from a fairly large distance away.  Why?  He could probably take out newbies, or at least force them to zone.<P>------------------<BR>Parm Vomgrossenhirn of Karana</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003129.cgi&ReplyNum=000003&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Why|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I already have been smacked by the level 55 bandit in WK --- T Grifton? --- then just today I ran by the loathsome ones in Q Hills and there were wall to wall bodies from the hut, around the hut, all the way to the entrance to BB.  Someone was doing a shout for help pulling a friend's body, and I thought to help...<P>Shortly thereafter my level 40 monk had to zone from a yellow caster and another blue warrior one that hit WAY too hard in my opinion.  I zoned into BB and you should have seen the mixture of naked and fully armored players cowering at the zone entrance.  No one was straining at the leash to zone back over there.  I just camped - screw that - Verant is nuts.<P>Sand Giants are aggro but don't see for crap. Can't compare the two situations.

</FONT><HR>In addition, SG's don't come down to the beach unless pulled there.  Low levels can hunt in relative peace on the beach.  <P>Griffins are certainly a hazard in EC, but no more than two exist at a time, they fly slowly, and and have a small aggro range.<P>HGs in WK wander, but there are safe areas.<P>Level 6's should be able to reach a dungeon without being killed.  Level 40 monks should not have to camp in a low level dungeon because they can't zone out of it without being killed.<P>Verant made a mistake.  A bad one.  Now we have to wait and see how long it will be before they admit it.  Or perhaps their intention is to provide another place for a full group of level 50's to camp?

</FONT><HR>I have to quote Abashi and he is right "there are no newbie zones!". Well I am a roleplayer and I like storyline. Due to a storyline it makes actually sense that some Highlevel Mobs, maybe planning an invasion, are around the cities. It makes sense for SGs to be in Oasis, maybe they want a sip of water too?<BR>And I dont know what you folks are whining about. If you are careful and watch out, you can minimize the danger. I was once killed by a griffin, but that was trained into me without warning. I was NEVER killed by a SG (as a newbie hehe, died while fighting one), that was simply because we had someone stand watch while the group was medding at Orc Valley.<BR>Well to sum it up:<BR>It is good for the story for that creatures to be where they are and with a little effort you can minimize the danger to nearly non existant.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003129.cgi&ReplyNum=000009&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Why|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I want to chime in here since this is one of my peeves about this game.  While I do tend to like the possibility of that random higher level mob cleaning house on a zone sort of like D'vinn back in the days when Crushbone was a high level area (early 1999), I do find it utterly ignorant that these mobs which are inherently evil or "loathsome" are not loathed by guards.  Further, I would like to pitch my complaint here regarding the Stupidity of making Roror, a level 49ish lizardman shaman in Feerott a major agro mob.  He can singlehandedly take out any three level 45s Easily.  I watched him kill two level 50s in 45 seconds or so.  It was a joke.<P>Feerott was great to hang out in for levels 35-45 doing spectres and using the druid ring.  Now they have ruined this zone by having that bastard instakill anything under level 40.  The tree spectre was a great lone spawn for those of us that do need to play solo on occassion due to time constraints or boredom in dungeon groups.  Now that entire zone is just an unused zone entrance for Fear and Cazic.  Why after one year of roaming the zone harmlessly would this shaman decide to attack everything in sight?  Talk about RP nonsense.  I can understand the need for dynamics, but why not have this kind of crap go in in the higher level areas.  Too many new players are turned off or frustrated too much by this whimsical change of faction, hp, level, etc... that Verant imposes as a cure to some players finding a nice way to earn exp in a relatively safe low risk environment.<P>This comes back to their VISION of what MY idea of fun and challenging truly is.  To be forced into the madening lines of camping dungeons and rare spawns, and to have ALL soloable areas destroyed at discovery is in direct contrary to their mentality of exploring their stupid little world.  Just when you invest the hours into finding that nice little niche to play within, they find you there and ruin it with some half arse reason of balance and exploit.<P>The problem is this:  EQ has gotten to be too small.  Granted there are over 50 or so zones, half of which are cities or useless to gaining exp once you hit level 5, but when you account for the 1800 or so peak players all fighting to get into only 12 of these useful zones, why haven't they realized that the trouble isn't in having too many low level safe areas, but rather not enough mid-high level NEW areas.  Are you telling me that the goblins in HighKeep have been holding those same three rooms under the keep for years now, and we have not killed them off yet?  Why haven't they dug in deeper?  Why haven't them pesky Hill Giants learned by now that it is better to travel in groups or pairs?!  The situation is such that Verant should decide to truly offer us dynamics and change at all levels, or leave things as they are so that once we get set in our mindless holding patterns, they dont toss a few curves once a year that causes us to lose levels, time and fun.  Roror killing me now is not my idea of a fresh angle in the game.  It seems to me to be a glitch or programmer error in his faction all of a sudden.  There are no story lines, there are no roleplaying sensical moves.  This game has stagnated and each of us needs to decide if he wants to continue to support it, or quit MMPORPGs until a new one that offers a new challenge other than camp kill die level lose level level, camp kill die level lose level level, etc...<P>I for one am liking the fast pace violence of Quake3.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003129.cgi&ReplyNum=000011&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Why|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Wow you all are major pack of whining losers. <P>First off the aggro radius on the rudes and now the loathesomes is not that high - you can easily zone in and out around them without danger. <P>2nd - they are not miscons - what have you people been smoking? They fight at exactly the level you'd expect - maybe easier. The certainly don't hit any harder than an equivalent level mob in kunark. Also, they don't seem to go much higher than mid 30s - certainly none of the dozens I have killed have been 40th+. <P>Lastly - Its a great freaking idea and I hope they do more of it! Zones are supposed to CHANGE - if people actually spent more time paying attention to what was going on and less reading spoiler sites and looking at the map they printed out....for those twerps who hadn't noticed there are bandits in the gorge in EK now - they are doing a good job of killing off low levels running through as well....<P>Ahh well all you whining losers will probably get your way and verant will cave in.....but I sure hope not....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003129.cgi&ReplyNum=000012&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Why|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

(and BTW I played my chars from the ground up with no help from anyone -- messing with the loathesomes and trying to figure out the story is a nice break from organizing/going on all those dragon/nasty dungeon raids...and I am not even in a guild..so you're right -I must have no friends)<P>Summary: <BR>   Loathesomes spawn in fixed locations<P>   Their aggro radius is small enough that you can cast on them from outside it<P>   The do not block access to any exits from the zone<P>   They cannot outrun SoW or 'celos and in several dozen fights have never been observed to cast root/snare or equivalent<P>    Like most newer mobs - they don't pursue if you out distance them<P>    The uber tough ones only spawn if you are killing off the weak ones and despawn in approximately one minute if not engaged - so they don't lurk for unsuspecting chars<P>     And lastly - anyone else notice the number of fine steel weapons, minor magic weapons and bronze/ringmail that is being dropped? And how much of this is ending up in the hands of relatively low level characters? This is an awesome new spawn that challenges and threatens low-mid level characters in the qeynos area to reach above themselves. The simple reason so many chars are dying to them is how good the loot is for the level - it is a great bait and sucker trap and I love it...heheh<P>and oh yeah Caleb - people like me don't need to hide - because most people like us -unlike those who are constantly whining about the lastest "nerf" "insult" "mess-up" or whatever we're too busy playing and having fun to care....<P>as for my crack at spoiler sites - it was badly worded - I don't care what spoiler sites you want to read, just don't take it as gospel and assume it is right..or suddenly get all indignant because a "safe" camp or travel isn't anymore..or some named mob you've never heard of blasts you....<P>I love the new changes...since the last few patches I am watching every zone I move through closer...the world is slightly more real to me because I never know when the loathesomes might storm north qeynos....or the bandits close highpass....maybe Vox comes out of perma for a fresh air stroll through everfrost.....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003129.cgi&ReplyNum=000015&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Why|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

Some of the reported "miscons" may be due to the clerics who are a long fight (as all healers are)and because they seem to employ better tactics than most mobs - damage shields, intelligent buffs, fast casting and stunning spells, casting after running away a bit etc....</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003129.cgi&ReplyNum=000017&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Why|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I like flaming too, so I'm gonna call you an IDIOT "someone who likes changes"<P>These things are rediculous in newbie zones.  There have always been dangers in newbie zones yes.  But the problem here is not from the admittedly static spawns.  Its from groups of mid 20's and low 30's seeing a camp they can handle, pull from it and have multiple red "loathesomes" warp in out of no where to defend their friends...  Then that mid 20's to low 30's group ends up running into BB zone to escape, probably dropping members on the way to the zone.  And then, while there the "loathesomes" kill all the newbies around the mouth of BB.  Its atrocious.  <P>I am almost never in that side of the world anymore, but I went to Perma this weekend for some items.  As I came out of BB I saw literally dozens of bodies strewn about the entrance.  My first thought was "GM Event, oh what fun, escape fast"  Then I saw the camp, and the "Loathesomes"  Conned green to me, no problem.  I sat down and watched.  A group comes up, they pull it, it goes down.  All of a sudden another "Loathesomes" WARPS in.  No it did not spawn at the camp, and agro on them, it warps in from somewhere else, and makes a beeline for the group that just killed the other "Loathesome"  Then another one Warps in.  And these are conning white and Red to me at 29.  This group goes down fast with new mobs attacking them and they break run for the BB zone.  Sure enough the "Loathesomes" follow and sure enough, newbies are slaughtered.  There is no problem with High Level mobs in a relatively low level area.  But when they put them close enough to the only lowbie dungeon in that whole side of the world, that is a big problem.  The "Loathesomes" warping in bigger and meaner is a big problem.  All together its a bad idea on Verants part, and they need to fix it.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003129.cgi&ReplyNum=000018&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Why|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>I was killed at level 51 once by some monk NPC in the first sand area you come across when leaving West Freeport (I am DE but can safely walk the streets of Freeport).  I never saw it coming.  It killed me in 3 hits, all of which happened before i could do anything.<P>We have worked hard to get higher level.  There should be places we can go now that we can stand and be safe.

</FONT><HR>One more time - the replacement mobs don't "warp" in - they respawn in the same spot every time a short distance away from the loathesome camp and run in to the camp. They spawn in the same spot every time and run the same path every time - now how hard is that to anticipate?<P>The mid-20s-low 30s group you describe can easily solo pull one of the two spawns, working right through the progression. If a group at that level can't handle a SINGLE 35/36th mob then they need to go back to school and learn how to fight. </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003129.cgi&ReplyNum=000020&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Why|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>so your saying the situation for newbies/lowbies is kinda like (and this is a broad comparison mind you) how in oasis you have the spectre camp.  its static, and shouldn't be a problem to camp the place and hunt, except that idiots overpull and then choose to run to through a populated area, and then the mobs just kinda rampage untill someone finally offs them for the lowbies.  i suppose at least in oasis smart spectre hunters will at least go to sro, but many are dumb and run north either through docks or through orc highway.  problem with the new camp as far as i can see is that although many players can keep as good an eye out as possible for these loathesome individuals, they are still going to get killed often just because of incompetent people hunting things they dont know how to deal with.  i should think that eventually everyone hunting them will learn how to keep things in hand a little better, and things will die down somewhat</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003129.cgi&ReplyNum=000021&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Why|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Dunno about the rest of you, but I have actually fought the Loathesomes.  I am playing a 23rd level warrior.  I can say with some assurance that:<P>1) They aren't very aggro, at least the ones by the walls of Qeynos.  I walked up and hailed them. They don't say anything.<P>2) The are <b>WAAAAAYYY</b> under-conned.  This is my only problem with them.  One was blue to me so I attacked it.  He murdered me. I never <em>(read *never*)</em> damaged him ("his magical skin absorbed..")  He was casting some force of shock spell on me (I think) and I lost 125 HPs every time.  He kept blasting me for 125 until I died near the S Qeynos zone.  I have fought Hags in Unrest who weren't that dangerous.  They con Red to me.  Had he conned Red or Yellow, whichever was appropriate, I would not have attacked him.  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/confused.gif"><P>3) I got jumped by a pair in QH. I'd never been there and found what looked like a dungeon entrance near the NQ zone. The area was litteredw PC corpses. I said to my son, "Geez, why are all these dead PCs laying everywhere??" Then I realized something was wrong and BAM - I got attacked by a pair of them. Both conned green.  I ran as they chewed into me given my previous experience with them.  When I approached the NQ zone I turned around to test them. One had a sword, the other a robe.  Unlike any other pair of greens I have ever fought, they took me down half.  I won a Lore longsword and a Damask Robe.  Sold the sword, twinked my son  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/biggrin.gif"><P>So, I think as long as these aren't aggroing on newbies they're ok.  They should be modified so that they con accurately.  /con is the only way we have of sizing a mob up and it really needs to be ballpark accurate.<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003129.cgi&ReplyNum=000023&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Why|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Back when EQ was first released, many zones were not safe. Griffins in East Commons usually numbered around 2 or 3 at any time. West commons were crawling with giants. The Karanas were dangerous to cross without SoW and/or invis because of the mobs there. There was even a time when sand giants were common in North Ro. <P>At some point, the spawn tables were adjusted to be a little more friendly to the lower level people who were consistently eaten by griffins or stomped by giants.<P>Then server populations matured. There were suddenly enough people to cleanse entire zones of the nasty 35+ mobs and keep them that way, often solo. Travel was no longer that dangerous, just tedious. There really isn't an outdoor zone in which I have anything to fear (save Kunark).<P>Maybe this addition of mid-to-high level mobs is a poorly guided attempt to reintroduce the danger of travel again. Really, these new mobs will just become like the griffins of old, with constant status reports being /shouted across the zone as to it's current whereabouts. <P>But 45+ agro-everything mobs in zones where the average level is around 5-15 is probably a bit excessive. Especially if it's an isolated zone like Qeynos hills.<P>------------------<BR>Vdar D`Eris<BR>Mithaniel Marr<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=003129.cgi&ReplyNum=000024&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Why|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><br>This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum1/HTML/003129-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/Forum1/HTML/003129-2.html">2</A>&nbsp;<P>All times are ET (US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Verdana, Arial"><A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=003129&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum1&number=1&thisthread=003129&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
