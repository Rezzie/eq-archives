</FONT><HR>Hehehe, want to know something funny? I have a twink (twink no longer since he made lvl 47 and has LONG since left his twink gear behind), but I have never ONCE looked for a twinked character or even CARED if the person fighting besideds me was twinked. If he took down that gnoll, or orge high shaman along side me, then he (or she) was my best buddy!  <IMG SRC="http://forums.castersrealm.com/eq/biggrin.gif"><P>Recently I went on a quest for the Jeweled Skull. I needed someone to go with me deep into paw for one of the componets. I gave a shout, and a player answered that he would be glad to help, just for me to wait a second while he got his lvl 52 wizard online to help. Now he was playing a lvl 35 shaman (I think) at the time, hunting down in paw, I THINK he was twinked. Do you think I gave a rats butt? His wizard came up to me and we cleared out the execution room and he waited for my spawn before he left!<P>But lets look at it from Verants position. Now you have this situation where people will ,in your opinion, tire of the game and eventually will quit playing, thus quit PAYING. But low and behold, this paying customer will activate another character, usually out of curiosity, twink it and KEEP paying. You do not particually LIKE twinking, but it is putting money in your pocket, and no one has quit paying because they do not like it. What would you do?</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000075&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

</FONT><HR>   <BLOCKQUOTE><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Parm Vomgrossenhirn:<BR><B>My main character is lvl 44.  He groups with all sorts of people all the time.  Talking about twinks and non-twinks at this lvl is a bit silly.<P>I want to level up my twinky Paladin as fast as I can.  To that end, I don't want to have to give private EQ lessons to some true new player who doesn't know what is going on.  <P>In addition, playing with people who have newbie equipment just drags down the rate at which I can lvl this twink.  It is quite simple.  If my paladin groups with a warrior in patchwork armor and a fine steel long sword, one of two things will happen.  Either he will hit Taunt constantly and get himself completely thrashed, or else I will have the mob on me 100% of the time due to my superior weaponry, and he will just stand there not really contributing much dmg to the group dmg output, but will still suck up experience, in which case I would have been better off soloing in the first place.<P>In addition, since even first-time players gain equipment and such as they level, at some point the distinction between twinks and non-twinks starts to blur as the non-twinks twink themselves.  <P>I don't hate non-twinks.  My paladin has in fact grouped with non-twinks before.  He will likely do it again.  However, as a general practice (notice I didn't say as a general rule) I will tend to either solo or else group with players who are twinked *and* are experienced players, out of purely practical considerations.  If I group with a twinked player who turns out to be clueless, then I will disband and go play somewhere else.<P></B><HR></BLOCKQUOTE><P>I totally agree that in your 30s and 40s the twinking becomes a moot point simply due the the gear required to live at that level.<P>I also want to level as quickly as possible and don't like giving lessons either. This is one of main reasons why I don't like grouping with non-twinks. The fact is, I have been through these levels before and I know how to level fast. I don't want to wait between each pull because some new caster wants to have full mana to feel safe.<P>I also find that when I have grouped with an untwinked character, I feel as if I'm soloing and doing the majority of the damage as well.<P>You are correct in saying that the distinction between twinks and non-twinks blurs. As of right now, both my twink characters are in their mid-20s and even the first time players are starting to have some very nice equipment, especially with Kunark coming out and the prices of everything taking a plunge. I remember Serpentine Bracers being worth 150pp each on my server and now they sell for 30pp making it much easier for non-twinks to get. I think that the lowering of prices was much needed on my server and that it is great that lower characters are able to acquire some very nice gear at much lower prices than I was originally able to acquire it.<P>Another thing I want to clarify here guys, When I said that I don't group with the un-twinked ever, I was speaking about the lower levels which are so boring and I level very quickly and I want someone who can level just as quickly as I can where I'm not giving them all my experience by doing most of the damage in the group.<P>When you guys who are complaining about twinks get up in levels and make a twink of your own, then you might begin to understand what it is to be able to level at a much quicker rate. <P>First, you aren't looting as much because your twink has some money to live off of and you are fully stocked with food and drink so you aren't making random trips to town to purchase more. <P>Second, you don't have to spend time at the bazaar trying to find that piece of equipment that you want because you already have it. <P>Third, you ARE doing more damage as a twink than non-twinks are. Twinks regularly take out yellows and in some cases reds where untwinked has a hard time with yellows and reds being a full group.<P>Being in the mid-20s now with both my twinks I see that the line is blurring and that the un-twinked are learning their job. There is one cleric in particular that I taught how to play his class back when I started one of my twinks. He didn't know some key things and now he groups with me as much as he is able because he gets AWESOME experience with me and he also know his class now and has the same complaints about others not knowing their class.<P>Guys, I'm not against the un-twinked in any way! But I don't group with them for the reasons I stated above. When you guys who are so against me actually reach the point where I am at, you will better understand what I'm talking about in my posts here. But the simple fact is, the un-twinked USUALLY does not know his class yet because they haven't played or seen how a good player of that class plays. Sometimes you may group and never pay attention to what others in your group are doing. This is a mistake and can get your whole group killed because you may have some insight to how this person can play his character better and thereby keeping himself and others alive. Also you will see how other classes do their job in many situations. This is valuable to your future playing of other characters.<P>Hey guys, lets be reasonable. Everyone wants to play their game the way they wanna play it. I'm just asking for the benefit of the doubt when some of you guys flame me in your lack of understanding exactly why I'm doing what I'm doing. Maybe I have been unclear as to all the reasons why I don't group with the un-twinked and also what I consider to be twinked. I consider that being twinked is where you don't have to loot for the additional coppers that drop from the mobs you are killing and don't need to rely on another to take out the mob you are killing. If you can take out a yellow or red solo, without buffs or help from another player, then you are probably twinked out by my definition. And I am talking about un-twinked characters below their 20's.<P>I hope that this clears up some of the misunderstanding with my views. If not, then I'm sorry that I don't make you happy with my playstyle, but it is MY playstyle and not yours.<P>I hope everyone has a good time with their characters and that everyone levels fast and stays safe. <P>Corven<P>[This message has been edited by Corven (edited 10-03-2000).]<p>[This message has been edited by Corven (edited 10-03-2000).]</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000076&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Let's summarize it,<P>Twinking isn't evil, it's a playstyle.<BR>Soloing isn't evil, it's a playstyle.<BR>Twinking + soloing == best way to level up.<P>Hey, I agree with above all.<P>I choose twinking plus grouping since it is more fun to me. And I will happily group with anyone who is willing to play his class right, no matter what robe/armor he wears. I vividly remember the day I was wearing a woven tunic at high 20s so I will never turn down a person for group just because he is wearing a FBR.<BR>And why fast leveling up is so important? If you are so worried about hearing that 'DING', sooner or later you will be frustrated :P<BR>Any eventually what weapon you are using isn't essential anymore, it's how you play your class that counts. And by grouping, you learn the best of it.

</FONT><HR>I don't like twinking.  Seems kind of cheesy too me and devalues items.  I don't even want a SMR after seeing a whole group on orc hill wearing them.  I just don't see playing a game as *paying dues*.  The part that sucks most about twinking is haveing to roll on an item in a group only you can use, because someone wants to give it to their twink.  I have seen 20 people in dalnir, not one of them a monk, camping items to give to a charactor they are thinking of creating, while a monk sits looking for a group.  I wish they would only let you have one charactor per server personally.  But then again, maybe I am just weird.<P>------------------<BR>Mihos Bubastis<BR>&lt;Everwalkers&gt;<BR>Tribunal</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000079&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

If u want to know who i am, i'm a lvl 20 paladin named Siane on Bertoxxlous(i don't play my 51 cleric cuz i'm sick of it). And I do'nt get why registering myself proves u got balls either as you seem to suggest. my posts are read just like everyone elses.<P>To answer your question, I don't care how u play, where u play, or when u play. doesn't matter to me.  But when you think you are better than another person, automatically sterotyping that anyone who does'nt have ultra high items, that they are some loser newbie that doesn't deserve to be grouped with you.  Thats just sad and thats why you are a loser.  Yes i've grouped with "newbies" and "veterans" but the fact is, YOU URSELF was a newbie once, and imagine being treated as if your some pile of **** that doesn't deserve to group with those "mighty" ppl.  Or maybe you have, and so u project that in ur gameplay to others. And by the way, not saying soloing is right or wrong, nor grouping. The way i see it, if u group at low lvls, you don't kow how to play your class.  Yes groupings fun, some prefer it etc etc. but corven, if ur some almighty twink thats so powerful, why the **** are you grouping in the first place? by the way, i could solo my paladin past 50, if i choose. but by the time i'm mid 30 and up i'm grouping simply because the xp is safer if u know where to fight.  And by the time ur mid 30, equipment isn't much of a factor.  Yah an FBSS helps. but any bronze clad 35th paladin can kill a shin ghoul in LGUK just like one with a wurmslayer, doesn't matter. they have a slightly longer downtime, but how much xp do u really gain if u had an hour advantage over him/her? half bar? a bar? boy that sure makes u better then "THEM". </FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000080&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>Seriously, twinking doesn't harm anyone anymore than normal game play.  <BR>1 complaint would be, that guy was farming a spawn someone else wnated for his twink.  What's the difference if it goes to his twink or goes for sale?<BR>2 he hordes all the newbie critters.  Bah, a lvl 4 hordes all the newbie critters from a lvl 1 but he doesn't give harped on.  That all changes when twinks "grow into" their gear anyways.<P>There is nothing wrong with twinking and 90% of the people that say otherwise are just jealous because they don't have the gear.  Try this on for size.  Your lvl 14 is yelling at my twinked lvl 6 because i have such great gear.  Your lvl 14 is your main.  I (and i do) have a lvl 56 cleric, 48 monk and 46 rogue (not to mention a bunch of others around 30)  The cleric, monk, and rogue have not been twinked.  Imagine the amount of time i've spent leveling those characaters as high as they are.  What gives you the right to judge me as a lamer because i wanted to take a break from the higher lvl monsters and have some fun as a low lvl?<P>Some people like the challenge of starting completely over with no help ( i did it 3 times myself and lvled them post 45.)  But sometimes i just want a break.  And if i feel like making a shadow knight with a wurmslayer and full black fine steel plate, tough cookies.  I'd have to say that 99% of the people that complain are people that have never even leveled a characater over 30.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000081&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#F7F7F7">

What you need to do is read the above post where I did clarify my view quite succintly if I do say so myself. Specifically dealing with what I consider a newbie to be and when "twinking" stops having the effect of being twinked.<P>(3) Fact is, you are right and I was a newbie once! Yes I do remember being excluded from groups after people inspected me and said that I would not be able to keep up with them. Have I ever inspected someone, ie conned someone, before I say yes or no to grouping? NO I HAVEN'T! But at the lower levels, ie 20 and under, you can easily tell with a glance if the person is able to produce as much damage and take as many knocks as you can!<P>(4) And no I do not project that in my gameplay to others. If I don't want to group with them, then I simply say that we are doing fine thanks for asking! I am very courteous to others and I also give away tons of stuff and cash to any obvious newbie characters that I do run across.<P>(5) This point makes no sense at all! I never said I was the ultimate almighty twink. I did say that I was twinked. I may choose to group at low levels because I want to play with my friends who are also twinked and have made new characters. This happens all the time. The fact is, I never said anything about soloing all the time because I can either. I said that I could solo yellows and reds without help from others! And yes, when I make a necro, he will probably solo up to 50 IF I CHOOSE TO PLAY HIM THIS WAY!<P>Fact is if you "dont care how, when or where I play", then shut your *ss up about MY PLAYSTYLE! <P>When I started posting on this post, I WAS SIMPLY DEFENDING THE RIGHT OF EACH PLAYER TO PLAY HIS GAME THE WAY HE WANT TO PLAY IT! But some people thought that my giving advice to others on how to play better was somehow in contradiction with this. It is not in contradiction! Showing someone to play better still allows them the choice of how they play their game. Now if they want to play with me, they will play well, or I will remove them from the group. And no I'm not a jerk that removes you at your first mistake, but if you make that same mistake like 4 times in a row after people in the group have asked you to correct it, then yes, removal is immanent!<P>Corven<P>PS Why dont you try reading the whole post before you accuse me of things which I have already explained in earlier posts on this subject!<P></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000082&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>We seem to be at a bit of an impasse n'est ce pas?<P>This would appear to be a classic dichotomy: Twinkers can easily justify their twinking to themselves (and to other twinkers); Non-twinkers can easily explain why twinking is "wrong" to likeminded anti-twinks; but never the twain shall meet.<P>There is a fundamental philosophical chasm between the 2 camps that will probably never be bridged: Let us make one of those classic sweeping generalisations, shall we, (The sort that leaves one open for a broadside of flaming) and divide the whole EQ community into 2 camps:<P>The "TWINKIES"<BR>Percieve EQ as a race with level 60 as the finish line, or a competition to see who has the biggest/baddest/best gear and who can kill the biggest/baddest/best mobs. Twinking is both justifiable and desirable. Other twinkies striving to "win" the same "race" can appreciate your twinking, because they are trying to do the same thing, and sure, grouping with other players will help you win the race if they are "assets" (aka twinked)<P>The "RPGers"<BR>"The journey is more important than the destination". "Its not what you do, its the way that you do it". To a RPGer you must EARN that Rawhide fur-lined codpiece AC 1 casts "Itchy-crotch" DoT on wearer saves +1 versus numbnuts. Playing a character of low intelligence means that you must do STUPID things - even to the detrement of your level/experience (especially to the detrement...etc). Knowing how to be the perfect TANK is of no use if your character is fundamentally stupid - the character has to do dumb stuff, otherwise you aint roleplaying. Seeing a twink is like finding a dead rat in the lunchbox - It does not fit in. To a RPGer a level 10 player in full UBERtwink gear is like a slap in the face, because it "cannot be so" (like turning up to your 8 year old daughter's school sports day and finding out that Marion Jones is entered in every event), it just couldn't shouldn't happen and therefore detracts from the all important  "experience".<P>What I am trying to say is that the two philosophies are mutually incompatible. "I am right in my world and you are right in yours" We could keep posting on the topic ad infinitum (rather than ad nauseum; which has already been achieved) without achieving a consensus.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000094&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">

</FONT><HR>I do agree that there are those two camps!<P>However, there may be a third camp! A camp where someone playing this game as if it were a community. (Even if they did inherit a large sum from a rich uncle) These people may be people who enjoy both sides of the two camps.<P>Let me explain. I'm a person who definately enjoys the twinking aspect of the game. But I also enjoy the roleplaying aspect of the game. Just because I give my new players an advantage with twinking doesn't mean that I'm in this game to get to level 60 as quickly as possible. I enjoy finding the occasional quest and attempting to follow it through to completion. I just feel that my new characters have a better chance of roleplaying these quests with twink gear.<P>Just an observation of another reason why people twink!<P>Corven<P>PS---To all who have debated this subject:<BR>This has been very enjoyable even when you have flamed me and has given me reason to examine my reasons very closely and have a reason for the things that I do.<P>So thanks to all for their participation on this subject!

Just because someone is against something doesn't mean they are jealous that they can't do it.  I am totally against Farming not because I can't do it (my main character can do it if he wanted) but because I am tired of going into dungeons and having a 55+ person farming all the good stuff while my group could be getting good exp and loot from these mobs.  That doesn't include Jealousy and I don't like it.<P>I used to be against Twinking because before I got my main character up to the point of being a almost high level I didn't understand that these were just items that were being cycled down to their lower level characters (or at least thats how I twink, find a cool item that I don't need for my main or don't want to sell, give to one of my other characters to hold), I wasn't jealous that they could twink and I couldn't, I could give a crap less if I could twink, I just didn't think it was right for a 2nd level warrior to be outfitted in all crafted at the time but now I know better.</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Verdana, Arial">IP: <A HREF="http://forums.castersrealm.com/cgi-bin/eq/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=1&topic=002966.cgi&ReplyNum=000096&forum=General+Discussion&TopicSubject=Mmmmm....Twinkies">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#DEDFDF">
