<p>Formed by Chance Nifield in November of 1994 in a text based game called MajorMud, 
  the Knights of Terror have always been a force to be reckoned with. From the 
  start KoT was a purely evil PK guild based on mass destruction. They hunted 
  down and slayed any player character that was not affiliated with them, be it 
  for gold, items, or merely for satisfaction. </p>
<p>The foundation for the Knights of Terror was built on real-life friendships 
  that grew into online chaos. Lord Sandraxys Blackfire, the first ever member 
  of the KoT, was a co-founder and to this day one of Chance Nifield's closest 
  friends. Unfortunately Sandraxys has not been part of the KoT online organization 
  since the days of MajorMud back in 1995. </p>
<p>From MajorMud the KoT moved to circle muds, and then on to Diablo where they 
  hassled, killed, and thieved from other players that had no knowledge of how 
  terrible KoT could be. A number of months passed in Diablo and day after day, 
  people like Gotham Grock, Braylor Hawkes, and Saradon Warchild were spreading 
  fear throughout the land and making one hell of a name for the Knights of Terror. 
  To this day KoT members names can be found on wanted lists from diablo 1.</p>
<p> In 1997 things took a big turn for the Knights of Terror as Ultima Online 
  was introduced to the gaming community. On release of this new more global scaled 
  world, the KoT worked hard and dedicated a lot of time into learning how to 
  use this new playing field to their advantage. They finally settled on one of 
  the northern islands of the ultima online world, and met some of the most loyal 
  members they ever would come by. Shotcaller, Shade, Naf, and Red Talon, were 
  some of these new KoT eager to spill blood and make sure no one felt safe on 
  what we called "KoT Island". Stockpiling boats and boat keys, armor and weapons, 
  we built a legacy on that island. As the months went on more and more people 
  came to fight us, and more and more people died. Eventually as members tired 
  of the game and stopped playing, the KoT were chased from their home and forced 
  to relocate. In the relocation/rebuilding process the KoT picked up two of their 
  most trusted members in Bob and Doug Mckenzie. These two, eager to become part 
  of our famed guild went on killing sprees larger then life breathing new life 
  into the dorment guild. Some members spurred by the two new members came back 
  and once again the Knights of Terror were a force to be reckoned with. Based 
  out of the dungeon "Wrong" they continued their lifestyle of slaughtering players, 
  looting houses, and causing mahem to lord british's events. But yet again, players 
  lost interest, and slowly the guild turned to a dorment state once again. </p>
<p>The summer of 1998 brought a new element to the guild as they organized their 
  first real life meeting in Pomona, California. Chance Nifield and Gotham Grock 
  travelled many miles from british columbia canada and had a blast partying with 
  our southwestern KoT brothers. We then also attended a UO Napa Valley gathering, 
  and succeeded to be the only ones to be hung over at 10am in the morning. Although 
  hung over, members still had enough energy to make fun of and disturb the function 
  at least once. </p>
<p>The KoT showed sparks again when in March of 1999 Everquest was released. This 
  new game was quite a bit different from what the KoT was used to. More so based 
  on leveling and spending time killing monsters, the KoT were not as affective 
  as in previous games. Members were so spread out in level range, and geographic 
  location that it was hard for them to be very affective as a group. Still the 
  KoT pked, looted and annoyed other players as much as they could, but EverQuest 
  producers started tweaking the game so the whiney role playing power gamers 
  would get their way. This led to less interest in the game, and then finally 
  to people quitting the game completely. In the months after Braylor Hawkes another 
  one of KoT's finest, led the guild for a short time in an inspirational come back.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2000 the KoT had a real life BBQ with members from around 
  North America. On entry all members were required to do a shot called a rocky 
  mountain bear fucker which was made up of 1/3 tequila, 1/3 jack daniels, and 
  1/3 151 proof rum. Once into the BBQ kegs were tapped and many drinks were hoisted 
  in a truly awesome 3 day party. These parties seperate a real pk from the roleplaying 
  wannabe's that we kill. </p>
<p>Now it is late 2001. Other then sparks in games like Diablo 2, Anarchy Online, 
  and Asherons Call, KoT again has layen dorment waiting for another game where 
  we all can ride once more and cause unmatchable chaos and complete destruction. 
  I believe that game is upon us... we rally our troops now and fire breathes 
  from our horses snouts. Watch for us looting your town next, in Dark Age of 
  Camelot. </p>
