<p>AO has been through two major patches in the last 24 hours, and<br>
  the final day of beta is marked as a huge PvP fest! Each player will <br>
  be &quot;twinked&quot; to level 75 and given a mass amount of credits to spend.</p>
<p>KoT is planning to meet up at Tir's South Gate at 8pm Pacific to go<br>
  on a classic killing spree. Screenshots forthcoming!<br>

<p>KoT is in AO! Including vet players ShotCaller, Naf, Doug McKenzie<br>
  and RedTalon, the near decade-old guild is once again in force.<br>
  KoT will be a major power behind the side of the Clan.</p>
<p>We are actively recruiting for those seeking a guild in AO. If you <br>
  want to join a close-knit, PvP oriented guild, contact us at <br>
  <a href="mailto:knightsofterror@hotmail.com">knightsofterror@hotmail.com</a></p>
<p>We look for non-roleplaying, dedicated and experienced<br>
  players. All requests for joining the guild will be screened and<br>
  approved by a majority of current members.</p>

<p>I've gotten some time to work on the site a bit. I'm fixing all <br>
  broken links and adding some general info concerning AO.</p>
