I just figured I'd let you non UO players know what's been going on in UO. I got ahold of Richard Nixon and Cartman (not Brona) on icq and they joined back up with us, I also talked to Riocard and he will be coming back soon also. Right now KoT has 15 members with an average magery of 88 overall. Thanks to Bob for giving me a Guildstone deed which allowed me to start T*T (Thieves of Terror). Right now it is Meire's thief, my thief, Talon's thief and Laughsalot's thief, but we will grow. FeelMyLove (of KoT!) is on the bounty board with 79 murders and Richard Nixon is also on the board. As of today, Meire, Nixon, Cartman, and Red Talon all have magery to work back up after dying in statloss but we'll make it. Bob McKenzie the II is also a stat loss red now but very much alive. We have formed an official allience with TLC (The Love Crusade) and between the two guilds we own the bounty board. I would like to see some of our oldschool KoT back in UO. Shot, you sold your eq char right? Still waiting for your UO char to get his ass in here! Hel, sure would be nice to PK with you some time!<br>
BTW, KoT has an IRC channel because ICQ is a memory hoggin lag makin biatch! Our Channel (for now) is KoTChristmas hope to see you all there!
