<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ric Flair</div><div class="date">Dec 20, 2001, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a Civ TOT game I had a 1 city (Godiva) in 1945. In 1946 I turned around and it had a population of 33 without benefit of food caravans or trade caravans, etc.<br />
     A nearby city (Orlando) had a population of 13 and was growing nicely in 1945 and in 1946 it has a population of 46 with NO food, shields or trade at all, hunger 97 with nothing showing on the city view except a red mask in the middle of a black background.  <br />
     Furthermore, Orlando has disappeared from the world map although when I move a unit over the square where Orlando was, the game says the two mech inf defending Orlando are still there! Orlando still shows up in the city status report.<br />
     Another nearby city (Washington) saw me rush build an airport there early in the 1946 turn, only now instead of 160/160 the city status report says 8192/160!<br />
     Has anyone else seen this kind of city growth and if so do they have any idea what causes it?</div></div><hr />

Usually that kind of city growth has to be managed very carefully.</div></div><hr />
