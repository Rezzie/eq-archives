<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2002, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After the previous poll and the discussion that followed, this is the set of victory conditions that seem to have the most support.  As this wasn't one of the voting options in the last poll, another poll is in order.<br />
<br />
Proposed Victory Conditions for GOTM:<br />
<br />
Gold Medal<br />
Silver Medal<br />
Bronze Medal<br />
<br />
Highest Diplomacy Score<br />
Fastest Conquest Victory<br />
Fastest Domination Victory<br />
Fastest Cultural Victory<br />
Fastest Spaceship Victory<br />
<br />
Having medals for highest score, along with highest score by victory type is redundant.  The games that can win an award are all homogenous &quot;milked&quot; games which only differ in the victory condition chosen at the end.<br />
<br />
Judging the victory conditions by date is more indicative of how well the game was played.  It also allows for more diverse playstyles to compete, instead of having &quot;conquer early, build up to 2050&quot; as the only viable way of earning an award.  The exception is with the Diplomatic victory condition.  It is more difficult to score well while keeping the AI happy, than to just build the UN at the earliest possible date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 14, 2002, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seem to be pretty well supported so far, if not all that vocally. (bump ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Mar 15, 2002, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep. I guess we'll change the rules then. ;) For the next GOTM (VI), the modifications you mentioned above will count!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirty Clint</div><div class="date">Mar 15, 2002, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You mean to say that all the hard work I did in this months game to try and get a spaceship icon next to my name has been brought to nothing.:cry: :cry: <br />
 Never mind, more money in my shrinks bank account I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 15, 2002, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All the medals and awards for GOTM1-5 are still being kept I think.  These rules will only go into effect for next month's game (GOTM6) and later.  It wouldn't be fair to penalize past play because the goals were different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Mar 16, 2002, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, of course they're being kept! As I said: from the next GOTM (VI) these rules changes will take place. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirty Clint</div><div class="date">Mar 16, 2002, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's ok guys, I was only being silly. I think the changes are a great idea. :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mogon</div><div class="date">Apr 04, 2002, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">YES !<br />
I hate milking !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, I just noticed something: you didn't mention the histographic award, Aeson. Did you do that deliberately, or not? Everybody agrees to this, but when I don't award the highest histographic vocitory, people will undoubtly come and shout where the hell that thing went. They might even rightly accuse me of using my powers to push my own wishes (of not having that award).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was intentional :)<br />
<br />
The medals can be viewed as &quot;Histograph&quot; awards, as usually the highest scores will be from 2050 milked games.  To have another award for Histograph victories would be redundant.<br />
<br />
A similar case could be made against the highest Diplomatic score award, which will usually be a 2050 milked game as well.  The difference is that to achieve a Diplomatic victory the player has to sacrifice some score to keep one of the AI as a friend.  There will still be cases where Diplomatic victories also win medals, but it will take more skill to do than any of the other 2050 milked victories.<br />
<br />
If it ends up that the medals are consistantly being won by people who went after the Diplomatic award, then maybe it should be dropped as well.  An equally well played game that isn't limited by keeping the AI willing to vote should score more though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see. Good point. :)<br />
<br />
Do you think the common fastest finish award should be kept? http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3gotm/gotm_images/GreenStar.gif I find it a big obscolete now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's another that was made obsolete, yes.  The fastest conquest will almost always be the &quot;fastest finish&quot; award, no need to duplicate it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 06, 2002, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That has also been the case, when the highest conquest score was awarded. Just take a look (http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3gotm/civ3gotm_hof.shtml).<br />
<br />
So that one goes as well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alc0p0pz</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2002, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definately agree with the fastest victory as opposed to the highest score. Good call. :goodjob: <br />
<br />
However, I don't understand why the Diplo victory is excluded.<br />
Why not have a fastest Diplo victory as well? :confused: <br />
<br />
Like the SpaceShip, it would require advancing quickly.<br />
Also, it'd take a good player to get to Fission quickly and hold the vote immediately ... a lesser player may have to wait before holding the vote to butter up the AI.<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2002, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, fastest Diplomatic victory has some loopholes.  All the player really has to do to get a Diplomatic victory is build the UN and not get into any wars.  It could easily turn into a &quot;lazy&quot; victory condition.<br />
<br />
At higher difficulties, getting to Fission fastest is often a matter of letting the AI do the research, and not interfering.  The player can have a very small empire, and still get to the UN vote just as fast.  The AI would have more room to expand, and thus more possible beakers to apply their research bonus to.  The player just saves up money and buys the techs once everyone else has them, prebuilding the Palace to switch to the UN.  The AI reasearches at maximum capacity because the player is funding them.<br />
<br />
It's not the only way to achieve Diplomatic victories quickly, but it is possible to do this way.  The date the UN is built just isn't a very good measure of skill.<br />
<br />
Conversely, to score well with a Diplomatic win means conquest of some sort.  Going to war means putting potential votes in jeapardy.  It also requires the player to do well in all areas of civ management, not just in the timing of the UN prebuild.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chiefpaco</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2002, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love the new awards.  Gives many more different playing options available.  <br />
<br />
I think the only downside could be the GOTM spoilers thread.  It would probably be a lot easier to tell what people have done wrt quick victories.  Before, it didn't matter so much because it was hard to tell how much score you had just by a game's description.  It is a bit easier to tell how fast people rip through the game by their story.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if we'll get a rash of descriptions in the final day or will people give away their game earlier?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2002, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, posting  dates will give things away.  I tried not to be too descriptive in my spoiler posts, just giving a vague description of my game.  I'll make a more in depth post later on, some of the info would just be too much of a spoiler.</div></div><hr />
