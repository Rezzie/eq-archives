The term "light tank" has been used in the past, but that's when people were using "tank" for both dealers and takers of damage. At the time, there were several rather lengthly threads where everyone here on the board agreed that the term "tank" should only apply to damage takers. <br>Their role hasn't changed mid-stream. What did happen is a further shift towards offensive from defensive between 50 and 60. However this same trend was happening in the prior levels and just continued into the post 50 ones. <br><br>-Gordon</i></b><br><br>Uhm... yupyup. He's right there.

Latest Flameplay news brought to you by Kivorn Teleri, the nauseous ranger:<br><br><i>Gordon, if you think Rangers and Monks are balanced...and yet 90% of the Ranger and Monk player population claims OTHERWISE... <br><br><strong>Well I disagree that this is the case. Perhaps 90% of the ones on this board claim otherwise, but that doesn't represent 90% of the actual population. Please keep in mind that I see complaints in varying numbers from week to week from every class claiming that they aren't balanced. Is everyone correct? If everyone is correct that their class is unbalanced in a negative way, doesn't that in fact mean that they are balanced? The later is a philosophical question. </strong><br><br>Why don't YOU post why you think they are balanced?  Why don't YOU post the benefits they bring to a GROUP? <br><strong><br>Because they fulfil their desired role in game. To head off the inevitable questions of, "What is my role?", I would expect that people would discover that while in the process of building their characters. Find a niche that you fill. There is indeed a place for you. </strong><br><br>Why don't YOU post how to avoid getting creamed by Kunark monsters? <br><strong><br>By being a part of a sufficiently talented and balanced group. <br></strong><br>Why don't YOU post why any group would want a Monk or Ranger over a Warrior or Rogue?<strong><br><br>Again, this is for players to figure out, of course the first thing that comes to mind here is, if you already have a warrior and a rogue.  The monk still does more toe-to-toe damage than any other class given appropriate equipment. <br></strong><br>Then id like you to RE-ANSWER questions 2 and 3 from a group situation with NO WARRIOR present and the Monk or Ranger as primary tank <strong><br><br>The Monk or Ranger will do about as well as a 'primary tank' (cf. damage taker) as a Rogue. Palys, SKs, and Warriors can fill that pretty well, not Monks, Rangers, and Rogues. <br><br>- Gordon</i></strong><br><br>I think I'll start linking to his posts from now on... mainly because I just flamed his ass off on that post of his.
