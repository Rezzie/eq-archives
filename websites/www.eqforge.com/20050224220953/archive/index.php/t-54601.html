<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 29, 2003, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO we are ready to start WLTP now to get many cities to size 8 (maybe 9 or 10) and Dou to 12. It will be somewhat difficult to keep all the cities celebrating for long because of corruption (especially a problem in the east) so I think we need to emphasize growth in the core cities (Dou, LC, Neu, RF, LP EF and maybe FW).<br />
<br />
I'm recommending we start WLTP immediately by setting luxuries to 40% and taxes to 60%, we need gold in the coming turns to rush buy stuff. We will probably need to set luxuries to an even bigger values soon as the cities grow. I also recommend adjusting production in some cities to increase trade and make them celebrate and in some cases rush buying stuff (harbors so we can work ocean squares and marketplace in Neu to increase trade to make the city celebrate). This is crucial so we can get needed effects from the high luxuries.<br />
<br />
Do not vote for any of the B's, C's or D's unless you vote for either A1 or A2. Also E, F and G do not make a lot of sense unless you vote for A1 or A2.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions and criticism welcome since we are probably just about to start transforming our empire into something far bigger than what we currently have.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully we then can get more money with a lower taxrate, still keep our cities happy at a lower luxrate and have such good production that we can finish Isaac's not to long after it's all done.:)</div></div><hr />
