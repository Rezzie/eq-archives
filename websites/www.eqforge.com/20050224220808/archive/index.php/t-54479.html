Things to consider:<br />
Was I really supposed to switch to improvements in Nae, EF and Ipec? The total loss of shields could've built a caravan... Well, I did anyway.<br />
<br />
Dou will get an aqueduct in 2. Shall we raise luxuries now, or just hire elvii in Dou (it's possible to get 4 happies, rest content and one food surplus) to grow it. Remember that growth only start on second turn of celebration.<br />
<br />
One caravan boarded, the others can board next turn or in two turns. Are we ready to get them to their destinations?<br />
<br />
Shall we RB any improvements?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do we need to decide which to take, or does the bolded Banking indicate that is what we are researching (I don't have the game at work so I could check myself)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 28, 2003, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like we should start celebrating now or in one or 2 turns. For this 40 or 50% luxuries are needed (40% probably sufficient if we RB MP in Neu now). It will be difficult to keep the eastern cities celebrating for long because of corruption (maybe we should RB a courthouse in one of them soon ?). In contrast, we should easily be able to get most of the core cities to size 8-10 and Dou to 12. The cities we should prioritize ahead of other cities when it comes to growth are IMO LC, RF, Neu, LP and maybe EF and/or FW (I'd also include PB if it had reached size 3). We probably need more irrigation near LC ASAP.<br />
<br />
We are researching banking. This creates one 'problem': I'd very much like to complete a bank in Dou before delivering Dou's caravans in order to maximize the bonus gold/science.</div></div><hr />

We are researching banking. This creates one 'problem': I'd very much like to complete a bank in Dou before delivering Dou's caravans in order to maximize the bonus gold/science.  Not an issue, as banks don't increase the bonus.  The bonus is based on total base trade and banks only increase gold and luxuries, not trade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 30, 2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IIRC only basetrade, (i.e. all arrows worked on the map, including corruption and not any previous traderoutes),  commodity (which, and if it is demanded), foreign or domestic and distance will affect the pay-off.<br />
