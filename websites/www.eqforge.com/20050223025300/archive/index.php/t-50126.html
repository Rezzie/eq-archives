One idea is to keep it in Neumatic. Another is to found a new city on southern hill and build Col there, and build HG in Neumatic.<br />
<br />
I recommend the later, because the spot has more specials and rivers. We need two settlers though for that spot, one from RF and the other from either LP or LC. LP settler is done in 6 turns, RF settler in two and LC settler in 11 turns. I'd recommend helping the production in LC with some cash, and make sure it's ready when RF settler arrives down there (or soon after at least).<br />
<br />
Any objections? Tell your idea...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did NOT vote for Col as priority for SSC, because we may want/need a guard/temple first.  Obviously will need to start on it very soon, however, given as late as we are and the way the AI likes to go after it.  Also did not vote for RF options as I don't have the game here to view the city details, so will leave that to those who know more than I :)</div></div><hr />

What I meant with first priority is that we definitely shouldn't miss it. A guard or two might boost the production because we won't need elvis and can therefore have max production. Maybe we should let LC build one guard for the SSC after its settler is finished, and let the SSC build one itself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Apr 11, 2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If LC can build a guard after finishing it's settler for SSC that would be helpful.  Do we want to consider a temple before starting Colossus, or is time running short and we need to start it right away?  I agree Colussus should be the SSC's priority once it's own needed infrastructure is in place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zelig</div><div class="date">Apr 13, 2003, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A) Found new city to be SSC (e.g. southern hill city)<br />
<br />
B) HG in neumatic (recommended unless kept as SSC)<br />
<br />
C) Build Colossus in SSC first priority<br />
After basic infrastructure is established, e.g. 1 guard and a temple.<br />
<br />
D) RF build temple <br />
after settler, of course<br />
<br />
E) If southern hilll city - use LC settler to mine<br />
I'd rather mine with the RF settler and found with the LC settler, since the RF settler will be done sooner, and RF is bigger, so it can better stand to lose the food from the settler.<br />
<br />
Remember that we have to build the city on the hill, while it is being mined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Apr 13, 2003, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think we have time to both build a new SSC on the hill and to build the colossus there ahead of the AI civs.<br />
<br />
However, we definitely should try to do this by founding a city on the hill ASAP but deciding now whether to make it an SSC is really premature and depends on what the AI civs do and how fast. Neumatic should start a wonder immediately (it should rush buy its temple now) so we can switch to the colossus and build it there instead of in the (yet to be founded) hill city if it starts looking like the AI civs will be ahead if us building it.<br />
<br />
Another thing to take into account is that in the short term the hill city will have bad trade and slow growth because the square it is to be founded on (the hill) has no trade and little food.</div></div><hr />

That's what I thought but apparently I wrote it the other way around. Naturally, the settler that arrives first start mining and the second founds the city.<br />
<br />
It seems most people like the idea of trying to have our SSC on the hill. If we get any indications of the AI trying to build HG or Col, we'll have to discuss what to do then. Once the mine is ready, the city can be put at full production, but I still think we should let LC take care of its happiness. The city won't grow fast and we can easily transfer a warrior (probably from LC) once the city start getting to size three.:)</div></div><hr />
