That way everyone has the same amount of time (in theory) to play it.  I believe the last day for GOTM 6 was May 2.</div></div><hr />

So the submission deadline of the GOTM VI has passed now...</div></div><hr />

Just out of curiosity Matrix, what about time zones?  For example, I had exams throughout april, so I didn't have much time to play.  Essentially I played the game in two days right at the end.  I submitted at Midnight on May 2.  But midnight for me is like 7am on May 3 for you!  I am assuming that it's still OK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MadScot</div><div class="date">Jul 19, 2002, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Matrix - can you put the submission deadline on the game page (it's on 8 but not 9, FYI) or put a note in the FAQ that it's the second of the month.<br />
<br />
I just spent a while hunting to finally find the answer in this thread.<br />
<br />
And yes, I know what LtKiller's response will be :spank:</div></div><hr />
