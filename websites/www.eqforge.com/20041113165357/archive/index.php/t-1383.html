<br />
Anyway, I am making an update of Captain Nemo's 2194 DAYS OF WAR scenario, with a major focus on multiplayer, but the problem is I need a new map.<br />
<br />
I am going to make it on a Giga-map, and the only map of the world I can find in Giga size, would not work well for a WW2 scenario.<br />
<br />
I am not good at making maps as my artistic ability lacks in that area, but I want to make this scenario.<br />
<br />
If anyone would like to help me make a new map, or with anything else, please e-mail me at pap1723@aol.com, or contact me on AOL or AOLIM at pap1723.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marko</div><div class="date">Apr 20, 2001, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some time ago Mercator made a very good Earth map. He made the map in 4 parts each about the max allowed Civ2 map size (then there were no ideas about Gigamaps yet). <br />
As I remember he didn't finished the maps, everything was grassland, but it was in high quality. <br />
You can use his Mapeditor to make these 4 maps to one Gigamap and then add terrain. <br />
It is good in scenario making if you start from all-grassland map because then you can decide yourself which terrain to use for what. For example you can use some terrain types for special resources (oilfields etc).<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />
