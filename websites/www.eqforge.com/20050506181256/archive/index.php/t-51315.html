<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">Apr 23, 2003, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Constitution<br />
<br />
We, the people of Fanatica, in order to create an atmosphere of friendship and <br />
cooperation, establish this Constitution of our beloved country. We uphold the <br />
beliefs that each citizen must have a voice in the government and ruling of our <br />
country, that government itself is a construct of and servant to the people, that <br />
rules, regulations, and laws should be established to facilitate the active <br />
participation of the people and to make possible the dreams and desires of the <br />
citizens.<br />
<br />
A. Governing rules shall consist of these Articles of the Constitution, such <br />
   amendments that shall follow and lower forms of law that may be <br />
   implemented. No rule shall be valid that contradicts these Articles <br />
   excepting an amendment specifically tasked to do so.<br />
<br />
B. All Civfanatics Forum users who register in the Citizen Registry are <br />
   citizens of Fanatica. Citizens have the right to assemble, the right to <br />
   free movement, the right to free speech, the right to a fair trial, the right to <br />
   representation, the right to demand satisfaction and the right to vote.<br />
<br />
   1. Political parties are not permitted.<br />
<br />
C. The government will consist of the Executive Branch, Legislative Branch <br />
   and Judicial Branch.<br />
<br />
   1. The Executive Branch is headed by the President, the overall <br />
      Leader of the land, and shall include a Council of Leaders, each of <br />
      whom heads a department that is responsible for one major facet of <br />
      the country. Each of these Leaders will be generally responsible for <br />
      the items found under the respective Advisor in the Civilization III <br />
      game and esoteric aspects that fall under their department name.<br />
<br />
         a. The President shall be the designated player of the game. <br />
            The President is responsible for following the legal <br />
            instructions of all Leaders during play of the game.<br />
<br />
   2. The Legislative Branch will be formed of two houses, the Senate <br />
      and the Congress.<br />
<br />
      a. The Senate will be formed of the Provincial Governors, each <br />
         of whom are a Leader responsible for the care, management <br />
        and use of the cities and lands of a province.<br />
<br />
      b. The Congress will be formed of the entirety of the citizenry. <br />
         Congress shall have the primary duty of creating laws.<br />
<br />
   3. The Judicial Branch will be formed of three Leaders and is tasked <br />
      with verifying legality of legislation, interpreting rules, and <br />
      determining when violations occur. Each also has a specific <br />
      area of additional responsibility.<br />
<br />
      a. The Chief Justice is the overall head of the Judiciary and can <br />
         fill in for either lower position. The Chief Justice is <br />
         responsible for maintaining the legal books of the country <br />
         and the mechanics of Judicial Procedure.<br />
<br />
      b. The Judge Advocate functions in a role of prosecution and <br />
         attorney to the state when allegations of rulebreaking have <br />
         been made.<br />
<br />
      c. The Public Defendant functions in the roll of defense for any <br />
         and all accused citizens.<br />
<br />
D. All offices will be filled via elections to serve fixed terms.<br />
<br />
E. No person shall hold multiple Leader positions simultaneously.<br />
<br />
F. The average of the number of votes cast in each of the most recent <br />
   contested elections shall constitute an active census of citizens. The <br />
   highest vote total of these elections shall constitute a full census (the <br />
   Congress). A majority of the Congress shall be required to amend the <br />
   Constitution. A 2/3 majority of the Senate shall be required to ratify said <br />
   amendment.<br />
<br />
G. Elected officials must plan and act according to the will of the people.<br />
<br />
H. Any game actions taken by the DP must be documented in a game play <br />
   log (examples: Notes or chat log). The game play log must be made <br />
   publicly available in a timely manner.<br />
<br />
   1. Commission of any game action that is not instantly reversible by <br />
      any person other than the President while carrying out his/her <br />
      duties is strictly forbidden.<br />
<br />
      a. Exception: Determining options in the renegotiation of Peace<br />
	 agreements requires an action of acceptance or war to exit the<br />
	 bargain screen. This may be done but the game must be immediately<br />
	 closed without saving.<br />
<br />
I. The constitution, laws and standards of Fanatica can never be contrary <br />
   to the rules and regulations of the Civfanatics forums. Moderators may <br />
   veto/correct any such items.</div></div><hr />

               replaced on a case-by-case basis by the Chief Justice. <br />
               This replacement is for that case only. If the Chief <br />
               Justice is under investigation, the President shall <br />
               determine the replacement.<br />

	        post in 2.B.		<br />
	       i.   If the Investigation cannot be concluded in that time <br />
	            period, a post should be made in the Judicial Thread <br />
	            stating the reason for the delay.<br />
	       ii.  If such a post is not made, and the time expires, the <br />

	        determine the sentence for the accused.<br />
	       i.   Each vote shall be determined as a vote for the option <br />
	            selected, and all less-severe options.<br />

               Option C has 29 total votes.  A total of 29 citizens <br />

               a majority of the citizens support with a total of 16 <br />
               votes in support and 29 votes overall.<br />

<br />
B. Code of Laws Amendments<br />
	1. Amendments to the Code of Laws must receive the vote of a <br />
plurality of the citizenry that choose to vote and the vote of a majority<br />
of the full Senate before they take effect.  The quorum for a citizen poll is<br />
1/3 of the citizens who voted in the most active poll in the most recent full elections.<br />
		a. If the number of votes divided by 3 is a decimal, it is <br />
rounded up if the decimal is above .5 and down if it is .5 or smaller.<br />
	2. A Code of Laws amendment may also pass by receiving superplurality <br />
(double the votes for Yes than in any other option) support by the citizenry.  <br />
If this happens, the Senate poll is skipped and the amendment goes into <br />
effect immediately.<br />
	3. A CoL amendment citizen poll must be open for at least 48 <br />
hours for the amendment to take effect.</div></div><hr />
