<br />
I just wanted to say at what a pleasant game this is; the first emporer level game that I haven't been wiped out or given up in BC.  The geography of the island has allowed me to fill it nicely. I was pissed when I was beaten to every possible wonder (including Hanging Gardens ONE TURN before I should have had it).  I have only encountered the Japanese so far, but they are friendly and selling me tech.<br />
<br />
Such a nice one compared to GOTM 3 I believe, the one where you start as the Greeks and the Romans show up and kick your butt immediately.  That was the last time I tried GOTM and it was so frustrating I haven't gone back since.  But I will stick this out. <br />
<br />
Please don't bother replying to this thread.</div></div><hr />

First, you ARE allowed to participate in the SPOILER thread, WHEN you more or less know the whole world.<br />
<br />
Second, when making threads as this, please include a SPOILER in the title.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />
