It was to basic, repetive, and eventually annoying. I felt as though it distracted me, especially since I was used to the quiet game like in Civ 1. <br />
<br />
But lately I found its fun to play mp3's or use a nearby cd player. The music really helps set the mood. <br />
<br />
My favorite is Pink Floyd, (I find the Wall works particulary well on 2194 days of war.)<br />
<br />
Anways, anyone have any good suggestions for songs or songtracks to listen to while playing.</div></div><hr />

Tool tops my list, although Godsmack has been fulfilling my anger management needs for awhile now http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/cool.gif</div></div><hr />

Well, it must be close to the Armageddon. Lord, you know that I won’t fly by that lesson you taught me, to pull out my Wesson you brought me, and i’m not stressin’ it softly. Get ‘em up off me, ‘cause all we wanted harmony, been bombin’ ‘em. Yell up outta my ghetto, “I won’t settle,” get on my level.</div></div><hr />
