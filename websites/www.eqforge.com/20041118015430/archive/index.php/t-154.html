<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">duennbrettbohrer</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2001, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the &quot;extreme hostility&quot; towards Civ. One ist  quite a sensible thing. Common sense tells us that an however improved AI will NEVER be as good as an experienced human player, so it's quite likely that the human will be far ahead in most games. There are MANY examples in history for what happens when a nation becomes too powerful and too obviously expansionist: There will be -as like as not-an universal alliance against it: see WW1, the napoleonic wars, the history of ancient Athens a.s.o. A big and rich nation will also incite jealousy and greed, as Rome did, and thus become a target for raids (especially technology ist easy to steal in Civ2). To conclude, it makes sense for the AI players to unite, since an appeasement strategy is known to be disastrous in the long run, see WW2. Expansionist civs will conquer you in the end, no matter how well you behave if they are not checked in time.<br />
 In that light, it even makes some sense for small nations to attack without provocation even if they themselves are destroyed by the inevitable counteroffensive, since they can do some damage and force Civ1 to deploy troops which might weaken the defence by a significant margin, enough for the allies to break through elsewhere. Of course, this only works if there was some sort of coordination of attack strategies between allies, which of course doesnt yet exist in civ.</div></div><hr />

It would be especially good if they can coordinate their attacks with the human as well as against the human player.  Asking another civ to declare war is pointless in civ2.<br />

<br />
We see it all around us... The US for instance is a major superpower but also a major trading partner for all that does business with it. <br />
<br />
Much of western europe lived under the protection of the American Nuclear umbrella during the cold war. And you can't say that the US armed forces didn't make a great contribution to the second World War.<br />
<br />
Israel also finds a valuable ally in the United States... they're surrounded by a sea of insanity and the US has mostly sided with the Jewish State over that Arab nations...<br />
<br />
In short it's GOOD to have friends with big sticks... The AI can't see that for some reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if the computer coordinated attacks against you, that would at least make the game *slightly challenging.   also, i think it's stupid when you are the most powerful, and the #7 on the power chart keeps sneak-attacking you, all by themselves.  (that's happining in a game i am currently playing on either prince or king... i don't remember)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CoolUserName</div><div class="date">Mar 28, 2001, 12:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point - I hope they included that in civ III.</div></div><hr />

I always feel like laughing when they say, &quot;Well, if you give us 10,000 gold...&quot; Yeah right!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tact</div><div class="date">Mar 28, 2001, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No it doesn't exist in an AI civ, but I'll tell you the alliance of human players in a Civ game is such a beautiful thing. Cooperation and compromise, lies, betrayal, it's almost like running your own country...(of course that would be the point of the game, but it becomes so much more +HUMAN FACTOR)</div></div><hr />
