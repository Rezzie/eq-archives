<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Jun 14, 2002, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">philippe, you need to include a &quot;spoilers&quot; listing in the title for this thread and mention it relates to GOTM8. I'm not giving out my timeframe dates at the moment, so I'll just tell you it was &quot;early middle ages&quot;. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sense that the initial response to the idea of key event polls is very positive.<br />
<br />
Most people have no interest in wading through another spoiler discussion list and trying to make sense of all the random individual posts.<br />
<br />
Try to think through a carefully worded poll that would allow your question to be answered in the concise summarized format of a poll. If people want to chat with you or provide more details they can then extend the thread. If they just want to see a summary of the answers, then the poll will give them that result.<br />
<br />
For the record, posting a good poll is not a matter of just spewing forth the first things that fall out of one of the holes in your head. A reasonable poll should try not to predetermine the outcome of the poll and the answer choices of the poll should cover the reasonably expected outcomes. Most polls that are posted without some pre-thought end up missing the real point.<br />
<br />
I think the question you were asking had a good place as an additional spoiler poll, but you may have seen those examples and then missed the point that they were polls and not just another chat thread.<br />
<br />
Also the point about making sure to separate spoiler information if you elect to post the topics before the end of the submission is very important. It would be better to say nothing until after the end of the month if there was any risk that you would spoil someone elses potential enjoyment of the game.<br />
Good luck,</div></div><hr />
