<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">May 21, 2003, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, now that the clasification is done, Its time to clasify everyone.<br />
<br />
 WHO WE KNOW OF NOW <br />
Abe of the Americans<br />
Alex of the Greeks<br />
Cleo of the Egyptians<br />
<br />
 WE KNOW EXISTS BUT ARE YET TO MEET <br />
Monty of the Aztecs<br />
<br />
Now, as reminder, here are the clasifications:<br />
<br />
 A Carthage : A Carthage-esque civilization is a bitter enemy of ours. We will not stop until we destroy this civ. They are our sworn enemy, and they deserved it. They have either attacked us or done something horrible against us.<br />
<br />
 A Jerusalem: A Jerusalem type civilization is a civ which has become victim of our might. We take them over, sometimes without reason.<br />
<br />
 A Gaul : A long term enemy. Similar to a Carthage, but this involves advance plans with multiple fronts and a larger amounts of units. We may not necessarily destroy this civ.<br />
<br />
 An Italia - A constant ally. We just seem to like these guys. We would, normally, help them out. We get them on our side in most wars.<br />
<br />
 A Persia - We are yet to kill these guys. We are at peace with them, but who knows when it may break?<br />
<br />
A Goth- This nation we get along with, now. We dont know what will happen if we turn the other way on them, but we hope it wont result in the Middle Ages.<br />
<br />
Before I release my opinions on everyone, I want to hear some discussions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">May 21, 2003, 05:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say all of them for Goths or Persians, maybe Jerusalem. In my opinion we should give it a turn-chat or two and see where we are then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">May 21, 2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would agree that until we have built up a better knowledge of these people and have had a few dealings with them, we should classify them as Goths/Persians.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">May 21, 2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We should wait, yes. That is a deffinate.<br />
Eventually, however, we will most likely go to war with them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plexus</div><div class="date">May 22, 2003, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What we can infer<br />
<br />
Greece: They're in trouble. If they are already resorting to building in Jungle, you know that have crappy land.<br />
<br />
Egypt: They have great land, and are expanding quickly. Could be a threat due to cultural tendacies.</div></div><hr />
