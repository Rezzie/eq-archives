<br />
In order to make the Civiliopedia work with your new tech tree and city improvements, units, wonders etc., you must remove the file &quot;Get info.exe&quot; from the pedia folder.<br />
<br />
A good way to edit city improvements and wonders etc, is to alter the &quot;pedia.txt&quot; in the civ folder, as you design the tech tree. It makes one aware of many things that need to be accustomed to the scenario, regarding what effects improvements and wonders have, in combination with civ advances.<br />

I suppose you're talking about ToT???<br />
Because in other civ, there is no pedia folder... only a pedia.txt...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2001, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The version I have is the original Civ2 -however I don't know which version of the original that is.<br />
<br />
But there is both a &quot;Pedia&quot; folder (which is installed with the full installation), that contains the A-Z index of the game, as well as detailed descriptions, pictures (supposedly the &quot;.apr&quot;-files), etc of the civ advances, units etc, AND a &quot;pedia.txt&quot;.<br />
<br />
The &quot;pedia.txt&quot; is placed in the main folder of the game, and can easily be altered.<br />
The thing that buggered me, was that I wanted the Civilopedia to show how my new tech tree worked out. If you remove the &quot;Getinfo.exe&quot; program from the Pedia folder, it seems like CIV2 gets the information from &quot;pedia.txt&quot; -otherwise it seems to get it from the pedia folder!<br />
<br />
I don't know how this works with TOT or other versions of the game. I suppose with some other versions, the game supremely gets the info from &quot;pedia.txt&quot; and you won't have this problem.<br />
<br />
The catch with removing &quot;getinfo.exe&quot;, is that you no longer can get instant info on the terrain, it seems. But that is a minor problem, I think.<br />
