<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fossil</div><div class="date">Mar 11, 2002, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The current rules for GOTM prohibit adding workers to a city's population in order to pop-rush units.  I assume that the prohibition also applies to city improvements.<br />
<br />
With the 1.17 patch, it appears that this exploit has been fixed.   I therefore suggest that this prohibition be lifted for future GOTM's.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your consideration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beard Rinker</div><div class="date">Mar 11, 2002, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My understanding is there is no restriction on pop-rushing city improvements, including adding workers to do so.  The rules even state you can pop-rush units in an emergency situation.  <br />
<br />
The restriction applies to using cities to convert workers into units to build up your military.  This differs from an 'emergency pop-rush' as you are building up an offensive army not desparately trying to save a that city.  <br />
<br />
The 1.17 patch does fix this exploit mostly, but there are still ways around it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read a post that if you disband the city, unhappiness gets transferred to another city.  <br />
<br />
You might be able to pop a barracks, a couple of units, then give the city to another civ.  That might work (but I have not tried it).  Then raze it when you take it back.  <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if that whole exercise really advances your cause much, or has been reduced to a strategem that is helpful only if your back is to the wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 11, 2002, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Designating a city as a military camp and using workers or captured workers to produce units can still be very powerful.  The city can produce a unit every other turn in an area that would otherwise be limited to 1 shield per turn.  You can't disband the city anymore, but you can keep it as a size 1 specialist city to contain the unhappiness buildup.  There really isn't a penalty if it is dealt with this way, the only loss is the 1 tile that the city uses.  Even then you still get credit for it along with the specialist from a scoring standpoint.<br />
<br />
If this restriction was removed from the GOTM's, then pop rushing would become the most powerful production method once again.</div></div><hr />

I guess an entertainer never gets unhappy. Maybe they always have sufficent recreational substances to keep them smiling:crazyeyes :crazyeyes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a powerful exploit to build workers, join them to entertainer cities, and pop them for units.  A decent city can produce workers every five turns, a food city can produce workers every three or four turns.  Captured workers can also be joined and then popped to produce units.  This is the most efficient way to produce military units in version 1.17f.  However, it is an exploit and not permitted in GOTM.<br />
<br />
Firaxis has several options for an easy fix to the remaining loophole.  A one turn delay after joining before popping, fixes the worst of it.</div></div><hr />
