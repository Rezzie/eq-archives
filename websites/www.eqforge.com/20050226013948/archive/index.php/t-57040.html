Talk to Chinese:<br />
They want sanitation, no. Ask to exchange techs, but they are too focused on building Magellan's.:(  Exchange maps though.<br />
Taxes set to 70%.<br />

Decides to rush one MP this turn: BBF for 138g.<br />

<br />
Dou elephant gets the barb outside LC. <br />
The other two are bribed for 82g each.<br />
Prod planning: One is supported by LC (which had a prod of 11s before). The other is stationed in Neu.<br />
<br />
LP trireme starts trip with Dou dye to Knossos.<br />
<br />
Three caravans are delivered to Dou:<br />
Demanded VM silver: 170g/b, TR 6t/turn.<br />
BS silver: 24 g/b, TR 4t/turn.<br />
Ipec Dye: 58g/b, TR 6t/turn.<br />
<br />
RB FW aque: about 120g.<br />
RB BP MP: 144g.<br />
RB Nemo settler.<br />
<br />
I see that we can make RF a 10s city, and still celebrate it up to 12, by just rearranging some workers and let BS support its trireme. Since RF is supposed to build settlers until we have all the wonders I go through with this.<br />
<br />
Wonder update: 12 caravans are waiting in Neu and one from LC is on the way. Next turn Neu and RF will complete two caravans. The turn after that LC (+cash), EF (+cash), LP and Dou will complete caravans. This means that if we want to we can complete two wonders in a row in Neu, i.e. in two turns and 3 turns. <br />
<br />
After a check with the other civs' tech lists I see that no one has monotheism yet, but the French are discovering it. Still, the French will have to discover two techs and complete a wonder (and it's quite unlikely they chose this path) before we have accumulated enough money or caravans to finish the third wonder, which shouldn't take too many more turns after the 2 first are built. Conclusion: Let's build Leo's and Adam's over the next three turns.<br />
<br />

EF and LC will have two in two turns (LC van reaching Neu in 3 turns like Dou van). Neu itself will build a van in three turns. Total of 8 caravans in Neu in three turns. Most of the other caravans are now switched to something else. Courthouses if improvement. FW is almost done with its caravan and therefore it gets to build it, but we'll store it for future wonders since FW doesn't supply anything.<br />

<br />
Things to consider:<br />
We finally have engineers, what difficult tasks shall we give them? Maybe we should try to get rid of that polluting mine in the middle of our 2,8 million city? One should found a city north of RF on green?<br />
<br />
We practically have all the wonders we need and should definitely jack up luxury in a turn or two. So, what tax rates?<br />
<br />
We're researching chivalry, our enemies have chivalry and we have a boat and a dip within a turn from their city... shall we?<br />
<br />
I've started a few courthouses, is it what we need? We don't have any blackies, so we'll need them before we discover RR and they'll help now too. Well, building queues in general.<br />
<br />
Science, what shall we go for next?<br />
<br />
We have a bunch of money, shall we spend them on improvements like MPs, banks and sewers?<br />
<br />
I realized too late that I should've talked to the indians about navigation, I'm sorry.:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 27, 2003, 07:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finishing wonders using caravans only can take too much time, mainly because of travelling time. I think we should finish both Bach and Magellan in the next two turns:<br />
<br />
Finish the caravan being built in Neu and next turn dump all required food caravans (and commodity caravans from cities with 3 trade routes; send the others to Dou) into Neu to finish Bach. In RF we should either rush buy now what we are building or even switch to engineers and IPRB them. Next turn we should start Magellan, dump the nearby caravans into it and use cash for what remains to finish it. This means that two turns from now we will have finished those wonders we want and be ready to start celebrating (I'd like to build SOL as well but IIRC no AI civ has discovered democracy so it can wait a few turns). To do this we would set taxes again to 70% since we have now discovered explosives (a very valuable tech) and magnetism (also valuable). 2 turns from now tax/sci/lux would be changed again and luxuries increased greatly.<br />
<br />
We should use any extra cash not required for Magellan to rush buy stuff in FJ, BP and maybe BBF.<br />
<br />
Building courthouses makes sense.<br />
<br />
Regarding engineers, we should start changing jungles and swamps to something more useful. We'll also found a city on Coresux' northern tip soon. And we need more engineers, a problem I plan to address soon, we should possibly rush buy 2-5 engineers within 5 turns. More irrigation is needed ASAP near PB, BS and LC.<br />
<br />
Needless to say we should steal chivalry.<br />
<br />
The barbarian incident shows that we need to strengthen the defenses in western Coresux the moment we have time to do so. Neu needs musketeers.<br />
<br />
Refrigeration is starting to become an appealing tech.<br />
<br />
Now that we have AS we maybe should start giving consideration to libraries. And barracks to prepare invading Greece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jun 27, 2003, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Barracks cost 2g now that we have gunpowder. Every time they become obsolete the cost increases with 1g. Still barracks are a good idea if we plan to build up defense or some attack units for Hell.<br />
<br />
We also lost one settler in the barb attack, which is why I didn't found the city sooner. The plan would've been to use the settler north of RF to found it and replace it with the dead settler. Since we couldn't replace the settler, I figured making sure RF had food for celebrations (at least the buffalo) was a bit more important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2003, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll probably play next on Monday, but Tuesday could be okay too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I strongly prefer Tuesday to give people more time to vote. Given past experience, very few people will probably have voted tomorrow (Monday). Also on Tuesday there will be 5 days since you last played and 5-7 days between playing seems nice now that the empire is much more complicated to run than it was in the early years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few miscellaneous issues:<br />
<br />
(1) We need a new science plan in the not too distant future. Getting refrigeration would be nice as well as railroad and then metallurgy (cannons travelling along railroads in Hell !).<br />
<br />
(2) I'm not an expert in unblocking caravan commodities - what needs to be done to enable Dou to produce commodity caravans again ?<br />
<br />
(3) Should we start paying attention to building libraries in the biggest cities shortly after we have celebrated ?<br />
<br />
(4) We should start irrigating jungle squares in Coresux. Also mining the coal near Superstorms should be done sooner or later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) We'll need to celebrate before getting railroad, because it cancels the effect of HG. Although it'll take longer to develop tactics, I think it'll be easier with cavalry than with cannons.<br />
<br />
2) I'm not an expert at this either, but I think delivering food caravans for wonders will free a commodity.<br />
<br />
3) With Adam making them free, yes.<br />
<br />
4) The coal could really speed things up in that city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, we should delay railroad until the end of the celebrations (my message also implied this by putting refrigeration ahead of RR).<br />
<br />
The reason I wanted metallurgy is that we need units as 'cannon fodder' :D and cannons are much cheaper than cavalry. By this I  am referring to the units that start an attack against a city and thus get the toughest resistance and may die as a result. Of course cavalry would be highly useful as well.<br />
<br />
Three issues I forgot to mention in the message above:<br />
<br />
(5) We need a galleon near BP to ferry caravans. The galleon NE of Naer should maybe head there despite the galleon in Superstorms (having two galleons in this war zone is useful for ferrying military stuff and caravans). The galleon W of Ipec can head E and then N to explore N and NE of VM.<br />
<br />
(6) We should steal chivalry from the Greeks. And before stealing check what it costs to bribe Thessalonica even though we are not allowed to bribe.<br />
<br />
(7) LC still has food problems. So irrigate, irrigate ! The suggested build queue for PB has an engineer as top priority to address this. Also one of the engineers near RF probably should be sent there since unlike LC RF has a big food surplus.</div></div><hr />
