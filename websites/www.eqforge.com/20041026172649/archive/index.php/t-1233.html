I know that just when I think I have explored just about everything that can be done, something else pops up and I'm in a different file making changes....tell me about some of the things that you've found can be 'changed' that you discovered to be useful in your modpack or scenario...I changed everything from the graphics to the attributes of the terrain and remixed the sounds...but I know there are still things I've never seen before.<br />
<br />
Also, what is it that you do to make the scenario more enjoyable, do you think graphics or sounds or both are more important? Or maybe you just focus on units. What do you think?<br />

I try do make the same in my own scns, so I always change the units as well as icons, citys, people, terrains and so on. <br />
<br />
Tricks? Hmm, I wouldn´t call it so, but some of the freeware tools for Civ2 can save a lot of work, for instance Mercators new MapEdit.   http://forums.civfanatics.com/wink.gif<br />

<br />
I know that multiple events files can be very helpful to get desired effects. I've usually just used 'one events' file because most of the scenarios I do are sci-fi and I just need a few changes to the terrain or the creation of a few units.<br />
<br />
Something else, I've been able to change the attributes of terrain (along with the graphics) to create certain unusual changes...such as: I created a scenario that makes volcanoes if you try to mine specific terrains...kinda like Dorian Crede's changing water to land idea. <br />
<br />
Another thing I've been working with recently is to change every single sound file. I've found that to achieve a new atmosphere the following sound files are an absolute must to change:<br />
<br />
menuok.wav<br />
menuend.wav<br />
menuloop.wav<br />
movpiece.wav<br />
neg1.wav<br />
pos1.wav<br />
<br />
Changing the fanfares can be helpful depending upon the scenario and of course this is in addition to changing the unit sounds. I intend to experiment with the drum*.wavs soon, just to see what kind of effects I can get. <br />

<br />
If you are talking about units that do not have movement points I hear ya...I've started to encorporate them into my scenarios only recently. <br />
<br />
=========<br />
<br />
I can tell everyone that you can really change the dynamics of defense for the entire game depending upon if you decide to adjust the rules for the game...such as if you make an immobile unit free for the fundamentalist govt., then you have to remember that the computer can use that edge as well, hehe.<br />
<br />
Now, another thing that you can do with units is experiment with their movement configurations to change their properties...I've created appropriate movement mostly for sci-fi units but I've been experimenting with movement rates and fueling. I'd like to know anyone has discovered anything new for these options.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stefan Haertel</div><div class="date">Jan 01, 2001, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One nice idea to improve the scenario's gameplay is to try and change the scenario's objective.<br />
For example:<br />
-Only one city becomes objective. All other civs (except for the agressor) are destroyed. This can be very fun when two or more civs are competing for the goal (e.g. in a multiplayer game) or, like in my 3d Punic War scenario, when the civ must defend this city.<br />
-Same with special units or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Jan 01, 2001, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Stefan,<br />
<br />
That's a great concept. It's that inverse thinking...rather than a lot of city objectives...just one city to protect...great idea! To be honest, I have over 200 scenarios on my hard drive and I know 3rd Punic is one of them...I am going to check that one out!<br />
<br />
Also, I found that it can be fun to destroy a civ if a certain objective or tech is acquired; it's a command in events that can shock the player, especially if another civ gets the objective or tech first.<br />
<br />
Cool,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stefan Haertel</div><div class="date">Jan 02, 2001, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can also try making a scenario in which the objective is to pursuit or fight only one enemy. I.e. an Alexander the Great scenario in which the objective is to track down and kill either Darius, Bessos or Spitamenes, or an end-of-all battle of Berlin WW2 scen in which the objective would be to track down nazi officers (hey, I should suggest this to some guys at Apolyton http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif)</div></div><hr />

Qin forces have to search and destroy enemies' ancestral temples and destroy them in order to estinguish the whole state - but i combined this idea with classic objectives' goals: before doing that, you must conquer all of the state important cities, otherwise you'll fail your mission... and i added a few more units to spice up the whole game ( generals, princes, stuff like that... )</div></div><hr />

Just one to say (in a general sense): get &quot;CivCity&quot; now! Wondefully labour-saving.<br />
<br />
JValdezToo, I did some research into the fanfares and drums for my last scenario. It's not a complete list but I can post what I found. For a complete list you'd need to test all 21 civ slots, and I only did the first 7.<br />

<br />
...that could be particularly useful for scenario ideas...<br />
<br />
here's another one...try fooling around with the costs of certain units...make them over 20 and see what happens...in some unit slots you get a &quot;negative&quot; cost in the game...build the unit and IT GIVES YOU MONEY!<br />
<br />
That could be cool in say...a capitalistic scenario....businesses competing against each other and so on...<br />
<br />
Actually, if somebody wanted to...they could map that out and posted in the downloads section if somebody was interested...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hanti</div><div class="date">Feb 12, 2001, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As for these &quot;negative&quot; costs in the game - it could be very annoying if you not made it for some reason. For MGE it's 127 that is still &quot;positive&quot; cost for unit (means 1270 gp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Feb 12, 2001, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's interesting Hanti. I was not aware that these differences varied from version to version. This thread has turned out to be one of the best. I think there are a lot of possibilities for future scenarios...<br />
<br />
There was another thing I was wondering about. How much does anyone here know about what can be done with the file: menu.txt<br />
<br />
I've tweaked it a little...but I'm wondering if there is any way to actually change the key strokes that give you the pull down menus. All I've been able to do is change the name of individual menus. If I change WORLD to QUADRANT, then you still have to press alt+w to pull it down...not that people don't just use their mouse anyway...but it would be nice if I could make a more complete change.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prometeus</div><div class="date">Feb 13, 2001, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hanti, be careful... more then 18 shield rows can cause sudden crashes or malfunctions to the game.<br />
Another trick:  the nuclear weapon factor starts at 80 attack points. 79 is the highest normal attack point you can reach without Manhattan wonder... So i planned to create a neutronic bomb for a Gundam scen i was working at ( in this cartoon series, there was a &quot;South Pole threatry&quot; that banished chemical, biological and nuclear weapons forever...) . The idea worked, but Sunrise sued to not create this scen because of copyrights, so I got fried the whole scen. But for another sci-fi might be interesting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hanti</div><div class="date">Feb 13, 2001, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use MGE patch 3.<br />
AFAIK MGE has eliminated &quot;negative&quot; gold.<br />
So If you set 128 as a value you can buy a unit with NONE cost - means you will NOT earn any dime. But still don't have to pay for building a unit (in pedia cost is shawn as NONE). I thin you can easily set it to 127 without a crash - but I didn't test it (used this value for an unbuildable unique units to prevent bribing them).</div></div><hr />

^Forest, hill, and mountain icons each have 16 different orientations to<br />
