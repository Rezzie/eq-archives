<br />
But Cartouche´s win with more than the DOUBLE amount of points is &quot;interesting&quot;. :eek:<br />
An absolute must for a download, that will be worth a look. I guess he used the worker dogpile exploit én masse.<br />
<br />
Anyway, congrats to all.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

I missed GOTM8.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">4th place, eh? This was the first game I played for score in some time, and only half-heartedly at that. Looks like I'm a better player than I think. :)<br />
<br />
If you're thinking, &quot;How did he get that score?&quot; you can read my game report at http://www.geocities.com/lcsullla/Civ3page</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congrats to all who were able to play!<br />
<br />
I'm glad we have stopped the worker dogpiles. But if you look at my last post in the GOTM8 spoiler, I had a score of about 11,000 even without any points for specialists. So without the dogpiles I would have probably still scored in the 13,000 to 14,000 range ( normally, specialists will probably be a little less than half of the happy total, without dogpiles). This high score is a side effect of a early ICS build which brings your total population of happy citizens up very quickly.<br />

<br />
For diplomacy, it is awarded by highest score, not speed.  I bet el rey didn't think he would receive an award!<br />
<br />
Congrats to all the players :goodjob: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phillip_martin</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 09:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey,<br />
<br />
The lowest score for a Victory. Must be worth some Kudos :blush: <br />
<br />
Maybe an honorary award from the Anti-Milking League :lol:<br />
<br />
Congrats to all who participated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Placed 13th and that moved me up to 14th in the global ranking yippy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawrence</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congrats to all players!<br />
<br />
And only finished 10 turns later than SirPleb to get a spaceship victory is a big honor to me!:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 03:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a bad game for a change. http://www.straland.com/images/smilies/undecided.gif<br />
<br />
But this month I'm doing well (except for the fact that I had bad luck with huts), so perhaps I get a score above average this time. :rolleyes: That's my only goal and I only succeeded once in that...with the warlord GOTM. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kemal</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finished 24th, entering the global ranking at a modest 105th place. :)<br />
<br />
Congrats to all who finished the game.<br />
<br />
SirPleb, Lawrence: VERY quick spaceship victories indeed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">col</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Matrix - try going for the new challenge...<br />
<br />
The LOWEST scoring victory of any kind. <br />
(credit to Phil M - I think its a GREAT idea!)<br />
<br />
Could be a tense race between a few of us (until SirPleb thinks it sounds like fun....)<br />
<br />
(I've already submitted GOTM9 and scored way too much to be last and far too few to appear very high on the tables...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hergrom</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ha, finally scored higher than SirPleb!  A moral victory, but still a victory....<br />
<br />
Special kudos to Valeri Kouznetsov.  Fantastic early finish!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fossil</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, I did pretty well this time. Gotta say, I had so much fun milking :rolleyes: that my appearance near the top probably won't happen again anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Congrats to all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NHJ BV</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm last! ;) <br />
<br />
Im not used to the higher difficulty levels...:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to see the moderator(or moderators) take a quick look at some of the key event polls for the GOTMs and then link them in near the beginning of the results page.<br />
<br />
This is not because I posted most of the key events polls to start with, but because I feel these polls make a great summary of some of the spects of the game that would not be available in other forms without a great deal of human effort.<br />
<br />
For GOTM8, the key event polls were:<br />
<br />
How did you make contact with the civs on the second continent? (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=24687) <br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
What was the final score for Russia in your game? (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=24686) <br />
<br />
The fact that 38 people responded to the contact poll and almost 50% of those respondents indicated that they traded for contact with the the other continent is a very interesting result.<br />
<br />
The poll about Russia's score only had 34 respondents but it also contained a good distribution of responses that showed people did not necessarily just wail the tar out of Cathy to be successful.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to urge better participation in these types of polls to get the coverage of the data up to about 60 to 80% of the submitted game files. This would be very educational.<br />
<br />
I should also acknowledge that I was not 100% ignoring Phillipe's poll attempts here, but I do not think he really grasped the objective of the polls since one of the examples was just a blind repeat of the victory type submission.<br />
<br />
Putting together functional polls for the special events is a little bit tough to do, but I think we should encourage this process by perhaps making this task one of the perks/pains or winning a prior GOTM or winning a medal in a prior GOTM. Definately do not want to put more work on Matrix since he does so much already, but I see some real opportunity to expand the group discussion potential of the GOTMs by using these key event polls as a basis for thought.</div></div><hr />
