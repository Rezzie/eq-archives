<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it is more important to build a Settler in Gorina, so that we can quickly claim our land.  Building a new city will give us even more opportunity to build Workers in the future.  Plus it will allow us to continually devote a city to Settler production.  The more cities we get, the easier this becomes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Almightyjosh</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It may be that later down the track we will move our capital to a better location, but for now we are stuck with it so we should endevour to give it a functioning, ney, booming economy and growth :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although i would like to see another tile in the Girina area irrigated, I have no problem shipping the worker off to Noshuret. But as far as production, I must agree with DZ. As I have stated in the Gorina City Thread (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=979734#post979734), a settler could be completed in 10 turns and then we can think about another Worker when our population permits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're about to build our 3rd city, too, so we definately need workers. Domestic says that we are in a near to urgent need of workers (again). Do we want a recreation of the DG2 worker situation? (mid game)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CT, if we are en route to building our 3rd city, what is wrong with a 4th?  Let's build it now so that we will have more cities to produce workers with.  <br />
<br />
For the next 20-30 turns, I would like to us be on a cycle where every city produces either a Settler or Worker upon reaching Size 3.  Except for Noshuret, of course, which would take too long to replenish the population.  With more cities, we should be able to accomplish this, as well as expand our military.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One idea which would consume some extra shields but  speed the pace of settlement would be to build a worker before each settler and send it roading ahead of where the settler will go. This could be done using a pair of factory towns, one for settlers and the other for alternating worker / warrior.<br />
<br />
The warrior, worker, warrior, (stuff to wait for growth), settler pattern will take longer for an individual town to build its settler, but provides a more balanced alternative if we follow it only in the border towns, to cut down on movement penalty.  Expand at the edges and build more advanced things in the center...<br />
<br />
In either case, need a general balance between settlement pace, improvement pace, military, and buildings.  :hammer:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">May 15, 2003, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Workers are a must. We need a lot of them. So I say that the workers should do I lot of Irrigating Becasue this would happen:<br />
<br />
Irrigation gives food. Food Gives Workers. Workers give more irrigation, and so on.<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
Irrifation Gives food. Food Gives Settlers. Settlers Give new citys. New citys gives more places to irrigate and thereby even more food wich gives more settlers and workers and so it goes on...  <br />
<br />
So I say that we definitivly should do some irrigating....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">May 15, 2003, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Irrigation is not a high priority at this point because we are in Despotism.  The only city that can currently benefit from irrigation right now is Noshuret, which would increase plains output from 1 food to 2.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but the benefits of irrigating grasslands would not be seen until we enter a more advanced government.<br />
<br />
So let's lay the foundation for a great nation by building as many cities as we can now.  When we become a Monarchy(or Republic), we can roll out the workers and go nuts.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">May 15, 2003, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even tough I dont like to admit it. I would have to say that your proposal, dz, is better then mine... :D</div></div><hr />
