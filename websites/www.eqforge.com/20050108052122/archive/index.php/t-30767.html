I went into PC World.  They sold 2-port USB cards for £30 but had none in stock.  With it being somewhat urgent for me to get this card I decided to try the teeny weeny computer shop across the road.  They had plenty of 2-port USB cards - and only £12! they were identical to the ones in PC World.  I think this just shows how much you can get ripped off in the big computer stores.   Hmmmm...i think i'll treat myself with the extra cash i now have<br />

I always pre-search and make calls before buying anything so I don't get ripped off too badly. $12 is quite a bargain!</div></div><hr />

Great job! I always pre-search and make calls before buying anything so I don't get ripped off too badly. $12 is quite a bargain! £12 = approx. $18.  Still - not too bad!</div></div><hr />
