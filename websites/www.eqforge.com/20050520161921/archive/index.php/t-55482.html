<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We currently have a Settler en route to the Gold Rush area south of Gorina, and another due from Penguinadua in 2 turns.  As these cities will be the first to be named this term, we will have to decide if city naming will be term-based or chronological, or a combination of both.<br />
<br />
Term-based<br />
<br />
City naming starts at the top of Term 2's Chain of Command and works through all leaders and deputies.  After this, Term 1's leaders and deputies that did not get to name a city woulld be next(according to its CoC), followed  the the Fanatican citizens.<br />
<br />
Chronological<br />
<br />
From last term, the only elected officials that did not get to name a city were Judge Advocate Fionn McCumhall and Public Defender bootstoots.  After this, there are also six deputies in the hierarchy(one deputy held a higher position and got to name a city).<br />
<br />
Chronological would have Term 1's leaders and deputies name a city first before moving to term 2's CoC.<br />
<br />
Combination<br />
<br />
This would have Term 1's leaders first in the hierarchy, followed by Term 2's CoC, then Term 1's deputies and then the Fanatican citizenry.<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Which of these methods do you prefer?  Is there an even better way?  Let's try to hammer this out by the beginning of Tuesday's chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2003, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would prefer the chronological order rather than any other.  Fionn and I should not be recycled to the bottom of the CoC for naming cities simply because a city was not named for either of us this term.  Also, we should have people who have already named a city before not name one again until the entire populace that wants a city has named one.  When we run out of elected officials, the Fanatican citizenry become eligible to name a city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2003, 06:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoa, Mr. President. The Historical process of city-naming has always been fairly simple and well excepted throughout our journeys through time. I suggest we stick with that routine to ensure consistant equality in the COC naming process.<br />
<br />
In a first Term of a demogame, the people at the top of the COC are the first to name cities. After they name a city they are removed from the eligibility list for naming a city until all citizens have named a city. When Term 1 ends, the process starts over and the people at the top of the COC begin naming cities first, UNLESS they have already named a city. Then they are bypassed and then they person below them gets to name a city, UNLESS they have named a city, and so on...<br />
<br />
If you were at the bottom of the COC at the end of the last Term and did not get to name a city, you lose out. You must place yourself again on the COC in order to be considered eligible for priority placing. Otherwise, you must wait like everyone else. Let's say you were a deputy or a Governor  or whatever in Term 1 and you didn't get to name a city. In Term Two you find yourself in approximately the same level of the COC, but most of the positions above you are filled with people who have already named a city. This situation would actually put you close to the top of the city-naming COC, as most of the people above you would be ineligible to name a city again until everyone else had.<br />
<br />
But, if the begining of the last scenario was true and someone at the bottom of the COC didn't get to name a city, and then they did not return to political office (therefore placing them in the upper COC) then they would be placed in order of their registration number, just like everyone else who didn't hold political office.<br />
<br />
I can't see changing horses mid-stream. As we've already named a good 10-12 cities using the existing format, I believe changing now would be unfair to the masses.<br />
<br />
Just so you know, DZ. As President of the second Term, you would be the first to name a city in this Term, UNLESS you have already named a city. But I don't think this is the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2003, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I beg to differ, Cyc.  I believe the DG2 Cartographic Office placed former office-holders(that did not get to name a city) before the rest of the citizenry, but after the current term's leaders.  In this case, a term-based hierarchy is what was followed.<br />
<br />
My apologies for not disclaiming the fact that one cannot name a second city until every citizen in Fanatica has done so.  This method is so instilled into all of Fanatica that I thought that was implied.<br />
<br />
Finally, I believe that we should continue with a term-based city naming process.  I just wanted to make sure that was how we wanted to go about it this game before I go naming the next city.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 10, 2003, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Xak Tsaroth was named by eyrei. Lake Asphinxia was named by CT in honor of Almightyjosh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eklektikos</div><div class="date">Jun 10, 2003, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lake Asphinxia is a prime candidate for renaming in my opinion. DG1 is long over, let's move on and be a bit more creative with our naming :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 10, 2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we've kind of jumped the track a bit here, but the point is CT had already named Gorina. The renaming of that city is of minimal impotortance to me compared to the abuse of the accepted standards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 10, 2003, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we need to rectify the situation by giving Lake Asphinxia over to Fionn to name.</div></div><hr />
