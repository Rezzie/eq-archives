   The Office of Scientific Research (OSR) is facing chaos today.  Having been un-opposed in the election for Science Advisor, Sir Leowind seems to have gone missing with the first day of his new term only tomorrow.  Accusations of magical spells keeping potential candadites from running have raised suspicions that Sir Leowind himself may be dabbling in the darker side of the sciences, and has perhaps succumbed fully to its evil lure.  Others point to the passing of his 40th birthday over the weekend as evidence that he has passed his prime and is no longer fit for the role, despite his past success in the position. Unconfirmed reports are also circulating that he has been bedridden with illness the past few days.  Calls to his house went unanswered.  <br />
<br />
   In a possible break in the story, a longtime aid to Sir Leowind has come forward stating that his personal calendar is quite full for the rest of the week and he will not be able to assume his duties until Monday next.  When pressed about these other matters and rumours, his response was, &quot;Sick? yes; birthday? yes; magic? Preposterous!&quot;  No other information was provided.<br />
<br />
   As no Deputy has been appointed for the OSR the situation is critical.  President Funxus may need to be called upon to appoint at least an interim Deputy Science Advisor until the mystery surrounding Sir Leowind can be unravalled.<br />
<br />
translation:  I've been ill, and busy out of town the rest of the week.  Don't have time to appoint a deputy.  Funxus, can you do that for me if there are any Science issues to deal with before next week?<br />
<br />
EDIT: I might get some time Thursday evening (West Coast, US) at work, but no guarantees :( )</div></div><hr />
