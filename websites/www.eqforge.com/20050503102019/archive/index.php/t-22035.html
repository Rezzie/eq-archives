This is my first GOTM, and I must say it's a very interesting experience.<br />
So...there were people complaining it was too easy before?<br />
Interesting.<br />
Just thought I'd say I have just got to 800AD and I am still around a bit...feeling good about myself.<br />
<br />
It's a tough one.</div></div><hr />

This is a tough one.</div></div><hr />

Do you mean at diety? Otherwise, a lot of people win the game. Check up at Gotm or HoF.<br />
<br />
The only way to lose in my case is to give big bonus to Ai (like in diety).<br />
<br />
Explain yourself please.</div></div><hr />

Sure, no problem :)<br />

Still had mentioned this was his/her first GOTM, so I thought I would respond in an encouraging way. This month's game is on Deity, and as a result few people are winning the game. As yet, only 4 people have indicated on the spoilers thread that they have won the game, although a few other players are coming close. My point was that even the most elite players are having some difficulties with the game (though probably less than I did). Do I normally expect a lot of losses? No, I don't, but on a Deity-level game something would be wrong if the majority of the people were winning without much trouble. Diety should be the realm where only the most elite players can consistently win games, and Civ3 delivers admirably in this respect.<br />
<br />
My goal was to make players who may be struggling feel better about themselves and realize how difficult this month's game will be to win. Although I did manage to win, things looked exceptionally bleak at times. I hope this will help those who are struggling in the game stay with it to the end, because even if you don't win you should still learn something from the game (I know I did!)  :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Still</div><div class="date">May 08, 2002, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is my first GOTM however, I would like to think I am a seasoned CIVer :crazyeye: - what ever that would mean.  Been playing since the first one and not looked back.  Liked Alpha Centauri but not Call to Power.<br />
<br />
I have been watching the GOTM appear over the last few months and then decided to have a go this month.<br />
(Mainly because my Championship Manager game crashed after two and a half good game years :mad: and didn't want to have to start again, so switched back to Civ3 for a change.)<br />
<br />
Anyway...Thank you Sullla for the warm words.  It's not looking so bleak at the moment...I'm not a complete novice, so I am having the sort of effect I would like.  I managed to win a few deity games on both of the previous CIVs, but this map is a real B***H.<br />
<br />
As I say, I am getting things moving in the game which is nice, so I am looking forward to seeing where I end up on the board.  Don't know if I'll win yet.  Who can say.<br />
<br />
He (me) will see you on the finals board.  :beer:</div></div><hr />

I suggest a moderator move it there if possible. :)</div></div><hr />

It's a tough one. <br />
<br />
Some of my most enjoyable games have been in tough, or even losing, positions.</div></div><hr />

Have I made a mistake.<br />
I have just realised today that I post an entirely new thread, and not post a reply.<br />
As I said...first time.<br />
<br />
If I did mess oop, then huge apologies to the moderators...I am learning the system.<br />
<br />
Cheers.<br />
