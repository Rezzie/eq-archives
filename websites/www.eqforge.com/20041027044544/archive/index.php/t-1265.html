<br />
I have been working with this scenario since 1999 and plan to release it as fast as playtesting is complete. <br />
<br />
It is about WW II in Europe. Player can start from 10 different moments of the war (May 1940, July 40, June 41, November 41, July 42, November 42, July 43, June 44, December 44, May 45) and play as leader of Axis, Allies, Soviet Union, France, Vichy France, Spain, Turkey, Finland, Jugoslavia, Sweden or Neutrals. All nations are fully playable and supported by specific events files. Multiplayer version is also created. There are 2 levels of TSfE - medium and hard (.scn, rules and events files are different in both). <br />
<br />
Scenario takes about 25 MB (10 MB are sounds).<br />
<br />
If anybody is interested please choose also which nation you want to playtest. For beginning we playtest big nations in medium level from May 1940 onward. <br />
I have already 2 playtesters for Axis and 1 for Allies and Soviet Union. So I need mostly people for France, Soviet Union and Allies. <br />
<br />
Playtesters need to have Civ2 MGE. They get only neccessary files to play chosed version (about 1,5 MB zipped - I send it in three parts) without sounds. <br />
