They will probably be archers, so if they are archers we should kill the ones not stacked with the leader with our elephant, move our warrior 2 squares W and let the last one attack him on the mountain.<br />
Then, we capture the leader, or if the barb archer won, let him attack the elephant on a mountain, if the elephant has enough HP compared to the archer.<br />
<br />
Or, if the barb leader doens't unload, we just kill everyone with the elephant.</div></div><hr />

do we need to IPRB a phalanx in RF ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Mar 28, 2003, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see how either the Ellie or the warrior could reach RF in less than 4 turns.  That will be too late.<br />
<br />
I would guess the barbs will unload around the little 1 square peninsula SE of RF.  That's all good defensive terrain, so I wouldn't go charging in there right away.  I think our safest bet  is to move the warrior N onto the mountains and and hope he draws attention away from RF.  Move the Elephant E, then NE to the mountain and hope the leader goes with a unit to attack the warrior.  Then the Ellie can ride down the mountain and clean up when it's over.<br />
<br />
Just out of curiosity, was the Ellie supported or None?<br />
<br />
We might also consider moving the settler to the swamp/river one square beyond (SE) the city site so we don't give them a big juicy target to take.  Either that or (gasp!) move him back to RF until the coast is clear, but I wouldn't put down an empty city with red ships offshore.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm pretty sure barb archers have a defense of 1, not 2. so attacking is generally preferable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Mar 28, 2003, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ellie is supported by RF</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Mar 28, 2003, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I think the elephant can reach RF in time to defend it from the barbs:<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads4/democg_2700bc_barbs.jpg<br />
The numbers show the worst-case sequence of events (barbarians heading for RF). The current turn (2700 BC) is not finished so the elephant can immediately start moving towards RF (it should move to spot &quot;1&quot;). Following this the barbs move to spot &quot;2&quot;. Thanks to the river the elephant reaches RF in time. If the trireme unloads at &quot;4&quot; the barbs will be killed by the elephant, possibly assisted by the archer if they unload on two squares. If the trireme instead moves one square and then unloads N/NE of RF the elephant enters RF and has one movement point left to kill, assisted by the archer if barbs get unloaded onto two squares.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Mar 28, 2003, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah...I haven't downloaded, so I didn't realize the Ellie had movement left.  That makes it much easier for the elephant to take the offensive (but attacking makes it less likely that we can capture a leader if there is one.)<br />
<br />
My guess is that the Barbs will unload somewhere around &quot;2.&quot;  Depending on the squares they unload to, it could get tricky because we can't move to &quot;3&quot; if one landed on the Silk, or the two forests on either side of the silk.  That means we can not take as much advantage of the River, and we might be faced with the possibility of attacking at partial strength.  If horses unload we must be particularly careful because they will be able to move off the forests and attack across the river if we get too close.<br />
<br />
It's a shame those barbs had to come now, because I'd like to see the territory to the SW to perhaps find a better site before we commit to the S2 city being the SSC.  That river is promising.  I'm not sure of the exact alignment, but I fear the mountain below the Elephant is the 3 special site, but depending on how that river flows, we might still be able to get a 2 special site that is better than S2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, don't forget that we can try and use settlers as defense also.  They have 2 HP, so they can survive an attack better than a warrior.  The only downside is that they cannot fortify.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Mar 28, 2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Viking, as I see it, the barbs would move to 4 AND UNLOAD IN THE SAME TURN, leaving the elephant to just reach the battlefield (5) in time to either get attacked or watch RF being ransacked.  I hate the delay, but perhaps it would be best to move the settler back into RF for added defense?  No one else can reach it in time to be any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talar</div><div class="date">Mar 28, 2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they unload in the jungle SW of Regia Fanatica the Elephant could still attack. And I think it might be good to have it around anyway since the barbs might land on several squares.<br />
<br />
Will Regia Fanatica have time to grow before the barbs reach it? If not there's a risk they destroy it if they defeat the defender.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In that case the elephant would stop on the banana with one movement point left, thus it would be able to attack. So I think RF should be safe but we are lucky - had the elephant been one square farther away from RF we could have gotten into big trouble.</div></div><hr />

Argg, that ad is the most anoying thing, and its slipping into the Civ2 Demogame :Crasyeye:<br />
<br />
Meanwhile... ...In the Demogame ;)<br />

From what I have read (Cant see the pictures due to upload problems ) Everything looks good. Please dont scare me with the Electrical Storms and Earthquakes ;).</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, RF has no spare food to grow until the settler builds a city. By moving the worker onto the banana instead, we'll lose either the elephant or settler due to lack of support and we won't have shields spare to  build with.</div></div><hr />

I have said it before and I'll say it again: Phalanxes SUCK !! :D (my military advisor elections slogan ?!). Seriously, I don't think we need to build any defensive units for now in RF since the elephant can reach it in time and the elephant and archer together shouldn't have a problem defeating the barbs.<br />
<br />
We are making exactly 1 gold per turn.</div></div><hr />
