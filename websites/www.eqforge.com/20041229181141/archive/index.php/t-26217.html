<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2002, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">uhh...forgive me, I'm not quite getting what you're trying to say.  From what I'm hearing it sounds like either of two things:  either your hard drive is having a full blown failure or you've got some malware.  If your hard drive is new, I wouldn't expect it to be a hard drive failure.  It could be a defective unit, in which case you should exchange it.<br />
<br />
But I think the more likely explanation is a form of malware.  2000 or more files mysteriously appearing in your windows directory sounds like a virus or worm.  If your anti-virus software can't take care of it, you've got an infection that is fast growing out of control in which case I'd say a re-format and re-install is the best way to go.  That'll wipe out the infection and all the mystery files.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TedG</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2002, 04:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You said you have Fix-It Utilities (if I'm not mistaken), and that comes with an anti-virus program. Download the latest update for the anti-virus and scan your whole system to see if it is in fact a virus that is causing your computer to behave strangely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barenziahlover</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2002, 06:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I  just did. You must remember the anti-virse program arenot proactive , they<br />
only come out after than virsue or worm come out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I didn't mean to say that anti-virus programs are perfect, because they're definitely not perfect.:)<br />
<br />
Do you remember doing anything on the computer that you might have gotten a virus from? For example, did you open an email attachment that came from an unknown person? (I ask this because email is the number one way viruses spread)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Barenziahlover</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2002, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I donot open any attrackment from underknow people. I did download some program from many games formus so I donot want to blame anyone. Plus I read somewhere that MS reserve the right to download any program they feel fit without telling you and without you know about it. I did find than unknow program <br />
in the download file which I donot use to download files at all. I delete it after<br />
the touble started and before I use the System image disk. May-be I could have save it to than seperate CD disk so the anti-virsue should have been able to look at it. Sorry I didnot think of <br />
that.</div></div><hr />
