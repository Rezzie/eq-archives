<br />
I'm afraid I'm very busy at the moment at home. And because this is the first time I'm making the results for the GOTM for Civ3 it will be a hell-of-a-job. So I'm afraid the results won't come in the first week of december.<br />
Please be patient. :beer:<br />
<br />
And don't :nuke: me. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pggar</div><div class="date">Nov 28, 2001, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unacceptable!!!<br />
Just kidding. :D <br />
<br />
Is that why I didn't receive any email comfirmation to my submission? And is that why you're not reading your PMs? Or you just have the same &quot;I won't empty my PM box&quot; tendency as Cunobelin Of Hippo. :lol:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lord Oden</div><div class="date">Nov 28, 2001, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">just wondering, how many returns have you recieved?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Nov 29, 2001, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, I have not checked my PM Inbox lately and will do that shortly.<br />
<br />
And I've got about 75 submissions so far!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LeSphinx</div><div class="date">Nov 29, 2001, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">75 submission: that is great !<br />
<br />
Is this the maximum number of player in a GOTM ? <br />
<br />
LeSphinx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Nov 29, 2001, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no maximum.<br />
<br />
There is also a slight problem with the results for this GOTM. Checking the score for each one takes a long time. Much longer than in Civ2. So for the next GOTM one must include his final score and date in his/her e-mail. And I will check only some (the highest scores) to see if the scores given are correct.<br />
<br />
But that will be included in the news post when the next submission is posted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My english is not very good. <br />
<br />
I wanted to known if the number of 75 players in a GOTM was the<br />
big number of players that have played in a GOTM of civ II ? <br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goodyhut</div><div class="date">Nov 29, 2001, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the first GOTM I have submitted, I wanted to wait for civ3 :).  Anyway, take your time Matrix.  You are great to volunteer to do all this.  :goodjob: And I included my score, and year of victory in my email.  I hope mine is one that you have to verify.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am waiting to see the results, in case i need to adjust my play style for game #2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tilemacho</div><div class="date">Dec 06, 2001, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi this is my first post here but I am an old Apolyton user......<br />
<br />
I guess you can go there and check some results of their first civ3 game....to get an idea about how &quot;big&quot; a score can be.....;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Dec 08, 2001, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, yes. It appears Apolyton stole our idea. Such an honour... :D<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've made the ranking, but the results overall are not done yet. I have to make the web pages, find some nice icons for the different type of awards, etc.. Unfortunately (for you), I have a sort of family day tomorrow and I'll probably won't have time to make the results. Expect them done within the next 48 hours. After that, you may start getting angry. ;)<br />
<br />
In any case, I've been working for it for about 6 hours or so and it's now 4:30 AM local time. So I really need a nap now. Bye and sorry but thanks for waiting.<br />
