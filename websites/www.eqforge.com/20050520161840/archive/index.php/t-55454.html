<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stopped Friday's chat prematurely due to a possible conflict between the Military and Domestic departments.  It seems that in order to make the best possible showing in or current war with Egypt, we may have to send our treasury well below what the Domestic Department sees fit.<br />
<br />
-We currently have 146g in our coffers and are making 22 gold per turn.  <br />
<br />
-We have immediate upgrade opportunites for 2 Warriors in Aureus, as well as another coming from Lake Asphinxia in a few turns.  Besides that, we have 8 other warriors , mostly defending our mainland.<br />
<br />
-Domestic had once advised that our treasury limit not dip below 150g.  However, there were no instructions from Domestic for Friday's chat.<br />
<br />
<br />
As I see it right now, there is no reason for us to keep that much gold on hand during this war, and so I would ask that we have no spending limit at this time.<br />
<br />
Here is my reasoning:<br />
<br />
1. I want this war to be a slam dunk. I believe that upgrading these three units(as well as others along the way) can get us very close to that point.<br />
<br />
2. Both Noshuret and Gorina are set to grow within 2 turns.  This will enhance our gpt, especially during our Golden Age.<br />
<br />
3. There is nothing to really use the extra gold for right now except Military.  We don't really need embassies with America or the Aztecs right now, and any possible tech deals for gold are way out of our price range anyway.  Plus, we can't use gold to rush improvements since we are still in Despotism.<br />
<br />
<br />
Believe me, I am not usually a proponent for redlining our treasury but I believe that this situation warrants it.  Let's drive Cleo back to Thebes and beyond with the power of our mighty Legions.  Then, once the dust has settled, we can build a strong commercial base with the help of our newly acquired cities and a properly placed Forbidden Palace.</div></div><hr />

Are we in our golden age? <br />
<br />
Yes, we are, donsig.  We put our military objectives to a vote for a second time and there was still overwhelming support for full-fledged war even with the knowledge that doing so would trigger our Golden Age.  We are currently two turns into our Golden Age.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noldodan</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2003, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea on spending on our money on the only thing that we really can, that being our military.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2003, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We need to use the gold for the military Upgrades and unit upkeep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Plexus</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2003, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, military is the way to spend the money. We need to make a point that we are not to be messed with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cpt Kaos</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2003, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree to spend the money on military. We can build a larger financial base with a larger land base gained at Egypts expense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2003, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since we've chosen to gamble our golden age on this war we'd better go full tilt.  Being still in despotism, which I assume is the case, we cannot use gold to rush improvements.  We could only buy tech and alliances.  I say we forego the latter and eventually use peace negotiations with Egypt for the former.  No use hanging on to the gold right now.  I say spend it all on upgrading our military and then bring the full force of our legions to bear on Egypt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Jun 10, 2003, 08:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The prior instruction was when we were still trading. I do authorize any upgrades. Our legions should be able to force a few techs out of Cleo.<br />
<br />
BTW, I've been really busy beta testing PTW the past week, which is why I've been somewhat inactive. (If the demogame uses PTW for DG4, you'll thank me. ;))</div></div><hr />
