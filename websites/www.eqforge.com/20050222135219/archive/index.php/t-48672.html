I think the red dot is quite a good spot for a SSC.. Eventhough it is located on a Jungle square.. <br />
Irrigating a jungle square to grassland will take about 15 turns, which is a bit long IMO for the 1 food it gains..  And the banana kinda makes up for the 1 loss in food anyways..<br />
So that could be a destination for RF's settler<br />
<br />
LP's warrior should continue exploring since his bad condition doesn't matter for the movement points anyways.. If he runs into a barb then, well, too bad..<br />
<br />
EDIT: As Elsaak and GaryNemo pointed out below, the delta squares are good city sites.. I marked the plains with a white dot, although the jungle square just south east of it is rather optional aswell, since it doesn't overlap with Regia Fanatica at all</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Mar 26, 2003, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the RF settler should found a city immediately and not spend (or waste :D) any time improving land - it can be done later. Ditto for the LP settler when it is finished. There are several promising city sites:<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads4/democg_2950bc.jpg<br />
The &quot;S&quot; sites are possible SSC locations and the &quot;C&quot; sites are possible locations for a city founded by LP's settler.<br />
<br />
S2 and S4 are probably the best sites but S1 has the merit of having access to bananas and S3 is farther away from RF than S4. A fifth possible location would be the 'perfect' (?) spot NW of S4 but improving the terrain there takes too much time IMO so I prefer one of the S sites.<br />
<br />
Big overlap with RF's city radius doesn't worry me at all since the priority will be a big SSC, what we do with RF is of secondary importance.<br />
<br />
C1, C2 and C3 are all isthmus sites for LP's settler. I usually don't like building cities on hills so I prefer C2 to C1 even though C1 has access to LP's fish.<br />
<br />
I have also indicated possible warrior exploration routes. The eastern warrior should not be rested for now since its damage does not slow it down, unlike high-speed units like horses.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">Mar 26, 2003, 08:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like a good plan Viking, although I might like the western warrior to go west a little more.  Maybe that can be doen after your plan is carried out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we do focus on S2 (or any of the S spots), then bridge building should be made more of a priority for the extra tarde it will bring us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Mar 26, 2003, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I’d prefer the unshielded grassland SE of C3 for the canal city.  I guess you could call it “C4”.  I don’t think the defensive advantages of the hill are great enough to have yet another poor trade city, but I’d rather not waste the shielded grassland on the city square.  S2 looks like a good place for the RF settler to go (although a road on one square should be a serious consideration first).  <br />
<br />
A good but frustrating city site exists at 58,38 (3squares NE of the wounded warrior – just into the black), but NONE of its 3 specials are usable at first – one is hidden by grassland and the others are out of sight of land.  But it’s not a site we should forget about.<br />
<br />
RF can produce its settler in 2 turns if we move from the bananas to the shielded grassland to get 4 shields for one turn.  However, this will cost us 1 beaker.   If we stay with the 3-turn settler, don’t forget to move from the Buffalo to Ocean after 2 turns to get the extra arrows since we’ll only need one more shield at that point.<br />
<br />
Also, the healthy Warrior should head towards the hut site just into the black (W-SW) then explore the potential 3 special site to the SW to see if it holds more promise than our river cities for the SSC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Mar 26, 2003, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too was looking at &quot;C4&quot;, but couldn't see leaving a gap between LP and C4.  If we were fine with putting in a filler city in that area (perhaps S of the mountain?), then I think C4 is much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2003, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">S2 and keep the warrior exploring.  S2 start Phx, then HG.<br />
<br />
C1 or C2 would be great hill mine cities, but we can't build one yet.  Maybe as City#6.<br />
<br />
Look again at the Pure Green at the Northern Tip, please. C0.  The LP Settler goes right up and founds, serf on Forest or ocean.<br />
<br />
Then City#5: Silk River Bridge, SE of Silk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2003, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I definitely support S2 as destination for RF settler, no roading on the way.  Tim raises a very interesting point re: the Eastern Isthmus cities.  We will know more once the Warrior explores a bit in that area.  Depending on shape of the continent, we may want to at least leave open the possibility of canal cities in both locations.  The sea immediately East of RF may turn out to be an inland lake.  I also like GN's idea of sending LP's settler north to the grassland to found before sending settlers East.  By then perhaps we can have enough settlers to build a mined hill city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think an eventual filler city beween S2 and C4 (S. of the mountain as DoM described) would be great.  If I'm not mistaken it will have a grassland city square, 1 grassland, 2 plains, 2 forest, 1 hill, 4 ocean squares and 1 mystery square all to itself.  With just 3 irrigations and a mine, that's a nice healthy city putting out 11s/turn (possibly more depending on the black square), even if the surrounding cities are full size.  It doesn't have a lot of food to support long-term settlers, but it makes a nice little production helper for the surrounding cities - churning out camels for centuries.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with a city that won't max out.  <br />
<br />
While I agree with GN that the green square at the top is a good city site, I wouldn't make it our first priority.  I would expand outward, then when it takes too long for core-city settlers to get to the frontiers, fill in the spaces.</div></div><hr />

Switching from Buffalo to Bananas is even better because of the bigger amount of food.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2003, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">An updated map based on the preceding discussion:<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads4/democg_2950bc_2.jpg<br />
There seems to be pretty good agreement about the SSC site so I've removed the &quot;S&quot; sites that were present on the previous map. RF's settler should IMO head to the SSC site ASAP. Maybe we should rush buy RF's settler now ?<br />
<br />
I've added a few additional city sites. C5 seems a very good site based on the preceding discussion. If we build a city there I'd prefer C4 to minimize overlap and a filler city at &quot;FILL&quot;.<br />
<br />
C6 is a very good city site for a settler from RF once we have founded our SSC (which is the #1 priority). C7 is interesting too but improving the terrain there takes a lot of time - I'd prefer C6.<br />
<br />
We should probably build a city at C0 in the future but I prefer C2 to C5 and FILL first because C0 is a much worse site and there will be some time until we see what the foreign coast NE from that site looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2003, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Viking, you are marvelous! :goodjob:  SSC is agreed, then?  <br />
<br />
Leowind and others have stated: &quot;I definitely support S2/SSC as destination for RF settler, no roading on the way. &quot; and I agree.<br />
<br />
I feel we must choose between FILL and C0 for the LP Settler.  Eventually, I like C2 Hill Mine, but we'll need 2 Settlers to found it.  C0 has less corruption, but FILL looks better at creating Settlers - it can borrow the Whale from C2 and even SSC's Fish if SSC doesn't use the Fish any particular turn.  This is generally the benefit of Fillers, btw, good productivity.<br />
<br />
Leowind has noted that LP can found FILL, then C0, then we'd have enough Settlers to found C2 Hill Mine.  I'm not sure C5 is land...  And RF Settler founds SSC, then another Settler to found C6, right?  C7 is far future, when we have Harbors.<br />
<br />
Good points on micromanagement RF: the 2 turn Settler.  Banana, then GLS (where we continue to avoid the Road. Next time, guys?).   But then what?  As RF starts another Sett, and we walk to SSC, the Buffalo may be too much production.  We want to quickly get back up to Size=2, then finish the Settler.  Banana or River Bend Plains?  Or, heretical, Road the GLS!  Naw, the Banana will be good, and I'd rather found SSC and start a Phx ASAP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm for SSC, Fill, C4, and C5.<br />
<br />
Eventually I'd like to get C0 done, but would prefer an outward expansion as we grow, then when the travel time would be too long or the city can't support a settler for very long, get C0 built.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great explanation.  I think building FILL first makes sense as it can use those two specials. I hadn't even thought of that.  But if we're going to build there, I would definitely put the Canal city at C4 so that FILL doesn't get completely squeezed out.  (Not to mention I think its a better site anyway! ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2003, 06:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Statement from the Office of Scientific Research:  The OSR (Office of Scientific Research) formaly endorses the propsed river delta site for a possible SSC (Super Science City).  It is this office's hope that a more promising site may yet be found, but this site has potential to add significantly to our science research in any case.  <br />
There has been controversy as of late regarding the building of roads to some of the outlaying areas immediately South of our capital.  It was the understanding of the OSR that this area was lightly populated and unworked.  There has been some suggestion, however, of utilizing this area from time to time as a means of balancing and maximizing both resource and trade production.  If it is the intention to utilize this area, commonly known as &quot;Shielded Grassland South,&quot; even occasionally, then the OCR recommends building some access roads to facilitate the movement of goods to and from Regia Fanatica, and thus increasing the trade value of the area.  This may delay slightly the founding of the proposed SSC, but will pay off in increased trade during times of its use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talar</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2003, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks really good. C4 seems like the best choice.<br />
<br />
C7 - Is this one really worth it? We are not THAT short on land to settle. Maybe if it had two whale specials.<br />
<br />
SSC site also looks good, but it would be worth moving it one square SE if we could gain a special by doing it.</div></div><hr />
