<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfi Wolfe</div><div class="date">Jan 01, 2002, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to use the patch and I've started right now.<br />
<br />
(better than last month when I had to wait till after I got back to the states from annual training for national guard, dec20)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WOPR</div><div class="date">Jan 01, 2002, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I try to load the GOTM save game, I get presented with numerous bizarre pop-up errors...which involve words like CULT and ESPN.  Really strange.<br />
<br />
Anyone else having this problem? :eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WOPR</div><div class="date">Jan 01, 2002, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Never mind.  :)   If you try to run the GOTM without the patch, you can expect those error messages.  :nuke:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Jan 01, 2002, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess that answers whether it is patch only or not, thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rangers85</div><div class="date">Jan 01, 2002, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thunderfall, do you think it could be possible to upload an original post-patch bic file.  I heavily editted mine to change some stuff, however, forgot to backup my original bic and don't really want to re-download that whole patch.  I'm sure there's others out there with the same problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Jan 02, 2002, 12:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just installed Civ3 on my new computer, here is the .bic file with patch applied. (zipped)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rangers85</div><div class="date">Jan 02, 2002, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks greatly Aeson</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Genuis</div><div class="date">Jan 02, 2002, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thunderfall what terrain mod are you using in this screenshot?  The graphics look a lot better than the original.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">luis cid</div><div class="date">Jan 02, 2002, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:cry: i can't play the gotm with the yellow path.Can you make a saved game without it?ty:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Captain Pugwash</div><div class="date">Jan 03, 2002, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it would be a good idea when announcing a new gotm to include the version number you need to be able to play it. As it is, the information given is incomplete. I loaded gotm3 and it didnt work.<br />
<br />
Civ3 has only been released for a couple of months and already we have incompatible versions.<br />
<br />
Maybe you guys who are obsessed with patches should stand back and look at the big picture. Many of us out here have bought a shrink wrapped game which works fine..why would we want to patch it ? How do we know the patch doesnt just introduce problems we didnt have ?<br />
<br />
Anyways, looks like I wont be playing gotm. Shame cos its a good idea lost through incompatibility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pagh80</div><div class="date">Jan 03, 2002, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can find the modpack here:  http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?threadid=8969<br />
<br />
And i must agree. It is a lot nicer too look at... and play with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">barefootbadass</div><div class="date">Jan 03, 2002, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pugwash - It is important to have people playing the same version(at least if they are sending in their save games), many bugs were fixed in the patch that address balance in the game, as well as some stats of units being changed.<br />
<br />
I would suggest downloading the updates, your license entitles you to do that and when the saves are incompatible with previous versions you will maintain that compatibility.  Later the patches might be compatible with previous versions when they become less significant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Genuis</div><div class="date">Jan 04, 2002, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks!  I am downloading it now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lt. 'Killer' M.</div><div class="date">Jan 06, 2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HELP! I stil have trouble downloading from this forum (and only here). Netscape insists the GOTM is &quot;attachment.php&quot;! Same goes for the above posted original bic!<br />
<br />
Could someone tell me what I`m doing wrong? Or just post them both again?<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FriendlyFire</div><div class="date">Jan 07, 2002, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah need patch<br />
