<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2002, 04:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have several recurring reminders in Outlook set to go off at certain times to remind me to do stuff or to watch for errors (on the AIX box at work that make sure the databases Tivoli is checking are up). Well they work except for the fact that they show up generally 5 minutes to early. Sometimes they even show up late. Either way it is a pain because I need them to show up right at the time because I can be distracted sometimes and forget within 5 minutes if the errors did actually go off. So what I am asking is if there is a way to get Outlook to check on the scheduled time instead of a few minutes before or after. Danka!</div></div><hr />

You can set it for &quot;0&quot; minutes in advance if you want. :)</div></div><hr />

It is very annoying to be told I have a meeting 5 minutes after the meeting was suppose to start even though I have the reminder set to tell me 15 minutes before. Which makes it 20 minutes late! The only thing that they came up with is to run the following: &quot;outlook /cleanreminders&quot; from the run dialog. It spends some time supposedly fixing it up. It only seems to work for a limited amount of time. I have thought about putting the &quot;/cleanreminders&quot; option right in the shortcut that I use to bring it up every day, but have not tried it yet.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the tip. I just had a reminder that an alarm was going to go off in 0 minutes. :D Don't ask!</div></div><hr />
