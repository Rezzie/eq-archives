<br />
*	Each player shall have 2 characters that cannot die. They can die at player's discretion<br />
*	Each player's character(s) belongings will go to those 2 new characters<br />
*	Each player will need to choose which 2 characters they chall keep alive. The others will disappear.<br />
*	Characters can die from events and conflicts, but not old age.<br />
<br />
<br />
Techs we have:<br />
to be updated.<br />
<br />
Rule with technology: We may do anything that we have the technology for OR are researching OR are one tech away from.<br />
IE- We may now begin banking (OCT!!) since we are researching currency.<br />
<br />
Special Rules: <br />
Special Rule One: The Jedi. The Jedi are similar to a religion and are allowed at Polytheism. They are able to use The Force, since it is a spirtual thing. Lightsabers are NOT allowed until Electricity. Until then, use colored weapons.<br />
<br />
More special rules are to be added as we go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">stuck, before i continue play some questions:<br />
<br />
1) where do we register our &quot;new&quot; characters? and where are the rules for the stats of them?<br />
2) if we &quot;takeover&quot; old characters, are we allowed to just use their names, ownings and status and setup new stats for them?<br />
3) when will land corruption be implemented?<br />
4) when will the &quot;absent thread&quot; be implemented?<br />
5) if we setup 2 characters, will the second be inheriting the 1sts owings and vici versa if one dies due to an event or something?<br />
6) will it be possible that both characters die at the same time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can answer 5 and 6.<br />
<br />
5) the ownings will be given to the 2nd char if one dies, and vici versa<br />
<br />
6) yes it will be possible for both to die.<br />
<br />
3) I'm a little edgy on, but I may use your plan, but a little revised :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2003, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) registry will come soon<br />
2) no, we can take the entire character. if you want to do new stats, go on ahead.<br />
4) see registry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2003, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">more questions:<br />
1) i think the commanding units forumla is not right, as it gives us controll of far too many units, and thus leads to positions being obsolete as nobody would need commanders for their army... example: if i choose W=16, C+I=16, then i could controll at least 256 units, which is crazy. even more in future ages... also, i think charisma should be the most influencial factor, not work-efficiency... the formula should be something like (C)*(W+I)/10 or maybe even (C)(C)(W)(I)/500, which would lead to a max of 32 units ;-) which could then be multiplied with the age-factor...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2003, 03:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2) each character is treated as idividual, right? so we also need economical calculations for EACH character, right? as such, if one of those married characters has accountancy&gt;6 this would not count as a gold+1 for the other character, right? even if the player states that that character does &quot;all money things for those 2&quot;...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EVEN BETTER PROPOSAL FOR THE UNIT CONTROLL:<br />
this would be (C+I)^3 * W * A<br />
and a divisior at your choice, i would propose 3000 or 2000<br />
<br />
<br />
or even better imho:<br />
<br />
C^3 * I^2 * W * A<br />
<br />
and my proposed divisor is 30000 here</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2003, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">that is the formula we will be using. and as for one, yes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2003, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dis made a proposal about the use of Chartered Accountancy and its effect on the entire income, where<br />
0.82+TAN(Accountancy/32)<br />
This would serve as a multiplier for the entire income, not just +1<br />

Thoughs?</div></div><hr />
