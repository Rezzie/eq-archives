<br />
Things to consider:<br />
How to deal with the barbs?<br />
<br />
Is my way of finishing of the French all right. Grenoble won't be a problem. Paris shouldn't be a problem either for 5 vet cavs, despite the walls.<br />
<br />
Anyone want to name the hill city in Jayneland? Maybe not a barb-name.<br />
<br />
Next turn is an oedo-year. Can we manage the french next turn as a democracy. As long as we don't have any contact with the French after capturing Grenoble, can't we use Andu Indorin's senate trick? All the cities are at least ready for celebrations.<br />
<br />
Is the spending satisfactory? I've bought everything I can whenever a city has had 1+ shields.<br />
<br />
Without an engineer in Eretria that road was hard to start with. The food surplus in Hell isn't great either, so they can't support many more engineers.<br />
<br />
The chinese are also getting on my nerves. I want them away from our rail. They probably will declare war if we ask them to leave, but I didn't want to do that without consulting the advisors.<br />
<br />
Africa-Woodland Rail is complete, transfering troops to india is now a piece of cake.<br />
<br />
We have 8 vans for trade delivery in RF, and 8 vans for work delivery in Neu. But now that most cities have finished their improvements, the amount of vans being produced is increasing.<br />
<br />
I'm working this week, so I won't be here as much as I've been the past weeks, and I won't play until next weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Aug 18, 2003, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things are looking great and the MoDA is happy to see that Tlaxcala and Lahore now belong to us :).<br />
<br />
Since we have the Statue of Liberty oedo years do not matter. I think we should revolt now (or possibly next turn if troops outside cities are a problem). Following this we can start celebrating.<br />
<br />
A fortified cavalry in Berlin will probably survive an elephant attack since the city is on a river but it would be a good idea to rush buy alpine troops there now just in case. Also the diplomat should enter the city to be ready to bribe barbs.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind a war against the Chinese (mostly defensive at first), there is a ship to sink near VM plus the caravans. Another idea would be to simply bribe all of the Chinese caravans (doing nothing is not an option IMO, we must either bribe or kill the caravans).<br />
<br />
I'd like to see one of the Hell engineers dedicated to constructing the Hell-Barbaria road even though there are not many engineers there. We'd add more engineers later (and all Hell cities that can build harbors should do so ASAP if they do not already have a harbor).<br />
<br />
I'll soon take a more detailed look at the game (I just returned from vacation) but at a quick glance it seems the existing plans for the cities are still more or less valid. Caravans should be stockpiled in Coresux and some of the cities there may need to rush buy colosseums once we have celebrated for a few turns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Aug 18, 2003, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome back Viking.:) <br />
<br />
Bribing the caravans is a good alternative unless they cost too much. Anyone know how much they'd cost? Or should we have a limit? Otherwise they probably will declare war if we ask them to leave.<br />
<br />
I also forgot about us having the statue. I usually skip it, so I never think about it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Aug 18, 2003, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We should have a limit somewhere in the $300-600 range. If the caravans are cheap we should bribe them regardless of whether we start a war against the Chinese or not.<br />
<br />
I forgot to mention that it would be really nice to have more than one big city in Barbaria. So unless Berlin soon grows to size 3 (I haven't checked that) maybe we should add an engineer to it to immediately get Berlin to size 3 so it can be celebrated to size 10-12 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Aug 18, 2003, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Berlin is 5f away from size 3, and it has a surplus of 2-3f, which means we can get it to size 3 in three 3 turns. If we want to celebrate it, a caravan would also be nice so that we can get it a route to india.<br />
<br />
From where should we take the engineer from that is to build the great road between Hell and Barbaria? Either from west or from south?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Aug 18, 2003, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One (or preferably two) of the engineers near Corinth can start constructing the Hell-Barbaria road. Cities like Corinth, Sparta and Argos could build additional engineers, they can easily support more than one engineer. These engineers should be rush built ASAP (finish any caravans and improvements first).<br />
<br />
Yes, I now see that Berlin will soon grow - it's possible to speed this growth by working the river grassland square. I think we should add the engineer east of BBF to Barbieville to get that city to size 3, it can become a very big and powerful city. Loot can build a galleon instead of Barbieville.<br />
<br />
How about naming the hill city in Jayneland &quot;Viking's Holiday Resort&quot; ? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Aug 19, 2003, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not that &quot;Viking's Holiday Resort&quot; is a bad name, but it's too long, &quot;Viking's Resort&quot; would work better.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Aug 24, 2003, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When will the next set of turns be played ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Aug 24, 2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I start school tomorrow, and I might be free on wednesday to play, otherwise next weekend. We need to discuss how to do with celebrations, for how long, when to start and what to do with the french.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Aug 24, 2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm... I thought everything having to do with democracy and celebrations had already been decided (see this poll (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?threadid=60734)) - maybe everyone was waiting for someone else to do something :D. The only question is for how long we celebrate but this does not need to be discussed until 5-10 turns from now when it starts becoming difficult to sustain the celebrations.<br />
<br />
We should revolt now (or next turn if troops outside cities are a possible problem).<br />
<br />
We can take both of the known French cities next turn (before democracy). We then need to find the only remaining city and capture unless the senate interferes.<br />
<br />
In contrast to the above, after the next set of turns has been played we'll need to take a lot more detailed look at what to do, including science (!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Aug 26, 2003, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had missed that last city.:eek: <br />
<br />
I'll play this weekend. And I'll get the two known cities next turn, then revolt. The last french city I'll go on a hunt for, trying to avoid the senate.</div></div><hr />
