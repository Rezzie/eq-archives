<br />
These build queues reflect the fact that we will soon start celebrating, thus many cities will reach size 12, making sewers necessary. At the same time, improvements like banks and courthouses are necessary to keep the celebrations going.<br />
<br />
In addition to sewers, banks and courthouses, these build queues also see the start of military buildup for sending some peacekeeping troops to Hell (informal name for the province containing cities occupied by the evil Greeks :D). EF, Naer and FW will begin this by building barracks and crusaders. So this also reflects division of labor with cities in western Coresux and in the far east concentrating on happiness and caravans but cities in mid-Coresux having more military oriented build queues.<br />
<br />
We also need more engineers, not only for founding a city on Coresux' northern tip but also to improve the land faster and start changing jungle squares to grassland. Refrigeration and railroad are not far in the future (also the reason a supermarket appears in Dou's build queue).<br />
<br />
&quot;RB&quot; means that the item in question should be finished as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Option 14 is there because we may not have cash and time for growing every city beyond size 12. In that case I recommend concentrating on making cities like Neu, LC, RF and PB grow. VM is also included since it has access to four specials and can become a great city.<br />
<br />
Always vote for 0. It makes it possible to see if a particular build queue has majority support. For example, if 0 gets 5 votes and build queue 12 (Ipec) only 2 it means the build queue does not have majority support and should be changed. If you do not vote for something please indicate how the build queue in question should be changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does Bach(caravans) mean that we're only supposed to use caravans and no money?</div></div><hr />

Regarding Bach, I see the poll question is misleading, this should really be &quot;Bach (using caravans [in Neu]+cash)&quot;, i.e. use caravans and cash. In the poll I was trying to say &quot;use the caravans in Neu for the wonder&quot; without precluding using $$ too but this isn't exactly obvious :blush:.</div></div><hr />
