Things in parenthesis are what we get with that tech, things in brackets are what would be required to get that tech.  Please vote for two or three, and we'll create a preference list so we have backups in case what we want is unavailable.</div></div><hr />

Happy, Smart, and growing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 07:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No question - monotheism is by far the most important goal, followed by astronomy and republic.<br />
<br />
Monotheism also implies polytheism (which is a prereq tech) and which is nice to get in the near future to be able to build elephants if we need to kill something.<br />
<br />
We want a better government, therefore republic (WLTP in the SSC !). And astronomy to build Copernicus in our SSC.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to acquire bridge building (for roads on the rivers near the SSC), construction (aqueduct in the SSC once we are a republic) and later on, medicine to build Shakespeare in the SSC to keep everyone happy. We have too little knowledge of geography to know the importance of getting navigation (but astronomy is a prereq there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blissful_Zen</div><div class="date">May 07, 2003, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monothiesm, Astronomy......would be our long term goals.  We should be able to pick something that is leading to one of them, almost everytime.   Polythiesm, i beleive we will get from one of the civs we contact once we build MPE.  We should be able get all of what we need to bring us to researching astronomy, by the turn after  the completion of MPE.  <br />
<br />
Maybe we should research something we know the AI civ is going to have.  So that after the mass trading on MPE turn.  We can switch our tech to something more useful, hopefully astronomy.  To do this we have to get the tech we are reasearcing from one of the AI's.   Do people think this can be done?   <br />
<br />
I think we should turn science back to how it was.  However i see the point of keeping taxes up for a bit more.  Maybe we should comprimise, and turn science up 10% every turn or 2, until its back to 70%.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 07, 2003, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I admit I haven't looked very deeply into this but isn't it likely that we could actually get astronomy (followed by navigation) sooner if we get republic first because of its superior science rate compared to monarchy, even though this means researching a few more techs ?<br />
<br />
Also let's not forget that the moment we switch to republic we can start growing our happy (it has the HG) SSC up to size 8 and possibly 12 without lots of luxuries.<br />
<br />
I agree that we need Mike before republic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RegentMan</div><div class="date">May 08, 2003, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to see: Seafaring, University, the Republic, or Bridge Building.<br />
<br />
Seafaring- We can build harbors in our newly-founded coastal cities to help them grow quicker.<br />
<br />
University- Do we have a shot at Adam Smith's Trading Co.? If we do, lets get started on being able to build it in the near future.<br />
<br />
the Republic- An excellent form of government for an excellent nation.<br />
<br />
Bridge Building- I hate not being able to build roads on a square just because of a river! Dam river :p !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">May 08, 2003, 09:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">RegentMan, welcome to the game :wave:  I, too, really like Adam Smith's, but it is a ways off yet and Copernicus and Michelangelo's Chapel are more important in the meantime, which is why they are currently leading in this poll.  Appreciate your input, and hope you'll stay with us :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RegentMan</div><div class="date">May 08, 2003, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, Copernicus would be best for its science boost to our Super Science City. Which city were we thinking of being the SSC? And free cathedreals are more important than saving a few gold right now (plus we don't want the AI to get it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 09, 2003, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome to the game.<br />
<br />
Doughnutia is our SSC with HG and Colossus already completed. The plan is to build improvements like marketplace, courthouse, library and aqueduct there ASAP as well as Copernicus.<br />
<br />
Longer term goals are Shakespeare and Isaac Newton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">May 09, 2003, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please view and vote in the 100BC Science run-off poll.  Only three people have voted there as of this posting.</div></div><hr />
