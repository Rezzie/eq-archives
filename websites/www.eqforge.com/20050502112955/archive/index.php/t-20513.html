Are you planning to use the new patch in the next GOTM?  I just want to know early enough so I can play a game or two on my own before the next GOTM just to get used to the new features.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is assuming that the patch is released by then.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Can we use the patch on this month's (April's) GOTM or should we stay with v1.17?  I need to know if I should finish the current GOTM before installing the new patch.:confused:</div></div><hr />

Read further. I changed my mind. :o<br />
<br />
Same as with every patch: you may use it for the current GOTM, but you must use it for the next ones. :)</div></div><hr />

Just want to re-raise this now that the patch is in the open, and people have started to see the effects.  I understand that it has reduced corruption, so there appears to be a lot of incentive to install it for the GOTM - those using it could do 'better' than those not.<br />
<br />
I would vote for not using it until the next GOTM (I'm about 3/4 of the way through the current one).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 21, 2002, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem is that we then deny people playing the GOTM installing the new patch.<br />
<br />
But I think you're right nevertheless. Last patches made it commonly harder, so installing the patch back then only gave you a disadvantage. But since that is not the case now, so:<br />

Patch disallowed.<br />

One person asked me in chat last night. I said it was ok to start with 1.21 and referred him to this thread - at that time it said here that it was ok...<br />
<br />
I don't think the differences between 1.17 and 1.21 will make a large difference. The change to corruption isn't huge. The AIs seem (in limited testing so far) to play a little better, which could offset that a bit. (Not much at Warlord level I guess.)</div></div><hr />
