&quot;...and reloading the game when things don't go the way you wanted are all considered cheating.&quot;<br />
<br />
So for my opinion restarting is also cheating. (Because you reload the Game 4000BC).<br />
<br />
Am I right?<br />
<br />
I am asking because I´ve seen in differnt postings that players seem to reload. :(<br />
<br />
Or do they reload and don´t submit.<br />
<br />
Matrix, what do you say ?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tetley</div><div class="date">Dec 04, 2001, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think restarting at 4000 bc is cheating.  That's just playing the game again.  Actually, it can be more FUN the second go-around!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunderfall</div><div class="date">Dec 04, 2001, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Restarting the game from the beginning is definitely consider cheating because you have seen the map and know the location of resources. The rules page states that &quot;...replaying of the game are not allowed&quot;, so there is no confusion on this. <br />
<br />
You are welcomed to replay the game as many times as you want, as long as you submit those saved games from your first try. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AgentRev</div><div class="date">Dec 04, 2001, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had to start over several times.  The bloody Romans or Barbarians just keep pilling on me and there is no way to win, therefore forcing a restart.  Played 5 times so far using different tactics each time, but never having my poor Greek civilization surviving even to 1000AD.<br />
<br />
Once I thought I was doing well, paying my taxes to Rome (Caesar demands X Gold), keeping a lock on the Iron and 2 of the Horses (Rome starts right next to the third BTW), but Caesar suddenly declared war for no reason...with 5 turns half my cities were either burned to the ground (yes burned Caesar decided he didn't want them), or betrayed me and went to Rome control.  The other half under heavy seige, and Caesar won't even talk to my ambassadors so I can't even attempt to sue for peace.<br />
<br />
I tried with just 3 cities and set my production to get off this forsaken island as fast as possible.  4 turns before the Great Lighthouse and Athens is beseiged by 3 stacks of 24 Barbarian horseman.  72 Horse against my 4 Hoplite.  Needless to say it was an overrun even with 3 of those Hoplite being elite.  Production destroyed and the villiagers killed in the streets.  Suddenly Athens has 1 pop, 150 turns till Lighthouse, and my treasury is empty.  Next turn Rome declares war on me...this time without even an initial Hello, give us all your crap.  Just rolled right in and captured Sparta and Thermopylae.<br />
<br />
I definitly don't understand how in the hell anyone has managed to win this GOTM without a few restarts.  And with a decent score either.<br />
<br />
So when all hope is lost restarting is the only option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AgentRev</div><div class="date">Dec 04, 2001, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh yea, and by the way I'm not even gonna submit my games, there is no possible way I could even place let alone get first.  Principle of the matter though I must go back to the game and fight off the Romans at the gate of Athens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">basta72</div><div class="date">Dec 04, 2001, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just won the game without reloading. It can be done with just a little skill and some luck. You just have to be carefull in the beginning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Dec 04, 2001, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Point is we're all in the same boat, AgentRev. If you can't win and retire with a low score, you're probably not the only one. We're in this together now. (Nine Inch Nails)<br />
<br />
And if restarting is allowed, then the amount of time you're willing to spend on the GOTM will be rewarded, and I don't want that.<br />
<br />
Edit: This was my 1000th post!! I didn't see it because the post count is gone, but here it is!!! :D [dance]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirty Clint</div><div class="date">Dec 04, 2001, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no need to reload. Instead of reloading the game spend time reading all the great strategy threads here and at Apolyton.<br />
I was struggling when I first bought the game to even win at Regent level and I could beat Civ2 at Deity 80% - 90% of the time.<br />
But now after reading all the great strategy's (and there are some beautys) and sitting down and devising my own, I have never lost at Monarch level and lower. You will never get any better by reloading and whats the fun in seeing the same map all the time, it just gets frustrating. Slow down, take notes if you need to, set goals, and enjoy the game. There are no tournament prizes and fun is the number one goal, right? <br />
<br />
My top tip - Go here, http://www.apolyton.net/civ3/ , and read the strategy section, especially any thread by Velociryx, adapt his ideas to your playing style, and I assure you that you will improve out of site.<br />
 <br />
:)  ENJOY THE GAME, YOU WILL IMPROVE. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Dec 05, 2001, 12:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing I like most about the GOTM is no reload honor code.  I never mastered Civ II like some who post here and rarely played a game without going back to an earlier save.  Now I take my lumps no matter what.  I don't even reload an earlier save if I accidentally press the wrong key.<br />
<br />
I've found it's more fun to just plow ahead.  I also learned that in many situations I would have given up on previously I actually came through all right.  No restarting forces to you learn your lessons.<br />
<br />
The current Civ III GOTM is my second game on monarch level, and I may suffer the same fate (being killed by hordes of horsemen).  It's starting to sink in that one major difference between Civ II and Civ III is that in the latter the different civs must be played using different strategies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LeSphinx</div><div class="date">Dec 05, 2001, 04:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you donsig, Matrix...<br />
<br />
Reload is the easy way. In the first games you play, you make mistakes and this mistakes will help you to improve for your future games. It's not fair to reload game. We play all of us because we like civ games and it's a good way to exchange things (strategy , see how others like to play, tips...).  T<br />
he &quot;No Reload Honor Code&quot; as to be respected!<br />
<br />
Thinks are not going very good for me in the GOTM 2. I have not reload my position . Yesterday, going to bed, I thought I was going to stop the GOTM 2 because I'm in a bad situation I not used to. But, this morning, waking up, I said NO! I will fight in order to see how I can do and I hope I will learn things. And I will play GOTM 2 because of all the others who plays and have manage their game best than mine. <br />
<br />
This time (GOTM 2), I learn 2 thinks:<br />
- Go to war with your neigboord during ancient time (I do not like war but if your make it quick with big strategy you can improve your civilization: great leader, solid offensive and defensive army...) This will help you to establish your civ for trading purpose...<br />
So now, I will go to war in order to have at minimum 2 great leaders: 1 to build an army and 1 to rush a wonder (Specialy the forbiden palace) - (It took this strategy for GOTM 1 and this work good)<br />
- Reads all the strategies tips in the forum and adapt it at my way of playing.<br />
<br />
So, Yes to the &quot;no reload honor code&quot; because we respect each others.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tetley</div><div class="date">Dec 07, 2001, 05:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey man,<br />
<br />
I saw your post about counting GOTM #2's with and without the patch (preferably with).  I think because of the lowered corruption, those who already started without the patch will be at a noticable disadvantage.<br />
<br />
So can we restart with the patch?   :p    tee hee....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sultan Bhargash</div><div class="date">Dec 14, 2001, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. I dont think the lowered corruption will make as much of a difference as the &quot;smooth sailing&quot; lighthouse, regenerating trees, and 32 turn Iron Working of Pre-patch days, but I would like it if we get to see whether the winning posts are patch or not.<br />
<br />
2. There are two approaches to re-loading in a scenario like this one.  Admit that you re-start from the begining once the Romans are kicking your ass but you know where the iron is, or pretend that your second or third city just happened to be over the iron and righteously condemn re-starters.  In this scenario, it will not be hard to notice those early Iron area cities popping up, where the tendency of a non-cheat game would be to grow slowly down the coast past the elephants and be f***'d when the Romans grab the iron.  <br />
<br />
3.  That being said, I have to restart the game.  I didnt save it when I got my ass kicked the first time, and I didnt save it when I made a cheating run with a settler for the iron the second time.  And I didnt keep restarting at the huts over and over.  So I am going to play it now &quot;as if I didnt know&quot; where the iron or huts was, &quot;as if I didnt know&quot; that the Romans will chew me a new one if I leave cities undefended in their path, and &quot;as if I didnt know&quot; that being honest on this post might make it hard for me to expect my results to be posted.  But then, I am confident that I wont be &quot;winning&quot; this one in any way and I promise not to do it again next month...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sultan Bhargash</div><div class="date">Dec 14, 2001, 03:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, now I give up.  A couple hours of trying it the way I said I would in that last post.  I was researching towards Literature, built up Collosus, changed to Library.  Two turns before I could finish the Library, someone else builds it.  I trade Literature to Rome for Masonry, switch to Pyramids.  Next turn the Aztecs build pyramids.  So Im stuck with Colossus and 199 extra shields.  Rome puts a spearmen outside of all of my cities.  I give in to demands.  I corner a horse when I find it and build walls around it, while researching hoseback riding.  Rome is now standing on my roads.  I ask him to move.  He declares war, cuts off my roads.  Soon after he takes the city with walls and a veteran spearman and a horseman with a regular warrior and a horseman.  I get the endless archers going.  The world passes us by, Caesar is up 5 techs on me, the war will only end if I pay for it to end, even my ivory roads are cut off.  THIS GOTM SUCKS!!!  Super Geniuses who could win Civ 2 on Deity level without somehow cheating might enjoy it, but I am with you, AgentRev, there aint no cure for the &quot;Your starting resource is jungle, you are 90% as fast as AI at tech, now give Caesar the damn city&quot; blues.  I will tell you this, if this game had cheat mode, I would have wiped the f****er out with stealth bombers quick fast in a hurry and shoved a ***** up his *****'s ***.  As it is, I wont be submitting my GOTM, just watching you geniuses figure it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess i should use my brains, I found romans early, i should know they ned iron, and therefore i should have sent men out exploring the whole map to find any, I just didn't think i guess.<br />
<br />
No reload though, I suck, no use trying to hide it.:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smirk</div><div class="date">Dec 14, 2001, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not that bad Sultan. Of course its difficult its monarch difficulty. The main point is that it starts as an uphill battle, you have lousy land, and your neighbor has great land. Thats just your first trial, and the rest should not be said here since not everyone knows where the other Civs are. Please keep so-called spoiler info only in the spoiler thread. Matrix<br />
<br />
I finally got my iron road together around 100-200AD, and that will seal the fate of the romans. And yes they were all over my land and roads etc, but I have hoplites out the ass. I have a string of hoplites standing on the important sections of my road. And on both the iron and horses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eliezar</div><div class="date">Dec 14, 2001, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iron is being made out to be too important in this game.  The first unit I produced that needs iron was the knight and by the time I was building knights the Romans were dying left and right to horsemen.  I'll take horsemen over swordmen anyday.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirty Clint</div><div class="date">Dec 14, 2001, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yup, same here bud. Heaps of despot rushed horseman took care of the romans before iron was an issue. The first city I took was their iron one, hehe, but I never needed it to wipe them out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Not</div><div class="date">Dec 15, 2001, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:D It's about 100BC and the romans have 1.5x the cities that i do. I havn't restarted the game yet, but the barbarians that showed up in like 300BC made me so mad!!! grrr....<br />
2 huge stacks of horsemen ransak my newest city draining my treasery down from 1200 gold to 43 gold. then they appear again at my northern capital cities i had 1 elite hoplite in a mountain and sent it after the huge stack of 14-18 fortified it, and i hoped for the best. 1 after another 0 damage, 0 damage, 0 damage, 2 damage, 1 damage, dead. Well in My only city with a wonder next to the invation I almolst wet my pants.:confused: :eek: :p but in athens 3 tiles away i had 2 archers and a hepolite. I sent the two archers out and managed to knock out 5 more. But i got lucky and my hopilite reinforcements managed to destroy the attacking horse men.<br />
So that is wear i am lacking in techs, no war with the romans yet. My stratagey so far was only builf hopilites. I have yet to make contact with anyother civ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sultan Bhargash</div><div class="date">Dec 17, 2001, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys are tougher than me.  I tried an eight time to get past the Romans but short of making a beeline for the horses and iron, which is what you all did, right?, there is no way to adopt any strategy other than huddling hoplites.  I surrender.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eliezar</div><div class="date">Dec 17, 2001, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just checker expanded south at the beginning of the game and when I met the romans and traded for the wheel I had horses close to one of my cities.  That was pretty easy.<br />
<br />
I didn't really get iron until I conquered the Roman city that was near it.<br />
<br />
Eliezar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pvondrak</div><div class="date">Dec 17, 2001, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You don't necessarily even need horses or iron.  In my game, I got warrior code from him, expanded sw to the plains area with 4 cattle, and made a road down to Veii.  Then I attacked with 3 archers and 3 hoplites, and took Veii and Rome, then got two more cities when I asked for peace.<br />
<br />
Get your first city up to a decent size before building settlers, and otherwise just pump out earlier military and go for the heart of his fledgling empire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tetley</div><div class="date">Dec 17, 2001, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I beelined for the high-food areas.  That the Iron was fairly close to a Flood Plain was pure luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smirk</div><div class="date">Dec 17, 2001, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah my story is the same as tetley, I got the flood plains. Of course once the map was uncovered and I got iron working, I made a beeline, but up until that point that area of the map was largely worthless, better areas to settle elsewhere.</div></div><hr />
