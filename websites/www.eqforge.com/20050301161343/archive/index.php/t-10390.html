I had a luxury coming into the city so I had a happy person. When I rushed the project I lost a citizen, as warned, but no more happy person. Is this forever or would I have gotten another in time?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">J Fred Muggs</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, but still confused. I had a luxury coming into the city, rushed the project, happy person was taken away, no more happy people even though a luxury was still coming to the city. Don't understand why the luxury wasn't doing it's happy thing any more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xunziir</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe its a temporary reaction (10 turns I think) to rushing the project. I think for each person lost in this way someone else in the city (or perhaps everyone?) becomes less happy for 10 turns.<br />
<br />
Don't do anything &quot;mean&quot; for 10 turns and then go back and check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jc011</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did anything happen after that could have caused unhappiness in cities?? Maybe a entertainer got taken away?? I'm stumped too. :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pggar</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's right when you rush something your people get mad at you. I don't know for how long, but it depends on how many times you did it. In the GOTM, I rushed so many things in the aztec capital that it took me more than 30 turns to get the peolple happy again.<br />
I dunno if you guys know that, but when you have an unhappy person in your city, if you click on him/her a box pop up telling why the people is unhappy. Look at the picture, I had 4 happy faces from luxuries and not a single happy citizen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">J Fred Muggs</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope nothing happened. It was just one of many many starts I've done. Hadn't tried that feature of rushing since I first got the game and didn't have a luxury the first time I tried it. Don't even think I was in contact with another civ, population hadn't gone up, nothing really happened except the build rush,<br />
<br />
I have a saved game that fits the bill for trying it again. This time I'll count the turns and see when/if the happy person comes back.<br />
<br />
Does the same thing happen when you draft someone? I know it made me unhappy for 2 years :crazyeyes</div></div><hr />

I didn't get an unhappy person just the normal/inbetween face.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, you don't get unhappy people because your luxuries make them content. As I pissed the aztecs off so much, they started becoming unhappy and the luxuries didn't help. I had to starve them and put some entertainers in the city</div></div><hr />

Its under the rules in the Civ3mod.bic under the General Setting tab.  I believe it cause 20 turns of unhappiness for each rush job and each draft units (I am in my 4th game and has yet to use that two features).  Of course if you have trade come in to the city you might not have unhappy faces but I can assure you that the happy guy is gone:D</div></div><hr />

Why can't I post a picture? There's something wrong because the forum is too slow. I hope the server is not about to crash. That's the same kind of problem I had last time it crashed.</div></div><hr />
