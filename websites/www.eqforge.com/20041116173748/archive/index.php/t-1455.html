I want to make the ultimate Civ2 medieval patch. The basis for the game is a GIGANTIC map of Europe with sailable rivers, and great growth potential. There shouldn't be too many cities to begin with, but the terrain and techs should allow for grand exploring and interesting development of the lands. I have many ideas myself, but I would like to hear your ideas. <br />
Which tribes should be included and why? What kind of techs? Which will be the main cities?<br />
<br />
The main focus will be the overall development of Europe from the baptism of Clovis and Charlemagne in the early middle ages to the disovery of the New World in 1492.<br />
<br />
The patch will probably come with a scenario file, and I'd like to include major events.<br />
<br />
An incomplete list so far :<br />
<br />
* The Baptism of Clovis (scenario start)<br />
* Invasion of the Huns and Magyars<br />
* The Viking Raids &amp; Danelagen<br />
* The Growth of Monasteries<br />
* Rise of Feudalism<br />
* Norman Invasion of England<br />
* The Investiture Controversy<br />
* The First Crusade and recapture of Jerusalem<br />
* The Later Crusades against arabs in Spain, heretics in southern France, and the sacking of Constantinople of the Fourth Crusade.<br />
* Mongol invasions<br />
* The Great Schism<br />
* The Black Death<br />
* The 100 Years War<br />
* Marco Polos travels<br />
* Introduction of Advanced Siege Techniques and Gunpowder<br />
* Great trade ports of Venice and North Italy<br />
* Voyage of Columbus (scenario ends)<br />
<br />
-The difficult part will be deciding which tribes should be in it, and how to simulate the rise of different nations as time goes by.<br />
<br />
Post your ideas here!<br />
<br />

<br />
May I humbly suggest:<br />
<br />
English, French, Germans (Holy Roman Empire), Byzantines, Turks, Russians, and perhaps a large but backward 'Neutrals' Civ, which can simulate 'minor player' civs like Scandinavia, Spain, Slavic states, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2001, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx for the input, Magnus!<br />
<br />
Well, the franks, the english and the germans/holy romans will be hard to avoid. But I'd like to put in some smaller tribes as well, so the objectives will be different from one tribe to another. The byzantines is also a good choice, as the byzantine empire played a huge part in the &quot;tech gaining&quot; from the arabs and the east. -that could be interesting -they have to hold the muslims back and keep the tech trade going.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking about letting the arabs, huns and mongols etc be represented by barbarians, or maybe one of those should be playable, for a different playing objective. But it's a huge job to set up an aggressive invasion force -they tend to be best played by the barbarians who will just attack and go on doing that forever. What about vastly advanced barbarians?<br />
<br />
I think that one scandinavian tribe should be in it, for the challenge of bringing christianity to the heathen north -also for great exploring adventures earlier in the game.<br />
<br />
What about Spain? Does anyone know something about the early history of Spain? I know that the arabs were there way up in the middle ages, but in later medieval times, Spain was THE dominant power in western Europe. How did they bring that about? -I'll go and research further on that one.<br />
<br />
I thought about including the russians, but the trouble might be, that they'll be too big a piece to swallow, both for me and for the player. The origin and history of Russia is quite complex, and I think it will be outside the scope of this patch. The impact on Europe rather came from the mighty hordes of huns, magyars and mongols -this shaped the history of Russia quite a bit, I should say. -So I guess the russians will be in it after all!<br />
<br />
Some other ideas I'm tumbling with:<br />
<br />
* Tech from conquest allowed<br />
* Huge barbarian cities to be conquered<br />
* Tribes being represented by &quot;grey eminences&quot; rather than &quot;all time leaders&quot;<br />
* Special powerful kings units, that are generated by events, upon the death of the king.<br />
* Strong feudal lords function as engineers upon the discovery of Feudalism- with fighting ability as well<br />
<br />
The map isn't really finished yet, but to give you an idea of the scope, the map is 150 x 200 tiles, and will look something like this :<br />

I would REALLY like to help you with the history of any nation in the Medieval Age.(Middelalderen, det ville gøre det lettere for os begge for vi er begge to danskere) I would like to suggest my self because I have got a 13 in every of my history tests and 11 in my gradebook every single time. (karakterbog, jeg går i 8.a, næsten 9.a) I could make a map for u that includes more of America to the end scenario which I suggest could be called: &quot;Dawn for/of Renaisance&quot; or maybe &quot;The Age og Discoveries&quot;. I also live in ODense, which probably could make it even more easier. I'd like to make a cooperation about this but it's only if u want to.<br />

<br />
-About the map, I don't think America should be in it (maybe except for &quot;Vinland&quot; to simulate the viking discovery), or players will sail over there in no time, long before intended. Maybe the american isles should be generated by an event, or maybe the &quot;spaceship&quot; could be used, so it's a race for the colonies, instead of a race to Alpha Centauri.<br />
<br />
On the other hand the map will be so absolutely huge, so that one might include the caribbean isles, without tribes noticing it before the right time -because there will be plenty of growth potential in Europe for a LONG time.<br />
<br />
-I'll ask Balsinde or Kindal about the spanish stuff. If you guys read this, do you have any ideas?<br />
<br />
Any ideas for how to simulate the growth of monasteries? I have thought about using them as terrains, or airbases (for monk paradropping... http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif). I even thought of including the Benedictines as a tribe. But somehow any of these options have disadvantages. The thing is, the primary &quot;research&quot; of the middle ages, took place in monasteries in remote places -not in cities- so the thing is: players should somehow be able to build these, and gain high science production from the effort.<br />

If so, the idea of the spaceship changed to discovery of America will be great. If you need to have the church in the game, because of their science, maybe you could make the Sct. Peter CHurch in too a wonder?? It should make people happier and increase science, this is just a perhaps! Maybe you could turn the huts into monasteries, so that the first to find them, gained an advantage (just like the huts!). I would like to know if you would make the partation of the Franks, in too the three parts, the later France, the later Germany and a last part which in some kind ended to be frontierland between the later France and later Germany.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2001, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I guess the wonder scheme will do the trick quite effectively. Your idea with the huts is also a good one. -right now they're ruins.<br />
<br />
-The basic premise is to make one great large scale scenario file to come with the patch. -which I know will be difficult (the simple solution would be to make several scenarios, but that's not my idea). You will be able to play a normal game without events, and pick from 21 tribes as to starting location etc., and play from say 500 A.D to 1500 A.D. over about 1000 turns. (or maybe less...)<br />
<br />
The scenario should provide specific events relating to the overall theme, and also preplaced cities and units etc. -But still allow for grand player freedom of choice, so that you get to decide which path of action to pursue. The franks will be in it -surely- but there's no way to change the name of tribes etc. So the franks will stay the franks all the way. As for every other tribe. Events might then create king units and announce the &quot;kingdom of france&quot; or something similar. That's why I'd like mysterious grey eminences to play out as leaders -which gives some historical freedom.<br />
<br />
What I'd like to simulate is the vast transformation of Europe that took place in the middle ages, from strong, feudal, agrarial-based societies and economies, military and government, over the development of knowledge in monasteries and changing in war techs, to the &quot;high life and creativity&quot; of the cities and the grand trade of the later medieval times. The player should get the feeling of a vastly transformed Europe, from the bare wilderness and ruins of the antique, to the fundament of the modern world (modern in sense of post-1500 terms). The main excitement will lie in the same things that made the original game so great, just in medieval terms. Exploring the vast, detailed and fertile lands, found new cities and develop useful techs for the benefit of the tribe.<br />

<br />
I'm planning to make just one set of files, on which one can then spawn off new medieval scenarios with minor effort. So I'll go into great detail with the techs, units, terrains and maps. I want to make very sure the tech tree is very balanced, and the tech pace feels right.<br />
<br />
-The scenario will then be sort of a bonus, to show off the possibilities. -And yes! This time you'll get those beloved Iceland and Greenland adventures!<br />
<br />
-Stormbringer, I will include Russia and the Mongol invasions. At least one of these should be playably, probably the russians, as the mongols can best be played by strong barb units. -On the other hand, there is something appealing about playing the great al-mighty Khan.... I might send you an email sometime -I don't know much about the history of Russia, and I'd very much appreciate your help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like an exciting project! This is a great idea!<br />
<br />
From a historical perspective, you're covering a huge time period so it'll be a little tricky to include what you want. Some additional suggestions for your major event list:<br />
<br />
1. The Renaissance (in 3 stages, the northern Italian Renaissance of 12th-13th centuries, the larger Italian Renaissance of 14th-16th centuries, the Northern European Renaissance of the 15th-17th centuries).<br />
2. The revolution in agricultural and mining technology in the 11th century that created the wealth that would fuel the Renaissance. <br />
3. The re-discovery of ancient Classical philosophical and technological texts, leading to the spread of universities.<br />
4. The overall relationship between Christendom and the Islamic empire(s). It begins (from the Christian perspective) in the 700s with the dual Islamic assaults on Iberia and the Pyrennes in the West and the creaking Khazar and Byzantine empires in the East. It ends with Christian victory in the West with the &quot;Reconquista&quot; of Iberia (1492 with the fall of Granada) and victory for Islam in the East with the fall of Constantinople in 1453. All is not conflict however - through the Islamic academic centers' preservation of classical Greek, Roman and Persian texts, the ancient technologies were re-discovered and improved upon by the brilliant university in Baghdad. These technologies (mathematics, engineering, sailing, astronomy, medicine, mining, military, banking, etc.) were transferred to Christendom via Jewish scholars and traders who translated the texts between Greek, Arabic, Latin, Persian and Turkish - or through simple conquest as Crusaders in Syria and Spain were shocked at the high level of Islamic technology they found in Cordoba or Dimashq. For instance, early European sailing technology was almost completely borrowed from the Arabs. <br />
5. Trade Routes: The collapse of the ancient Classical empires meant the collapse of the ancient trade routes that stretched from Rome to Nanjing. (Large amounts of hoarded Roman coins have been found in China.) The early Arab Islamic empires embraced trade and encouraged traders from all over to traverse their lands, leading slowly to the re-establishment of these routes - even during the Crusades. The Vikings participated enthusiastically in these trade routes down the Dniepr (founding Russia in the process), as well as the Huns (Hsong-nu), the Gepids, the Pechenegs, Mongols, etc. However, after the primitive Steppe Osmanli Turks seized control of the Islamic domains and established the Ottoman Empire (14th century), these routes were suddenly and dramatically cut. This in turn kicked off the European Age of Exploration and Conquest, as the Portuguese - followed by the Spanish, then the French, English and Dutch all went looking for sea routes to re-establish the old trade routes.     <br />
<br />
A suggested list of tribes:<br />
<br />
Franks, Lombards, Roman/Papal curia (Papal States), Byzantine/Eastern Roman Empire, Holy Roman Empire, Islamic empire, Spain, Poland-Lithuania, Bohemia, Hungary, Serbia, Rus, Vikings, Celts, England, Portugal, and perhaps a group called blandly &quot;The Steppe Peoples&quot; (representing Huns, Goths, Vandals, Scythians, Sarmatians, Gepids, Dacians, Magyars, Avars, Mongols, Pechenegs, Cumanians, Khazars, and all the other horse-mounted nomadic Steppe peoples who've invaded and established empires in Europe in this period).<br />
<br />
My input is history-oriented so I have no idea if this would be helpful for a strategy game like Civ. All the same, hope it helps - <br />

You just clarified a few things for me, that were a bit obscure. -I'm a history man myself (though still a student -going on tough for my 4th year, it seems), but there are only so few areas that I can know a great deal about. -such as german philosophy, the viking period, and Stanleys african expeditions... <br />
<br />
However, I am really into the middle ages, because this period (in the large scope) saw the origin of the modern state as we know it.<br />
How did it came about? I believe there are still many issues today that can be adressed by looking way back to the early history of Europe.<br />
<br />
 Originally posted by Vrylakas:<br />

<br />
-Yes, I know. I want to simulate the grand changes of Europe, so I'll have to leave many things out, or -at best- prepare the scenario carefully so as to set up conditions for the player(s), which will make history appear right in front of them.<br />
<br />
 Some additional suggestions for your major event list:<br />
<br />
1. The Renaissance (in 3 stages, the northern Italian Renaissance of 12th-13th centuries, the larger Italian Renaissance of 14th-16th centuries, the Northern European Renaissance of the 15th-17th centuries).<br />
<br />
The scenario will naturally end somewhere with this. But where it starts and ends will depend on the players. But naturally the rich North Italian cities will have a head start.<br />
<br />
 2. The revolution in agricultural and mining technology in the 11th century that created the wealth that would fuel the Renaissance.<br />
<br />
3. The re-discovery of ancient Classical philosophical and technological texts, leading to the spread of universities.<br />
<br />
-This will be a step of vital importance. I am planning to build the tech tree, so that it contains several stages of development. Techs gained from the antique via the arab world will be necessary to proceed with universities and allow further growth in knowledge. -The tribes will have differing advantages, geographically and economically, and of course the crusades will play an important role in this.<br />
<br />
 4. The overall relationship between Christendom and the Islamic empire(s).<br />
(...)<br />
Crusaders in Syria and Spain were shocked at the high level of Islamic technology they found in Cordoba or Dimashq. For instance, early European sailing technology was almost completely borrowed from the Arabs.<br />
<br />
-I believe some people would still today be shocked if they found out that peoples in the middle east actually has universities older than the european ones...<br />
<br />
The crusades will play an important role in the scenario. The european tribes will need advanced techs fighting it out with each other, and one way to get it, is to attack the arabs. Also, I'll put some of the great wonders in the middle eastern cities, so that tribes &quot;participating in the crusades&quot; will gain specific advantages.<br />
<br />
 5. Trade Routes: The collapse of the ancient Classical empires meant the collapse of the ancient trade routes that stretched from Rome to Nanjing. (Large amounts of hoarded Roman coins have been found in China.) The early Arab Islamic empires embraced trade and encouraged traders from all over to traverse their lands, leading slowly to the re-establishment of these routes - even during the Crusades. The Vikings participated enthusiastically in these trade routes down the Dniepr (founding Russia in the process), as well as the Huns (Hsong-nu), the Gepids, the Pechenegs, Mongols, etc. However, after the primitive Steppe Osmanli Turks seized control of the Islamic domains and established the Ottoman Empire (14th century), these routes were suddenly and dramatically cut. This in turn kicked off the European Age of Exploration and Conquest, as the Portuguese -followed by the Spanish, then the French, English and Dutch all went looking for sea routes to re-establish the old trade routes. <br />
<br />
-This is very complex, but in fact it really sums up the grand scope of this scenario, just from a little different perspective. This is very interesting -it definitely clarifies a few things for me.<br />
<br />
-The founding of the Ottoman empire is important. But I guess I will have to limit myself to one great &quot;arab&quot; tribe -with adjustments via events. But I see also very clearly now, that it has to be a &quot;civilized&quot; player tribe, because otherwise the tech from conquest won't work out. This will be what really triggers the crusades and the tech race. -the NEED for knowledge!<br />
<br />
For now, I have decided for the following player tribes for the scenario.<br />
<br />
-Franks/French<br />
-Holy Roman Empire<br />
-Byzantines<br />
-Anglo-Saxons/English<br />
-Danes/Vikings<br />
-Muslims/Arabs/Infidels<br />
-Rus/Russians<br />
<br />
The rest of the tribes will be simulated by &quot;barbarians&quot; -probably renamed to something a little more subtle. But I promise that Genghis Khan will still be a mighty opponent... -hey, where did the spaniards and germans go there...? -The papal curia has a special role in all this, and will interfer with the game whenever the pope sees fit... via the events-file...</div></div><hr />

It's definitely an interesting idea. What is your scenario about? I guess you'll be covering The Age of Discovery, Absolutism and Reformation, and the great religious wars? -In that case you might need a map covering also some parts of America and/or Africa/Asia, I guess.

Yes! But it's not really finished yet. You will also need some copies of my terrain files, to make it show up correctly, as I am using some special terrains -highlands, abbeys and dense forests.

<br />
I didn't think I'd have use of the text files (other than perhaps an Idea or two http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif )<br />
I have pretty much decided in which ways I am going to alter the files (you will be able to hire mercenaries for instance) and while my map doesn't cover America/Africa (I would have wanted it to but the 255 city limit wont allow it), I am trying to reflect it via techs (this is not nearly as good as including it on the map but what is there to do).<br />
The focus in my scenario will be on Reformation, absolutism and religious wars.<br />
Every player will have to pick his own religion.<br />
But just as you've said above I am trying to make every decision something the player will make, not the events.<br />
I was thinking about beginning my scenario in 1520 (since your Danish I guess you might be able to figure out why http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif ) but I could move it back a few years so that it begins when yours ends.<br />
<br />
There will also be bonuses for the first player to invent something, for instance the first player whit Pikes will get Tercios (the Habsburgs will have a lead in this department from the beginning though).<br />
<br />
The first civ to invent Tracee Italien will get a nice little unit called Vaubin, the only engineer in the game and this engineer will have quite good fighting abilities as well.<br />

  Yes! But it's not really finished yet. You will also need some copies of my terrain files, to make it show up correctly, as I am using some special terrains -highlands, abbeys and dense forests. I'll send you a copy when I finish. Off course, you can always alter it in any way you see fit.&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />

Some people play Civ because they love strategy games; I love the historical side of Civ. Your project really has me excited. I also find the European Middle Ages an exciting and formative period. <br />
<br />
 <br />
...but there are only so few areas that I can know a great deal about. -such as german philosophy, the viking period, and Stanleys african expeditions... <br />
<br />
<br />
Now where would a Dane learn about Vikings...?         http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
I wonder if/how you'll use feudalism and the growth of institutional structure &amp; bureaucracy? The importance of building political and organizational structures that transcended local ties laid the groundwork for early modern Europe. The struggles between Friedrich Barbarossa and the Papacy when their organizations began to overlap spared Europe from theocracy and a monolithic mass-imperial state (on the Eastern model). Any thoughts on this? <br />
<br />
I apologise for inundating you, but the idea is quite exciting to me. I know the game has its limitations, but building a historically accurate (but playable) scenario on the Middle Ages is a brilliant idea. By the way, excellent job on the map! <br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

About civilizations Spanish HAVE to be one, it was the most important power in Europe from XV to XVI century and the Spanish Crusade, &quot;the Reconquista&quot; is so important as could be the Eastern ones. To was very important the expanding of the kingdom of Aragon in the Mediterranean sea (Sicily, Cerdeña, Naples, Athens, Neophatry...) that caused some important conflicts agaisnt the Pope and France and then Spanish kingdom was which really discover America in 1492, and if the scenario finish in this age...<br />
I think that the most important groups of nations in the middle ages will be English,French, HRE (i don´t like the idea of joining Hanseastic league, Hasburgs,Saxons,Bavarias,Italian kingdom and Burgundians in one but...), Eastern Roman Empire, Iberian kingdoms, Scandinavians, Polish-Lithuanian,slavs as hungarians.<br />
I amnot sure about Russian importance in European affairs in the middle ages, I think that Polish could be more accurate, and would be challenge to create the big Polis-Lithuan commonwealth.<br />
I would include:<br />
*Spanish, their challenge would be the reconquista and then the expanding along the Mediterranean sea and North Africa.<br />
*English,defeat Irish,Scottish,Celts and stop the viings raids.<br />
*Fernch,try to expand their domains in Spain,Germany,Italy and England and be succesfull in the crusades.<br />
*HRE, expand their power to the East and North, Hanseatic league, teutonic domains, wars agaisnt the Pope...<br />
*Eastern Empire, stop the muslims is enough tough.<br />
*Normands(vikings), conquer England,France, some parts of Italy, and the Scandinvian expanding in modern Russia.<br />
*Polsih or Hungarians, I thinkt that Polish give more interest to Eastern affarirs.<br />
*Barbarians, muslims you can make them very agressive with moveunit command or creating unit via events.<br />

Yes, this will among the easy things to incorporate, as the CivII framework is neatly set up to simulate things exactly like this. -The changes in organizational government, city structures to lessen corruption, employment of churchmen to state service etc. There is obvious ways to simulate this.<br />
<br />
The investiture struggles between the german emperor and &quot;Hildebrand, false monk&quot; -and the other popes- will be events-generated. The UN and Eiffel tower wonders is renamed to something like &quot;The Papacy&quot; and &quot;Holy Roman Church&quot;, and this will make the player conquering these much stronger in diplomatic affairs. Also, there will be a powerful &quot;pope&quot; unit, which can be bribed or employed, to simulate things like the great schism, the antipope in Avignon etc.<br />

I thought you'd take a position like this! And your argument is very good. I really think too that the spaniards are too important to exclude. I think it's just that I know only so little about the history of Spain. But I see an interesting aspect from a players point of view. Spain really originated with the Aragon possessions and the reconquista, didn't it? -makes for an exciting player objective. I need to know more about this, but I'll delve deeply into my books all summer. -and I'll get back to you, when I have things more together.<br />
<br />
Your suggestions for the other tribes are also very good. I agree, the optimal thing would be to include all the historical tribes. But hopefully one will be able to use this patch to spawn off several lesser scenarios about specific historical situations. That's what I hope. This grand scenario will then simulate the &quot;epic&quot; of it all.<br />
<br />
This project won't be finished until the end of August or so. I just enjoy going around making research, new grapx, fixing the map and planning small schemes as to how to tweak the CivII framework and the techs in the right way. So I have no hurry. It will all be done carefully and right. I want to make very sure things feels right, especially in regard to the techs and the game pace.<br />

well, no exactly. When Muslims conquered the visigoth kingdom survived some center of resitence in the Norther Mountains. There were mainly 4:<br />
*Asturias:where expanded to SOuth formed the kingdom of Leon and Castile.<br />
*Navarre:who created a independent kingdom that was conquested by Catholic monarchs.<br />
*Aragon:which formed the kingdom of Aragon that when joined with Castile formed the actual Spain<br />
*Catalonia:which was a part of the Spanish mark of Charlemagne and then joined with Aragon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vrylakas</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2001, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Ok, I wasn't going to say it but kIndal is correct; Poland was more important to Western and Central European history in the Middle Ages than Russia. I have a bias; while I now live in the U.S.A. my family is from Poland. <br />
<br />
However, Old Rus (capital at Kiev/Kiiv) had minimal relations with anyone in Europe except for the Byzantine Empire and Serbia. When the Mongols struck in 1239, Rus was destroyed and its successor states in the north (Novgorod, Moskva, etc.) were almost sealed off completely from the rest of Europe until Ivan Grozny (&quot;the Terrible&quot;) in the 16th century. From then on Russia had increasingly intense diplomatic relations with the West, but the real relationship between Russia and the West begins with Piotr/Peter I at the end of the 17th century, with that damned Great Northern War that Denmark, Poland-Lithuania and Sweden all lost, and Russia won... Russia has loomed over European history ever since, but as many historians point out Russia never experienced the Renaissance or Enlightenment. <br />
<br />
Nobody knows when Poland was created, but we know the emperor Otto I complained about Poland to a Jewish envoy (Ibn Jakub) for the Cordoba caliphate in 963, and Rome recognized us three years later. In 1241 when the Mongols reached Poland, German and Polish knights stood side by side at Legnica - and were slaughtered together. The 3rd oldest university in Central Europe was established in Krakow (now called the Jagiellonian University/Uniwersitet Jagiellonski), although there were already schools all over Poland by then - witness Kopernik. Poland expanded for a couple centuries (conquering Kiev, and the English-Danish king Canut is half Polish through his mother) but after warring unsuccessfully with the Lithuanians we decided in 1386 to join countries under a Lithuanian dynasty, the Jagiellos. In 1410 and again in the 1450s the combined Polish-Lithuanian armies defeated the Teutonic Knights (capturing Marienburg) and made Prussia a Polish possession for two centuries. Polish-Lithuanian armies repeatedly defeated the Turks (Chocim especially) and Russians (Smolensk spent a couple centuries under Polish-Lithuanian rule), occupied Moscow (1610-1613; remember Boris Gudanov?) and before the final destruction drove the Turks away from Vienna in 1683. The 18th century was mostly downhill, ending in the disaster of 1795. Most modern Europeans think of Poland as the constant victim of Russia and Germany, but in the Middle Ages Poland-Lithuania was a major Central European power famous for its winged cavalry. There's a obelisk in Rome that refers to Poland as &quot;Antemurale christianitatis&quot;; (Bulwark of Christendom) because of the wars against the Russians and Turks.<br />
<br />
Sorry about the lecture - I was going to hold my peace and let you develop your patch on your own terms with a few general  suggestions. However, kIndal let the proverbial cat out of the bag and I let it all out. Sorry again. I mentioned Serbia and Hungary in my original post because they too played crucial roles in European Medieval history, though few recognize this now. (For instance, the successful rise of the Habsburgs in the Holy Roman Empire is largely because of the interference of a Hungarian king, Matthias; and bells ring at noon across the West today because of a Hungarian victory over the Turks at Nandorfehervar/modern Belgrade in the mid-15th century. The Bohemians also gave birth to Europe's first successful Protestant movement under Jan Hus in 1415 - a century before Martin Luther and who was influenced by the Englishmen John Wycliff - and whose general Jan Zizka introduced the first form of mobile &quot;armored&quot; warfare that was copied throughout Europe right up til the Russian Civil War of 1917-1922.) It is the fashion now in European historiography to assume that because the last 3 centuries have been almost completely dominated by the Atlantic Western states, that ALL of European history must have revolved around them; unfortunately, Europe is culturally far richer than that... <br />
<br />
Sorry again - Clearly you will never accomodate all nations in your patch, nor should you attempt to. As well, as I've mentioned before, the time period you're covering is immense and one of great change. Even the players are different from beginning to end. However, if accuracy is your aim...<br />

Another very underestimated tile improvement is the Airbase, it will give one extra food, it will count as stackable and as a road/railroad and you can make details of it change colour depending on its ownership, apart from all this it is usable as a normal airbase and will change apearance when an air unit refuels in it.<br />

Leading unfortunately to the myth of World War II that Polish mounted cavalry, armed only with lances, attacked German Panzer columns - an untruth. <br />
<br />
 <br />

Yes, the day of the mounted charge had passed with the onset of coordinated and trained infantry - especially when firearms entered the scene. Swiss pikemen were defeating mounted knights in the late 1400s. Still, the Poles were able to drive the Swedes, Tartars and Russians out of Poland by the 1660s in the 'Deluge' wars. <br />

Sorry about the lecture - I was going to hold my peace and let you develop your patch on your own terms with a few general suggestions.<br />
<br />
-I am following all this with great interest! So don't be sorry, this is exactly what I need to get this together in a balanced way. I will harshly and ruthlessly decide what to leave out. But as I said earlier, I can only know so little, and it is really great to get some different opinions about what is important and what is not. I found the polish stuff very inspiring.<br />
<br />
 HENRIK:<br />
They don't teach you about Stockholms bloodbath in Denmark?<br />
<br />
Actually I had a friend who wrote an assignment about this, but it seems I never really found out what it was about... But I feel something emerging from the deep, dark abyss of my mind...<br />
<br />
The primary focus of danish history teaching (in schools) seems to be the german occupation of Denmark in 1940-45 and the resistance movement etc... greatly overestimated in my opinion -and also in most scholars I think. History teaching is really too oldfashioned. In the early grades, you get the ancient stuff, the stone age etc. Then you get some medieval history, reformation etc. and in the later grades you get modern history, WWII etc.<br />
<br />
The way it works at the university, is that you get 3 long-length courses covering all of history, from the babylonians to the space race. Within these you specialize in smaller subjects, which you can delve deeply into. Some are offered as classes, others are self-studies, and you can choose depending on your interest. Gone are most of the royal succession-stuff and the useless handready regnal years of kings etc. -which tended to be very nationalistic anyway, and not very focused on explaining what happened, and the causes bringing the changes about. -Which is what history is about to me.<br />
<br />
It is a strength, because students become very specialized, and know a lot about small areas. But &quot;normal&quot; people tend to think of it as a weakness, because they expect a historian to know all of history -which is impossible, except in a very broad way.<br />
<br />
 HENRIK:<br />
...you cannot change a terrains defence bonus or movement cost though.<br />
<br />
BUT YES! You can! What makes you say so? There are specific parameters for exactly those in the rules.txt! -it is the first parameters, if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
 HENRIK:<br />
Another very underestimated tile improvement is the Airbase, it will give one extra food, it will count as stackable and as a road/railroad and you can make details of it change colour depending on its ownership, apart from all this it is usable as a normal airbase and will change apearance when an air unit refuels in it.<br />
<br />
Interesting. I might rethink my use for this field. The downfall is that AI players rarely build these -if they don't have a bunch of air units, that is, which they won't have in a medieval scenario.<br />
<br />
-Keep the comments rolling! This is very inspiring!<br />

<br />
Yes, I was thinking of that the other night while watching an otherwise decent history film in which 17th century soldiers were hitting their targets nearly every time with their wheel lock and flintlock smoothbore muskets. And indeed cavalry could still be grimly effective in special conditions; if however these conditions were not present (wide open dry plain to charge on with minimal physical obstacles) the result could be deadly for the cavalry. <br />

Thanks for the link to the scenario; I'll give it a try. Yes, Polish peasant revolts played a role in the ousting of the Swedes (but not the Russians or Tartars; that was the regular forces). The Poland of 1660 was a mere shadow of the Poland of 1560, largely because the Jagiellonian dynasty had lapsed and the nobility (szlachta) had taken over, electing weak kings. In fact, when the Deluge wars started there was a Swedish dynasty sitting on the Polish-Lithuanian throne, the Catholic half of the Vasas (Polish: Waza). The treaty that ended the Deluge wars between Poland and Sweden forced the Catholic (Polish) Vasas to renounce their claims to the Swedish throne. <br />
<br />
Oh, how our histories are so intertwined... <br />

In fact, when the Deluge wars started there was a Swedish dynasty sitting on the Polish-Lithuanian throne, the Catholic half of the Vasas (Polish: Waza). The treaty that ended the Deluge wars between Poland and Sweden forced the Catholic (Polish) Vasas to renounce their claims to the Swedish throne. <br />
Oh, how our histories are so intertwined... <br />

&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/redface.gif&quot; border=0&gt; I just remembered one thing though, i forgot to mention the Polish claims to the Swedish throne in my scenario &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/redface.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />
This was one of the reasons for the war (actually I think it was the official reason for Swedens invassion, even though territorial gain was one the real reason).<br />
If you play the scenario as the Swedish and think that the Polish are too easy, wait untill you take Krakow, remember what ignited the first of the revolts?<br />
Well it works here too, and I would be very suprised if someone manage to conquer all of Poland and just keeping what you've got is unlikely too (or is supposed to be annyway).<br />

The primary focus of danish history teaching (in schools) seems to be the german occupation of Denmark in 1940-45 and the resistance movement etc... greatly overestimated in my opinion -and also in most scholars I think. History teaching is really too oldfashioned. In the early grades, you get the ancient stuff, the stone age etc. Then you get some medieval history, reformation etc. and in the later grades you get modern history, WWII etc.<br />
<br />
Swedish schools suck when it comes to teaching history, acording to one teacher my brother had, Skåne would have been purchased by Sweden back in the dark ages, this was ofcourse not true, the reallity was much more complicated.<br />
<br />
In Swedish schools you first learn about the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age (not sure that the last one is the correct english term) then we have to learn about the swedish kings during the time when Sweden was a Great Power (but most of what they teach is just worthless rubish)<br />
And then they start all over whit a quick rebriefing of the Stone/Bronze/Iron age. Followed by some info about the world in the 1700's and then its the revolutions and then its industrialization, and so on (thats  about where I am schoolwise right now).<br />
Also all of it is very Swedo-centric.<br />
<br />
If one wants to learn stuff one needs to get books and find it out for oneself.<br />
<br />
Sorry about the lecture on Swedish schools, while I do prefer history before some other subject in school I still think it is managed in a very sad way http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />
<br />
The reason for my reaction about Stockholms bloodbath was perhaps becouse it is so emphesised in Sweden, I couldn't imagine that they don't bring even bring it up in Denmark.<br />
I guess I have gotten somewhat affected by our bad history education (so far, hopefully it will be better when I get older). http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/grad.gif<br />
<br />
<br />
 <br />
It is a strength, because students become very specialized, and know a lot about small areas. But &quot;normal&quot; people tend to think of it as a weakness, because they expect a historian to know all of history -which is impossible, except in a very broad way.<br />

Which do you think you will use? I suggest Feudalism (Where it is not a senate but a Reichscouncil), Absolutism, Christian Fundamentalism (Crusader units could be a special unit here if you could do that), maybe some kind of Arabian government for the OSmans and abasids empire, remember they have never really gotted their dividation of church and state. Maybe some kind of Ortodox government or Lutheranian government.<br />
<br />
I mean that Morten has written that all the civs should be there from the start, but at 700 after christ there wasn't so many of the countries &quot;made&quot;, there should be dominating later on. The prespanish kingdom was just overrun by the arabs. If they're going to be a part of the game, the spanish, they should start with only one humble city in Navarra.<br />
<br />
The papal state was there, the byzantian empire was there, the arab empire, the frankish empire, and some few anglo-british tribes had made there one states. Wessex, Mercia and Essex and all of them. Here's another thing I would like to add: It is amazing that the viking invasion of England actually united these countries in to a single english kingdom which William the Conquerror's dynasty should rule for a long time.<br />
<br />
ABout Scandinavia. The danish kingdom should be the strongest. From 1000-1500 the danes were the dominating power in the North. This balance changed when the swedes conquered Finland from 1550 to 1814 the swedes were the dominating. THere for I suggest If you only need one scandinavian country this shoul either be called the danes or the vikings.<br />
<br />
MY SUGGESTIONS TO CIV'S:<br />
Arabs<br />
Byzantians,<br />
Franks,<br />
Anglo-britains<br />
Papal state<br />
Poles<br />
A sort of Balkanstate ( A kind of pre-Austria-Hungary) where the serbs, hungarians and austrians should be together, or at least the serbs and the hungarians<br />
Holy Roman Empire (Shall the dividation of the HRE be included in this mod-pack?)<br />
A Northitalian  (Maybe called the Medecinians??) state which could provide science and start the Renaissance<br />

<br />
<br />
Isnt it a little early for Absolutism? The scenario suposedly ends in 1492...<br />
<br />
Although many dreamt of Absolutism I don't think it was achieved untill later on.<br />

<br />
Correction:<br />
Finland was conquered by sweden in the 12th century.<br />
Swedish Crusaders &quot;converted&quot; it and made it part of Sweden.<br />
Swedens rise to power was in around 1500 (I would say 1520) but for other reasons.<br />
<br />
  <br />
 THere for I suggest If you only need one scandinavian country this shoul either be called the danes or the vikings.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would sugest Vikings and make one Swedish city up in the Mälare viking (the only swedish vikings that actually existed lived in that region, still our nationalists think that Swedes=Vikings in the past &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/frown.gif&quot; border=0&gt; )<br />

In my scenario I will use them to reflect the different schisms in the cristhian church, there will be:<br />
 <br />
  Cristhian Monarchy (monarchy)<br />
  Catholic Monarchy (comunnism, this symbolises the counter reformed nations, the corruption is adjusted slightly and all infiltrators and ambassadors (diplos and spies) will be veterans due to the fact that catholic papal envoys and such allways where used as good spies)<br />
  Protestant Monarchy (Republic, later on there will be centers of administration whit very high upkeep that will function as police stations and thus eliminate unhappiness from millitary units being away from cities, due to the high upkeep these will only be built in large cities (unless you feel like ruining your economy)  and symbolisis the growing bureocracy of the new states. Womens suffrage will be an extremly usefull wonder in my scenario for protestant nations).<br />
  Catholic Commonwealth (given to the polish when the right year comes around(or when they achieve something, I have not decided yet) the hussar will function as the fanatic unit and the polish will be very powerfull indeed for a while, later they will probably lag behind to to lack of research though(a human player might not stay in comonwealth forever)).<br />
 Protestant Republic (Democracy, given to English and Dutch, can also be aquired by a third nation if they have built Geheime Kabinetts-Kanzlei(great library)) <br />
<br />
You can ofcourse not use the same ones since that wouldn''t be accurate to the time period, but perhaps something simmilar.<br />
Government changing will be allowed in my scenario and large nations (like the habsburgs and France) &lt;u&gt;are&lt;/u&gt; more likely to pick catholisism due to the free support. <br />
<br />
Playtesting will show if this actually works but this is how I intend to do it.</div></div><hr />

It could make the arabs being able to build a special arab unit and it could also increase trade in town? WHat about a wonder called Venice's Harbor? VEnice was one of the greatest trading places in EUrope in the meddieval age. This wonder could also be called Hanseatic League.

I think this is an excelent idea (as an end game wonder).  But I doubt that the ones that was &quot;absolute in the begining&quot; really was absolute, many rulers could basically decide whatever they wanted to (I seem to recal someone who tried to decide what cloths thier subjects would be allowed to wear. He died believing that everyone obeyed his orders, never leaving his castle, this person would be &quot;absolute&quot; in his mind but not in reality, I don't know if this story is true but it ilustrates pretty well how medieval monarchies worked) but nobody outside thier royal chambers would care.<br />

<br />
-Ah! Now I understand. -I haven't exactly noticed it in the game, as I have assigned the same bonuses to these squares. I guess you're right. This doesn't matter so much to me, though.<br />
<br />
   HENRIK:<br />

This can also be used to some extent to manipulate AI expansion...<br />
<br />
Interesting! Please give me something further on this! I don't get exactly what you're pointing to, but this sounds definitely worth getting a little into.<br />
<br />
   PTOLEMY:<br />
Ahm, I was wondering of the governments...<br />
<br />
There'll be free choice of government form, but the techs required will be divided into &quot;epochs&quot; where you will need the concluding tech to proceed to the next epoch. The only tribe who will be ahead in techs to begin with is the arab tribe, so you'll need first to develop/trade techs within the &quot;dark age&quot;, to proceed to feudalism, and/or get the crusades going to get advanced techs from the next epochs.<br />
<br />
epoch 1 (all dark age techs) --&gt; epoch 2 (feudal techs) --&gt; epoch 3 (high medieval techs) --&gt; etc.     <br />
<br />
This is a very useful way of also setting up the units, because they will be connected to specific techs within each epoch -this makes it possible to control which units will appear approximately when, in a game.<br />
<br />
Concerning government types, I have the following until further.<br />
<br />
Tribal Kingdom (despotism)<br />
Monarchy (monarchy)<br />
Feudalism (communism)<br />
Trade League (fundamentalism)<br />
Feudal Empire (republic)<br />
Holy Empire (democracy).<br />
<br />
All these will be adjusted, as to support for units etc. to fit the changing circumstances. I still have some consideration. Fundamentalism is a very warfit governmental form, so this might be changed. But fundy's tend also to get very very rich. I might reconsider something here.<br />
<br />
   PTOLEMY:<br />
Absolutism: I am not sure but in the osman and russian empire, at least in the start, they had absolut leaders. I also think that the hungarians had and the franks in the start.<br />
<br />
There's no kind of absolutism in western Europe before the 17th century. It is true that the eastern parts of Europe to at large degree had &quot;absolute&quot;-like rulers way down from the middle ages, which was partly inherited from the harsh rule imposed by the many invaders, including the mongols. But the feudal structure of western Europe seemed to lay quite a damper on the power of individual kings. There were great rulers like Charlemagne and Barbarossa and others. But their power consisted in their ability to unite the landbased nobility under their rule, by force, allegiance or tradition. When they died, their empires often split into fractions, and wars between the different noble families was not uncommon. So medieval rulers in general (in western Europe) did not possess absolute power. They had to ask the nobles. Or gain the power to crush them, and get them into the fold.<br />
Often the church would be a powerful ally to the kings, in these disputes.<br />
<br />
  PTOLEMY:<br />
I think also we could start talking about units here. Should there be special units for some civ's? Which and to who? <br />
<br />
Any ideas? I'd like also to hear ideas for objectives for the different tribes.<br />
<br />
   PTOLEMY:<br />
I mean that Morten has written that all the civs should be there from the start, but at 700 after christ there wasn't so many of the countries &quot;made&quot;, there should be dominating later on.<br />
<br />
-ABOUT tribes. Until further I have settled for the following tribes. (I know I changed my mind before, so I might do it again...) The tribes and their primary playing objectives.<br />
<br />
-Franks<br />
-carve out charlemagnes empire and participate in the crusades, in the middle east and in spain<br />
-Anglo-Saxons<br />
-fight the danes/northmen, unite the isles and fight the 100 years war against the french<br />
-Holy Romans<br />
-unite the fragments of central Europe to a strong christian empire to face the muslim threat<br />
-Danes/Northmen<br />
-carve out a nordic empire, will have powerful ships, to sail up the rivers as far as Byzantium etc. <br />
-Spaniards<br />
-struggle against the arabs and franks to carve out the late medieval glory of spain, and send off Columbus<br />
-Infidels<br />
-diverse arab tribes united under one hat. They NEED to be a player tribe to simulate the tech gaining from the middle east. they have one goal : keep Jerusalem and Constantinople, and conquer as much of Europe as possible.<br />
-Inferiors<br />
-I don't think the Byzantines can be referred to as &quot;inferior&quot;, but the inferiors will contain most of the &quot;civilized&quot; tribes spread unevenly around, poles, serbs, byzantines etc. I might come up with another concept, but this is it until further.<br />
-Raging Hordes<br />
-BARB's with strong horsemounted units invading from the steppes of Asia, featuring Djengis Khan and Attila the Hun (in reverse order)<br />
<br />
The way I want to simulate the rise of different kingdoms etc, is by creating &quot;kings&quot; units, upon specific player actions, there could very well be a king in every other major city. The tribes will be represented diplomacy-wise by highly influential clerical figures or grey eminences, who will wander through time, as their kings die and are replaced by others. This is a little concept to simulate the everlasting wheel of power, which I think will be quite nice. Kings and leaders are not nearly as important as the concept of power.<br />
<br />
   PTOLEMY:<br />
Wonders: Should the normally ancient wonders be in the scenario?? Should the Kaabah be a wonder? It could make the arabs being able to build a special arab unit and it could also increase trade in town? WHat about a wonder called Venice's Harbor? <br />
<br />
I haven't thought about this in such great detail. I will grab whatever wonders I need to characterize the tribes, and give them benefits and advantages etc. This won't be an objective scenario, so most wonders should be buildable upon discovering certain techs. Most preplaced wonders will be in Jerusalem, and the important middle eastern cities, to really get the crusades going. -I have thought about Venice. I know one thing, the city should have growth and trade potential.<br />
<br />
-Otherwise, all city improvements and wonders, units etc. will be altered, and used for sinister purposes, to tweak the game mechanics in whatever way I need. I'd like to hear ideas for these! I will probably use many of the ideas incorporated into my viking scenario. RR's will be Royal Highways, and possible with the better roadbuilding and infrastructure of later 14th and 15th century centralized medieval times. I will include musketeers units, pirates, the revolution of gunpowder and cannonballs. Banks will be in it, but probably renamed and follow other specific techs, according to need. There should be at least one city improvement of each kind (economic, happy, scientific) within each &quot;epoch&quot;, maybe more if circumstances permit. There should also be both defensive and offensive units available in all &quot;epochs&quot;.<br />
<br />
The final epoch will be the renaissance, and so these times will be included to some degree, including the beginning of the age of exploration etc.<br />
<br />
-Quite long posts in this thread! Hope I don't bore you to death!<br />
Keep up your ideas coming!<br />
<br />
Yours Truly,<br />
Morten<br />

<br />
When you edit the map in the mapeditor you can separate landmasses whit water, then when you start on &quot;a premade world&quot; to make the scenario, the landmasses will be numbered beside the coordinates if you look at them whit &quot;view peices&quot; those numbers are the continent numbers, now if you put land between those landmasses, the game will still look at them as separete continents since thats what they where when the map was created whit the mapeditor, separete land masses means 50% higher caravan revune when a traderoute is started from a city on another continent.<br />
For instance in my scenario Italy has been made a separete continent (I changed the alps to water in the mapeditor) then when I changed it back whit cheatmode I had  a new &quot;continent&quot;: Italy, caravans from the rest of Europe will now yield 50% better revuene when trading whit Italian cities!</div></div><hr />

 HENRIK:<br />
Charlamange? (not sure when he lived though, I am not that good at the early middle ages).<br />
<br />
Charlemagne, also known as Charles the Great, was king of the Frankish Empire 768-814, also known as the Carolingian Empire. In 800 A.D. Charlemagne was coronated by Pope Leo III and proclaimed ruler of the Holy Roman Empire, by this forging a strong alliance with the christian church. Before this, he fought a massive number of campaigns in western Europe, carving out a grand empire, stretching from Saxony in the North to Barcelona and Rome in the south. He is known for &quot;the intellectual revival of the carolingians&quot; -which basically means that he tried to impose old roman imperial customs and values on his empire -and succeeded too. Under his rule, western Europe experienced an flourishing of ancient knowledge etc. Even though he was more of a warrior man himself, he knew the benefit of a strong administration with learned men as officials etc. Upon his death in 814, his empire split into 3 fractions. The western parts (present day france) -governed by Charles the Bald, the eastern empire (present day Germany) governed by the rightful heir to the throne Louis the Pious, and the &quot;middle kingdom&quot; (which soon disintegrated into numerous petty kingdoms) governed by one other son, named Lothar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vrylakas</div><div class="date">Jun 14, 2001, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello all,<br />
<br />
Morten - I've just read your progress run down, and it looks great! I'm especially impressed with the governments. <br />
<br />
Henrik:<br />
<br />
   <br />
From Henrik's post:<br />
I wasn't saying that they should get thier own civ (i don't know that much about early Austria) but they shouldn't be grouped together whit the Hungarians, Transylvanians, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Austria/Oesterreich is a relative newcomer to Europe. Wien/Vienna is much younger than Praha, Krakow or Buda-Pest. While its German population derives from Charlemagne's Ostmark wars, an Austrian &quot;state&quot; really only began to form as a Catholic, Habsburg counter-weight to the rise of Prussia in the 18th century. The name Austria was only officially used after the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806. Hungary wasn't joined to the Habsburg empire until 1526 (when the northern part not conquered by the Turks reverted to Habsburg rule), but really not til the late 1680s when the Habsburg (and Polish) armies cleared the northern Balkans of the Turks. The Habsburgs didn't enter into the power-sharing agreement with the Austrians until the 'Ausgleich' of 1867, after they lost the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.  <br />
  <br />
   <br />
From Ptolomy:<br />
Also there was a really great hungarian king, I think his name was Matthyas or something like that, he built a beautiful castle this could be a wonder which would allow Absolutism. Because Mathyas was able to build it because that he was an absolut king. I'll find out what this king was named and what the castle's name is. <br />
<br />
<br />
King Mattyas ruled Hungary with an iron fist from 1458-1490. He is better known in the West by his Latin name, Matthias - and because his family had a raven on their coat-of-arms, he is known as Matthias Corvinus (Corvin  = raven). Matthias maintained one of the largest libraries in Renaissance Europe, so today one of Hungary's best publishing houses is called Corvina. <br />
<br />
Matthias' family, in Hungarian known as Hunyadi, were the result of a combined Hungarian-Romanian marriage; &quot;Hunyadi&quot; is the Magyarized form of the Romanian &quot;Hunedoara&quot; from current-day Cluj-Napoca (old Hungarian &quot;Kolozsvar&quot;, German &quot;Klausenburg&quot;) in Transylvania.<br />
<br />
Matthias' father, Janos (John), was famous for his wars against the Turks. He also built the powerful castle in Transylvania you probably are writing about, called Vajdahunyadvar. It was Janos who defeated the Turks at Nandorfehervar/Belgrade in 1456, for which the church bells across Christendom were ordered to ring at noon (which they still do) by Pope Calixtus III. Matthias was not supposed to become king in 1458, but he usurped the throne and became a kind of Hungarian David - remember David's Biblical parable about splitting the baby in two? Mattias made up for political illegitimacy by building huge monuments and engaging in foreign adventures. He built a beautiful Renaissance court at Buda castle and invited the great architects and artists from Italy. (Buda was a series of royal hilltop castle-fortresses on the left bank of the Danube/Duna River dating back to pre-Roman times, with over time a small market-town for the beourgoisie across the river called Pest. When western Hungary was the Roman province of Pannonia, Buda was known as Aquincum. The two were united in 1873 to form Budapest...) After some initial victories over the Turks in Bosnia, Matthias turned towards a dream: to create a Danubian empire. He fought a series of wars against Bohemia, Poland-Lithuania and the Holy Roman Empire over his last 20 years. He did not succeed in creating the empire, but he did manage to seize Vienna and make it his capital - where he was likely murdered by poison in 1490, by one of his own court. Ironically, his Danubian empire was realized by one of his rivals, a Jagiellonian from Poland, a few decades after Matthias' death. The new king of Hungary then, Wladyslaw II (Hungarian - &quot;Ulaszlo&quot;) was a Polish Jagiellonian who ruled Hungary and Bohemia, but was incompetent. Hungary was conquered by the Turks at the battle of Mohacs shortly after his death....<br />
<br />
Note: Hungary was not an absolutist monarchy. I've already blistered here about Western stereotypes of non-Atlantic Europe. Before the Hunyadis took over Hungary, it was ruled (from the early 14th century) by the Anjou family (of Burgundy and Napoli fame). When the Hungarian nobility elected the first Anjou, Charles Robert, to the throne, they forced him to sign guarantees of their freedoms that guaranteed there would never be an absolute monarchy. It worked; there never was until the Sultan Mehmet II seized Hungary in 1526. <br />
<br />
In fact, as Henrik has already alluded to, Poland had a similar situation - and this was not a coincidence. It's a little complicated, but essentially Poland in the mid-1300s was ruled by one of the Hungarian Anjou kings, Ludwik (Hungarian: Lajos). When the Polish nobility elected him, a deal was struck guaranteeing noble freedoms in Poland perpetually - and they are known in Polish history as the Hungarian freedoms. The Jagiellonians were able to balance their power with these freedoms during their dynasty (1386-1572), but when the last Jagiellonian died the nobility elected weak kings (like the Catholic Swedish Vasas) and ruined the country through their selfish exploitation. <br />
<br />
To illustrate this, in 1572 Polish envoys were sent to France to convince the French Prince Henri de Valois to become king of Poland. After accidentally witnessing the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day, they brought Henri back to the royal capital at Krakow (January, 1574). Charles IX, king of France, died in May. By June, Henri practically escaped from Poland back to France to become king of France. To quote the British historian Norman Davies, &quot;It is hard to see how the untried, republican constitution of Poland-Lithuania could ever have been smoothly operated by a youthful prince whose meagre experience was confined to an absolutist court and to sectarian warfare.&quot; (Davies, 1982: pg. 420)<br />
<br />
Poland, Hungary and Bohemia belong to a region identified as &quot;Eastern Central Europe&quot;, an extension of the West; poorer and less developed, but nonetheless societies whose basic values were shaped by the common experience of the West. They parttook in the Renaissance, built universities, and developed socially much like Germany, France, etc. Their great tragedy was being overrun by Eastern empires; the Turks, the Russians, and the reactionary Habsburgs. I would like to remind the readers here that Prague is many kilometers west of Vienna, and indeed in the late Middle Ages Vienna was less culturally (and economically) developed than Prague, Krakow or Buda-Pest. <br />
<br />
Sorry for lecturing again, but I was provoked...    &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/rolleyes.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />
<br />
And with the above, you can see my 4 years in a Hungarian university now...  <br />

<br />
-Good idea. I had something like this in mind. -But I think that they'll be closely associated with the relevant techs. So that it is more the techs they posess which characterize the tribes. Like the vikings possessing the longship tech -so they can build longships. These techs can be traded of course, but some will exclude others, so that some units will be obsolete if you possess more advanced techs. This will work quite nicely I think. -I will go into more detail with this when I start to get the tech tree done.<br />

-Well, I guess somewhere ultimo August or so. Right now I've just finished with making the basic graphics layout (terrains &amp; cities graphics). And I finished the main (western) parts of the map! What a huge job that is, to make this map! Phew! -But it will be great when it's done.<br />
<br />
Next is to finally get the tribes represented on the map, and get the tech tree done. Fortunately my last scenario &quot;hammer&quot; taught me many a great lesson in this regard, so I'll be able to do it with a minimum of fuss. -BUT, once I get going, I want to finish it. What I really will need is loads of playtesting and neatening when the time comes, for WHICH I am counting on you guys! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it's coming together, slowly. I am -slowly- getting the map finished, and I want this as geographically correct, as visually interesting, and game-balancing/inspiring as possible. But I need to do most of it before I start positioning cities etc. It would be an enormous job to find out something should be changed, and start all over, once I start off doing the &quot;real&quot; scenario.<br />
<br />
-It's the quiet before the storm, before I really go to work with the techs -which I KNOW will be far the hardest part of all this!<br />
<br />
I have started to set up the unit graphics too, and I have been playing some of the other medieval scens around, to get inspiration etc. Btw, have any of you guys played the 100 years war scenario that is available in the downloads? I think it is really quite challenging, and fun too. (Especially playing the french! Ouch! Do they get smacked!)<br />
<br />
Are there other medieval scenarios around, that I definitely would want to take a look at before I do this one? I have seen &amp; played many, but maybe you have some favourites?<br />
<br />
 KINDAL:<br />
Why not better &quot;Independents&quot;?<br />
This cannot be played, can it?<br />
<br />
I have decided to include the Byzantines afterall, so the barbs will have to simulate all of the &quot;inferior&quot; tribes. -And these cannot be played of course.<br />
<br />
The Eastern Roman Empire really is sort of important, I think, and I won't waste a tribe position with a non-playable tribe. And barbs are easy to characterize by differing city styles and the simple unit types they produce. So barbs in the north will produce vikings, barbs in the east mongol horsemen, barbs in scotland highlander type units, etc. And, not to forget, polish barbs will be highly sofisticated nobles with strong cavalry.<br />
<br />
I'll go into greater detail about these things. I'd like to hear more about what different unit types you'd like to see in the game. Within the different groups, infantry, horsemounted/knights, heavy siege engines, ships, and special type units. What do you think are the important developments? The stirrup should surely have an important effect on the efficiency of cavalry. How about naval developments (about which I know some, but not all), plate armor, crossbows, the holy inqusition, etc. Any good ideas about what kind of units can be associated to techs? -that is, to specific, important developments? -or ideas for special type events upon a certain discovery or conquest.<br />
<br />
I have decided to avoid year-sensitive events. Events will be triggered by important player or AI actions, like the conquest of certain cities or development of certain techs. Any ideas on those?<br />
<br />

<br />
Good suggestions, there. What did steel bring about? How was that invented? -What made the new techs superior? Bronze is a very soft metal, so it has obvious disadvantages in weapons. Hardened iron (and steel?) surely was a great improvement from the early weaponry of the bronze/iron age. What about strategy, army organization, siege techniques, castles etc. How did that develop over time?<br />
<br />
  MAGNUS:<br />
Morten, I suggest limiting/disabling Diplomats - there is nothing worse than building magnificent Barbarian cities and then having Civs being able to bribe them really cheap<br />
<br />
Yes. No tribe will have diplomats in the early game. But I'll include missionaries, monks, bishops and assassins when the appropriate techs are reached. They'll be diplomat type units. Medieval societies did have diplomatic relations, which followed closely their trade connections etc. And assassins and spies were used very much in the same way they were used later on. To inspect military improvements, army sizes, bribery etc. All the usual stuff.<br />
<br />
  HENRIK:<br />
I think you should change the barbarian govt to fundamentalist whit hexediting<br />
<br />
Good idea. I can do this with CivTweak/CivCity I think. -The price of bribery is closely linked to the amount of money the barbs have. Fundy will be a good way to make sure this doesn't drop dramatically. -Also, WHO founded the cities is important. If barbs are made the founder of the city (with CivCity) they'll behave pretty much like all other cities.<br />

Your idea is great! I have been working for a time now on a very similar project, except that mine is more of an &quot;Antiquity patch&quot; than a &quot;Medieval patch&quot;. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I would love to help out with your project. I have studied history like yourself, and have a great interest in the subject. I have lots of big heavy books, and more importantly: a lot of very detailed maps. They might come in handy you know. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif I am Norwegian, from Christianssand (founded by Danish king Christian IV). If you want, you can mail me at: tos77@excite.com<br />

<br />
I have lots of comments to your project, but don't have time for it all right now. ONe thing though:<br />
You have mentioned Clovis and Attila. I should warn you that these characters, while very interesting, belong to a very chaotic period in European history. The 5th century was extremely chaotic, and I would advise you to not start your scenario in this century. The main reasons are:<br />
<br />
-The Visigoths and Ostrogoths founded large kingdoms that were of great importance in their time, but both were gone by the 8th century. They had little lasting effect, so having a Gothic tribe makes little sence when you reach the High Middle ages. The same goes for the Vandals, Sueves and Burgundians.<br />
<br />
-The West Roman Empire officially lasted until 476, when Romulus Augustulus was deposited. This means that there still was a West Roman Empire at the time of Attila. It was in 451 that Attila was defeated at the Catalaunian Fields.<br />
<br />
-Islam didn't appear until the 7th century, and the muslim conquest of Spain started in 711. The Caliphate of Cordoba (est.929) played a very important role in Europe, and personally I would have made Moorish Spain a civilization. Cordoba was the second largest city in Europe after Constantinople, and it was a great center of learning. The Moors were in Spain from 711 to 1492, which is almost your entire timespan. In fact Moorish Spain would be the most technically advanced civilization in Europe for a long time.<br />
<br />
-If you have the HRE as a civ, remember that this concept was born in 800 with the coronation of Charlemagne as Emperor. Then the division of the Frankish Empire in 843 (Treaty of Verdun) lay the foundation for the mainly German HRE (which in Norwegian is called &quot;Det tysk-romerske rike&quot;). Having a &quot;Holy Romans&quot; tribe in the 5th and 6th centuries doesn't really make much sense... and it wasn't until Otto I was elected in 932, and later crowned emperor in Rome in 962, that it was the Eastern part that became the &quot;Holy Roman Empire&quot;.<br />
<br />
-You seem to know a lot about the later period, and I think it would be a good idea to focus on that. It would be extremely hard to maintain historical accuracy in a scenario stretching over more than 1000 years.<br />

-Well, I think the era of the great migrations should be covered in the patch as a whole -with appropriate techs, units, etc. -If just because I think this period is very exciting, and I'd like to make a scen or two about it at some later point, using the patch. -But of course, the main tribes &amp; events won't be presented in the &quot;big&quot; scenario here, other than massive barb attacks and wanderings. -with a few notes on the significant changes and events. <br />
<br />
 ...It would be extremely hard to maintain historical accuracy in a scenario stretching over more than 1000 years.<br />
<br />
-Yes. The basic framework (techs, units etc) will be the most important. I won't preplace other than the uttermost important great cities in the scenario, so the cities players build after this, will be placed quite according to the circumstances.<br />
<br />
What I want to simulate is more in the way of what the original game accomplished. While I will preplace some cities, units, and set up some interesting historical situations (via events etc), so there is a scenario to get involved in, the most important thing will be the right &quot;medieval feel&quot; of development, game pace and excitement, as one's tribe expands into the unknown, becomes more advanced, builds &amp; conquers new cities, improve government, set up trade routes etc, much in the vain of the original game, just in medieval terms. -So players will face the same challenges that medieval nations met, and have to make appropriate choices.<br />
<br />
I am aware that the concept of &quot;The Holy Roman Empire&quot; changes somewhat during those 1000 years. Do you have any suggestions as to how to simulate this? -The more broadly applicable the better!<br />
<br />
-Moorish Spain will be represented under &quot;The Infidels&quot;, which will broadly cover all the various arab tribes/empires during this time. One will be able to set up more detailed scens, using the patch, focusing on the more specific situations, using other tribes. But I think this broad &quot;hat&quot; fits the the ongoing medieval theme quite nicely. The european powers attempt to defend all of western christendom against the threat of the (technically &amp; culturally) superior, but non-christian arab empires!<br />

Sounds like an excellent idea! While I have enjoyed many war-scenarios, I have always preferred empire-building.

<br />
I'm not quite sure. I've been thinking about that myself. During the entire Middle Ages I would say the two most powerful figures were the Pope in Rome and the emperor. Or actually the emperors - as there was an eastern (Byzantine) and a western (Holy Roman) emperor.<br />
<br />
One way to simulate the Pope might be as a pre-built wonder in Rome. That would make Rome an important city, which it should be. But how do you simulate the influence the Papacy has on the Catholic people of all nations?<br />
<br />
I tried to come up with some ideas about the HRE and the emperor, but I think I need to think about it some more. <br />

<br />
If you should have a Danish tribe will it include Norway? Because when your scenario starts Norway isn't included in the Danish kingdom. Will the conquest of Norway and Iceland (if Iceland is included in your map) be an objective? <br />
Personaly I think it would be more interesting with a Danish tribe instead of an united scandinavian. Because if you're the Danish you can unite Scandinavia and then try to conquer Finland, Estionia and Kurland like the Scandinavians tried irl. Also there is Danelaw to fight for.<br />
<br />
Otherwise I think that this should be a great MOD-pack and I'm looking forward to play the scenario. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

Ptolemy, you should definitely check it out this weekend! -Det foregår ude på Engen i Fruens Bøge og slutter på søndag! -And the best part is all those lovely, adorable, pretty, amazingly beautiful women out there, all dressed medieval style... OH! -I need more!<br />

I got involved with making another scenario, &quot;The Emin Pasha Relief Expedition&quot; -which is a quite different events/quest based scenario on another of my favourite subjects : AFRICA (check out the other thread), and I expect this scen to be done in a few weeks, perhaps more, accounting for playability issues which may arise...<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I haven't been doing so much research on this one, because I've been reading so much about African expeditions and making African graphics. But I'll get into this again, as soon as I go back to medieval subjects in the autumn.<br />
<br />
My african adventure gives me the opportunity to experiment with events, which I think will be useful when it comes to building this.<br />

So it's all Africa for two months for me. :) And the occasional Civ3 thing... at least for the moment. But when all the fuzz wears off, I'll pick up on this project again. I'll still have this database of ideas to go back to. Whether it'll be for civ2 or civ3 depends on the editing tools Firaxis provides for civ3. As it looks now, Civ2 is most likely, since I'll need all the scripting tools I can get. Civ3 sure shows some interesting possibilities, but they need some heavily expanding, before applicable in a scenario.<br />

Anyway, it seems &quot;a couple of weeks&quot; quite easily turns into &quot;a couple of months&quot; ;) But civ2 is far from dead, especially if the patches for civ3 does not come shortly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can answer this!<br />
<br />
The first Europeon castles go back as far as the 9th century and were built on natural (sometimes artificial) mounds. Most had CURCULAR wooden walls and moats. These castles were small and only had the bare nessecities (A small keep, a ROUND wood or stone tower, and buildings for the castle retainers).<br />
<br />
Starting in the 12th century the castles became influenced by crusaders, and became more SQUARE. The new types of castles were bigger, made of stone, and had more towers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Erm, probably yes. I'm still getting ideas for this one and I do have the map and graphics [nearly] finished. I'm still not finished with my history project, and it gets 1st priority for the time being. But I have this great database of ideas to return to when I get spare time, so it's not actually dropped. I'm also pretty interested in seeing how the editor for Civ3 develops. It might be better to do it for Civ3. Still pondering... :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">Apr 22, 2002, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I must be a crazy man. I have final exams in about a month and got two written assignments to finish before that. But there you go.<br />
<br />
The rework I've been doing for &quot;Hammer&quot; has taken a turn for a bit more. I am nearing completion of an expanded tech tree that covers the whole span of the time period ca 500-1500 AD, from skinboats to galleons, from spears to cannonballs, from tribal kingdoms to protestantisms.<br />
<br />
The good news is, that the tech tree, always the hardest part for me, is very well underway, and all but a few icons of the graphics work is done (yet not to be underestimated), and I am very satisfied with it. It has been some hard work but its coming to an end. Its a sort of single branch tech tree with some minor branches, that can be cut off or emphasized for specific scenario purposes.<br />
<br />
As for the full-blown scenario part, I may do that at some point, but the most important (and most exciting) thing for me is finishing the &quot;patch&quot; part. It has taken a lot of careful consideration to plan and set up the tech tree alone, which needs to be historically accurate and precise, presenting the player with key historical problems of the middle ages, yet needs to be simplified and iconographically elegant enough to cover such a wide time span. On the other hand, its tremendously exciting work, as the tech tree can hold some pretty dramatic challenges and real rewards for players, when the time span is so wide.<br />
<br />
On the important ;) subject of governments, I've now come to the following conclusion (and this has taken some consideration and re-reading of the previous pages to get to this point), listed in the order they appear in the tech tree (which, apparently, does not differ so much from the standard game... seems Sid got something right when he did it the first time) :<br />
<br />
Tribal Kingdom (despotism) -basically what civs start out with, you all know what its about.<br />
<br />
Monarchy (monarchy) -a developed christian monarchy, with appropriate advantages like liberal unit support, but restrained economy.<br />
<br />
Feudalism (republic) -a sort of contracted monarchy, with some very beneficial economical advantages, but where the king has to ask the nobles (senate) about a lot of things... and faces the occasional rebellion among the citizens, from the misfits of serfdom.<br />
<br />
Empire (communism) -a larger empire with better infrastructure and intelligence/church network, where learned church officials see to that the prince has his way and noble protests are overheard -vet bishops/assassins.<br />
<br />
Holy Empire (democracy) -basically the empire on a good footing with the catholic church, providing increased trade and science output, but threatened by frequent peasant revolts and heretic uprisings (unhappiness problems). -building the avignon papacy (UN) following the great schism will allow warfare under the guise of crusading missions...<br />
<br />
Protestantism (fundamentalism) -history has proven the protestant monarchies superior in terms of technological and economical prosperity and progress, but this was not so sure when protestantism first challenged the catholic order of Europe... this government appears very late, and is restraining for science, but liberating for unhappiness and military defences against the catholic powers, giving the small nations in the north a chance to challenge the catholic empires in the south. -which is nicely quite historically appropriate.<br />
<br />
Gonna post some screenshots in a couple of days. ;)<br />

<br />
By the way, Xeven, I think you've got it wrong. Its the other way around. Castles and towers became increasingly more circular in shape (inspired by middle eastern architecture), since circular walls and towers are more resilient to siege bombardments than square ones. -its true, that fortresses and fortifications were built along circular models etc earlier (including the viking ones) which probably implies an early influence from the middle east.</div></div><hr />

This might be in the thread somewhere but:<br />
Is this patch going to be playable as a modpack?<br />
IE will I be able to launch a game of it on that big european map that we both have with random civs (at preset starting locations of course).<br />
In that case, which civs will be in the list?<br />
Will the custom titles be used to their full extent? (that is: the german kingdoms (Im guessing there will be many in a modpack variant) has german titles, the french ones have french titles, etc, etc)<br />
<br />
I'm very glad to see some progress here again :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

I've struggled very hard to set up the tech tree in a reasonable way, that allows one to start up one branch, or from the very beginning, so you'll be able to play as a modpack essentially. I haven't completely decided on each and every available tribe, (there som pretty extensive lists earlier in the thread). For specific scenario purposes, some branches can be extended, cut off, or made dependant on events.<br />
<br />
One thing, though, I have deliberately emphasized european developments in the tech tree, so arab technologies are incorporated as they influenced european developments, not as an independent arab/middle eastern branch. There are no such thing as civspecific branches, precisely because I want it to run smoothly as a modpack. I'm gonna leave some extensive documentation for the tech tree that will make it easier to change bits for scenarios (including my own)...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">Jul 31, 2002, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Difference is, one can use this patch to make scenarios. Because I find it so ridiculously hard to design a scenario, I wanted to make a patch which I could use with minimal changes for my medieval scenarios. So basically its an exchange of the original files, rules, texts and graphics. Additionally I wanted it to be playable like a modpack, so a lot of thought went into the attempt that one can use the patch at all the levels of the tech tree, and with relative ease create medieval scenarios from it. Not everyone will likely use all of this together, but other scen creators can take the nitbits they like, graphics/mechanics wise, and use them how they see fit. The screenshots are just showoffs from some scenarios I've been testing the patch with.<br />

&quot;Acts like a theatre in every city&quot; strikes me as very appropriate ;) -There are a lot of built-in jokes like that... Also, my reasoning is that since holy empires are representations of the great catholic powers of later medieval times (think Spain, France), the inquisition comes along as a wonder that can tame some of the unhappiness problems stemming from increased unhappiness and the cancellation of the great happiness wonders<br />
with Heresy and Peasant Revolt among other factors. (this part of the tree is constructed to give an idea of the uprisings and crises of the late middle ages (and different ways of solving these problems -switching to protestantism will solve all happiness problems, and some financial problems (by the acquisition of church holdings) -but banking, fine arts, colonialism and better trade are another ways to solve some of these problems)<br />
I think banking appeared much later<br />
If banking is basically systems of credit and financing, it was increasingly high business in the 14th/15th centuries, playing a large part in big mercantile ventures and big politics in financing wars etc. -originating with the north italian city trade republics/oligarchies, and the dutch merchant states.<br />

I suggest &quot;bellows&quot; instead of &quot;blast furnace&quot;, a 19th century invention.<br />
According to my sources, the blast furnace was introduced in the 14th century, a key metallurgical step for large-scale production of iron (cast iron), used in combination with 'blooming' in the production of armor, and in the development and manufacture of cannon and shot. So I considered it reasonable as a key preq for large scale production of cannon etc. (the first use of cannon appears as early as 1346, IIRC).<br />
<br />
Along with the huge demands for metal in armoury and coinage in the 14th/15th century, it contributed to a boom in european mining technologies which made possible further advances in metallurgy.<br />
<br />
Here's a quick reference :<br />
http://scholar.chem.nyu.edu/~tekpages/ironworking.html<br />
<br />
I think the powering of bellows etc. is accounted for in the advantage of the waterwheel improvement.<br />
<br />
However, maybe I should use the blast furnace as a preq for gunnery/firearms instead, and introduce the bombard earlier?</div></div><hr />

So far everything works fine, tho there's a lot of adjusting to do in the unit/terrain-parameters department, to make the game as challenging and exciting as I'd like it to be. Terrain was imperative in medieval warfare, and so it should be here. Which basically means very slight differences in unit types can make the difference in war<br />
<br />
I also discovered I had a handful of techs left over, so I'm thinking, what the hell, I'll extend the tree a bit further into modern times, introducing the frigate, musket cavalry etc. Already I'm leaving the userdefinable tech slots open for use in events, so there's plenty of room. And I still got a handful of slots left in the units file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winterfritz</div><div class="date">Aug 12, 2002, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would actually recommend that you leave the tech tree finishing where it does now.  This is, after all, a medieval mod, so I think it makes the best sense that the most modern stuff you can get is at the very end of the middle ages, the sixteenth century.<br />
<br />
For extra units, I think non-buildable horse archers in the slots used for barb uprisings use could work nicely to simulate the constant nomad incursions of the middle ages.  If you do decide to end the scenario in the sixteenth century, adding pikemen and hussars would nicely round off the final, 'modern' units set.<br />

One of my key ambitions is that I'd like to get barbarian activity and sounds to blend in with the changes of the game. I tried to do that in the tech tree, and included exclusive barbarian units in my units file, but much yet to be done. (note, some units have not even received stats yet in the rules.txt, because I haven't gotten around to them yet).<br />
<br />
I will probably have to do a few key changes to the tech tree along the way too. Some things feel a little too slow, and others a little way too flexible. AI players shouldn't get too much leeway by trading a lot of techs too early, so it probably has to be tightened up a bit.<br />

<br />
Taking a brief pause from it these days, some real life to attend to. Got a new semester coming up, which is gonna be extremely busy.<br />
<br />
Putting together my own course in medieval history these days, which is gonna lay the foundation for my thesis, when the time comes. I plan to do a pioneer research project about the unique linking in european thought between spirituality and rationality, which laid the foundation for the concepts that made possible european technological development and industrialization, as well as the conquest, empire, and domination of other cultures in modern times, and the legitimacy/rightfulness of such. Not many such cross-period studies exist, since historians have traditionally made a sharp divide between medieval times and the modern world. So, not much research has been dedicated to examining the foundation of many such european concepts, that may be problematic even in our times, but developed during the middle ages. Religious conversion, the question of the 'infidels', 'just war', and even simply the rationale that God or faith can be explained rationally, giving birth to the modern sciences and industrialization.<br />
<br />
I think its gonna be one blast of a study. Just wanted to share it with you ;) Anyway, it raises a lot of questions, lots of which I have dealt with in the research I've been doing for this civ2 project. I realize there's much difference to history as a research object, and in civ2 terms, where the basic element is that it has to be fun. But I do have an ambition about making an attempt at putting some sense into it, some things that actually explain the changes taking place during the middle ages and early modern times. And I guess I'm not completely finished thinking the groundwork through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winterfritz</div><div class="date">Aug 16, 2002, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Morten; I only just got back from a 3 day school camp.  However, I did manage to get in about half a day of solid play just before I left :D<br />
<br />
Firstly, I'm enjoying it tremendously.  I hadn't played just a straight game of civ (ie not a scen) for ages, so it was great to rediscover how much fun the game is at base.  But of course your techs/graphics/units etc are all way better than the originals, and also far more fun simply because they are fresh and different.  Its like learning to play a whole new game; brings back memories of those heady days when I was first learning the intricacies of civ2 ;)<br />
<br />
Here are the few (very few) flaws/irritating things I have come across.<br />
-  Hills and forest have their usual positions reversed in this mod.  I suggest you change them back, so that its easier for people to adapt their own maps to it.<br />
-  The abbey terrain is a nice idea, but I'm not sure if thats the best possible use of that slot.  In particular, I thought your terrain set could have done with some desert - perhaps replacing the arctic terrain (probably only included in the first place because of your Viking bias :p ;) )<br />
-  I'd love some stats for the siege units and the raiders and berserkers, especially the raiders as one is always getting those from huts and barbs continually spawn them.<br />
-  You should check if theres a way to change the game so that a random game starts from ~500 AD and ends in ~1600, as it was a bit confusing playing with knights and chevaliers in 350 BC or 1842 AD.<br />
<br />
I like your map, btw; great atmosphere and kinda looks like the maps they made in those days too :b:  Apart from its (very few) flaws, this is a hugely fun patch and I'm off to play it more now ;)  More comments will be coming.</div></div><hr />

yeah... you're probably right... the reason I wanted to swap them, was because I wanted rebels to hide in the forests instead of the hills, but its true, it gives a lot of trouble when using ones other maps... which one ought to be able to, with a minimum of fuss. (Although its not very difficult to exchange one type of terrain with another using MapEdit and PSP, very few people probably has the patience for that) -so I guess I'll leave it standard in the patch, and unique to my own scenarios.<br />

Another concept that I might want to make unique to the hammer scenario. Its a particularly rich terrain, but since the AI doesn't really build new ones (players can transform wilderness terrains to abbeys, with monks), I'm not sure if it makes enough sense at it is. Also, I might want to move the engineers from the monk concept to some type of military engineer available with engineering.<br />

<br />
There's a new rules.txt attached which has preliminary stats for those units. The siege towers, however, are intended to be defensive only, like a portable fortress of some sorts hiding other units. Not sure if it works as intended yet, tho.<br />
<br />
The timeline will the be the last thing to change. I think I'll include a medievalized standard map of Europe with the patch, with all the correct starting positions for tribes (note I haven't selected which ones to include yet), then set the timeline, and save as scenario. I could then include a couple of different scenarios, one starting raw off in the dark ages, another with later tribes and more preplaced cities and techs, and lastly a latemedieval scen. The scens would be pretty rough, since I'd still like to give people the choice to play freely, but it'll give a good idea of how one can use the concepts (playing, and in using parts for ones own scens)<br />

Thanx :) Its really good to get some feedback on this. Its true, there's a lot of viking bias in this, since northern european history was my focal point along the way (as opposed to a mediterrenean pov). But I might want to keep some of the concepts unique to my viking scenario, and make the patch a bit more generic (but still keep the angle and attitude) -also, when I get around to altering the text messages, a lot of things will make more sense. Like the crusades starting of with Phi giving an extra advance etc (supposed to pop up a message about Pope Urbans Message delivered in the town of xxxx... all christians must join in the crusades etc...) -There are other such texts that want changing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have had one game of this mod though and I must say I mostly agree with Jan (this mod is great work :goodjob: ), though I really do wish there was a city.txt so that all AI cities wouldn't be named &quot; &quot; :(<br />
<br />
Also the bishops seems to lack a real role in the game (I thought they would be diplo units).<br />
<br />
I also think you should even out the stats some more, an &quot;attack&quot; unit allways loses on defence, etc as it is now.<br />
<br />
I think you should contemplate moving the templars to another unit slot, as I was able to get them very early in the game via huts.<br />
<br />
Oh and the save file you talked about in your mail wasnt included in the actual zip.<br />
<br />
I was a little dissapointed that I couldn't build any &quot;Hammer&quot; units even after building Blood sacrifices (though I only half expected to be able to do so). ;)<br />
<br />
(thats AI land on the screen, the cities with names are the ones founded by me, playing as the Danes)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winterfritz</div><div class="date">Aug 16, 2002, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've actually been using a city.txt I've cobbled together from various sources.  For most civs its little more than a collection of names from my historical atlases, so don't expect too much accuracy, but it does fill those name fields for the AI with reasonably correct sounding stuff.<br />
<br />
I'm slowly filling up the civ slots too.  At the moment I have:<br />
English<br />
French<br />
Germans<br />
Danes<br />
Norsemen<br />
Lombards<br />
Poles<br />
Magyars<br />
Italians (ie the Kingdom of Italy, Papal states and Kingdom of Sicily)<br />
Spaniards (perhaps split these into Castilians, Aragonese, etc)<br />
Scots<br />
<br />
(I've only been modifying the civs/names for my own games, and as such that list is only my advice for what you could include, Morten.)<br />
<br />
I've attached that city.txt file for you, Henrik.  We gotta play some MP of this too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">Aug 19, 2002, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys :) I simply used the city.txt from my hammer scenario, but haven't really gotten around to changing most of the txt-files. I'd like the in game messages to 'fit' neatly to the various events of the game.<br />
<br />
In addition to the points you raised, here's my own preliminary list of changes to be done next :<br />
<br />
* Map Making (Map) not necessary to exchange maps? -seems players can exchange maps without the Map advance... which basically means I need to make a few changes in the tech tree.<br />
* tech tree tightened up (especially in the beginning), research rate is ok I think<br />
* happiness tightened up. happiness improvements should be needed. -done. -global variable set to 8, which makes first happiness problems appear at Diety when cities reach size 3.<br />
* a little more lax resource production, expansion easier, growth better in good terrain. Marketplaces needed for cities &gt; 6<br />
* Settlers a little cheaper -monks used only in Hammer scenario -Military engineers available with Engineering. Anyone got a cool unit icon for this one?<br />
* unit succession cleaner, max 5-8 units available at a time, especially ships<br />
* viking raiders upgrade to heretics or similar... drakkars and knarrs obsolete with carracks or similar<br />
* wonders a little cheaper and more urgently needed/harder to get (tree tightened up)<br />
* road multiplier considered up = move 6 for horse units, ships changed accordingly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Winterfritz</div><div class="date">Aug 19, 2002, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those all sound very good, esp. the higher level of unhappiness.  I just remembered I played all my games on deity and yet didn't get unhappy citizens till cities reached about size 7 or higher.<br />
<br />
I will miss the monks though, I thought they went very well in the mod (although settlers probably should be cheaper).  Perhaps just move the monks higher up the tech tree, to go with the papal reform techs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">Aug 19, 2002, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes... changing the happiness makes quite an impact on the game, since the churches and cathedrals are among the most expensive improvements in upkeep. (brothels are cheaper but cause more rats to appear (pollution)). So it makes trade urgent. <br />
<br />
By this time, the fundamental phase of expansion should have been made, so there is enough cities to trade with, and roads to be built, sea routes discovered etc. And proper wars to be fought, rather than the small skirmishes of the early game. If, say settlers are as cheap as 2 rounds of production (half price), I think that will help a little on the dynamics of the game.<br />
<br />
I'll still use the monks and abbeys for my hammer scenario, where I can limit off parts of the tech tree for the specific tribes (i.e. the concept being that viking tribes remain comparatively primitive but militarily powerful, until they decide to trade techs with the christian empires, which basically makes viking weaponry go obsolete). But for this patch, they don't work very well. They are supposed to represent something like the great benedictine expansion of the early middle ages, but are simply too powerful too early. Engineers will make more sense, since they will primarily be useful in constructing roads and fortresses in siege situations etc. in the later game.<br />
<br />
BTW, how well do you think the AI is in defending its cities without city walls being available until halfway up the tree? -I noticed its very good at building the fortresses (as usual), but I didn't see it use them really for anything purposeful. Instead I was able to position my units in their fortresses without any fighting. Did any of you stage some organized fighting?<br />
<br />
During one of my games, I was able to conquer a couple of AI cities, but it was a bit of a lucky punch (getting chevaliers from a hut), and I wasn't able to keep them, when they stroke back.</div></div><hr />

It's an error in my tech tree. I need to put Roc (rocketry) in before Pagan Cult in the tree; only tribes that have both advances, and Blood Sacrifices have been built, can produce hammers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jonicro</div><div class="date">Feb 06, 2003, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:lol: <br />
<br />
Quite a coincidence, have just been playing around with a thought of similar mod in the past week. Anything new on the status of this project?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">Feb 06, 2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm.... the status is pretty unclear.... I sort of gave up presenting this as a generic patch, though reading up on the comments in this thread, it might be fun to do just that. The problem is, I'm such a perfectionist, so I want everything to work out... and don't have much time to do it. -Also I'm a bit doubtful as to how much use this will be to anyone else than myself, scenario creation wise. If nothing else, perhaps, inspiration.<br />
<br />
Instead, I've been playing with using the foundation, i.e. techs and units for a couple of real scenarios, where all this work has really come in handy. I thank god I don't have to do that tech tree again, but can settle with minor tweaks and whistles this time around :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Feb 06, 2003, 11:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We want the GENERIC patch! So we can use it for our own scenarios too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jonicro</div><div class="date">Feb 07, 2003, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think it it's that important to have a generic patch, a non-generic scenario can also be used as a foundation for new scenarios. Like you said people making scenarios based on this project still need to do some tweaks on the rules and graphics. On non-generic project this work is slightly larger but the difference is quite a minor one really. When the files are made solely for your scenario it means less work for you and they fit your scenario better.  <br />
<br />
It seems ill be making a scenario on timeline of the fall of West Roman Empire to the reign of Charlemagne and it really would make the job a lot easier to use this project to base it on. Maybe you could email me a copy of the rough version? :)<br />
