<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir Yelof</div><div class="date">Apr 30, 2002, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nowadays the GOTM is one of the main reasons I play Civ!  I like the idea of a scenario and being able to talk about how it went, and see how other people played the same situation.  It's like duplicate bridge.  Takes out a lot of randomness.  Civ 3 is antisocial playing by yourself, and few people want to read when we brag about what happened in some unusual scenario we once found ourselves in.  But everyone can identify with &quot;oh yeah, and then you found the choke point?&quot; or &quot;how did you get the iron away from so-and-so?&quot; and the like.<br />
<br />
Matrix, any hints on GOTM 7?  Map size, difficulty level, anything unusual?<br />

Since the last two games have been on a small and large map (respectively), I would predict a standard sized map for the next one. Difficulty could be anything, though a return to higher difficulty (Monarch or Emperor) seems likely. <br />
<br />
It's largely a moot point as the game comes out in two days anyway. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fossil</div><div class="date">Apr 30, 2002, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started a bunch of games as the Iroquois over the weekend with the new patch, playing through the BC's to get a feel for the new patch and playing this Civ.<br />
<br />
Some comments:<br />
<br />
Map generation <br />
<br />
Overall, the maps overall seemed nicer to play than previous versions.  I tried the worst possible world settings. With one exception, no setting gave me a starting position as bad as GOTM5.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dry&quot; and &quot;Hot&quot; gets you a lot of desert, sure, but there were rivers with floodplains adjacent to desert areas, and also more grassland than I expected.<br />
<br />
3 billion year old world gave some areas of the map that were totally uninhabitable, but the starting positions of all Civs were actually quite productive.<br />
<br />
&quot;Cold&quot; did not seem to have the really extended areas of tundra that it did previously.<br />
<br />
The one exception - a tiny, dry, 3 billion year old world with minimum archipelago land mass.  That was ugly.  The starting position was an island with room for two cities, max.  Tiles were mostly mountain and plains (no water source).  Only one tile capable of generating 2 food on the island.<br />
<br />
Worst map for Iroquois: archipelago with small land mass - This reduces the value of expansionist trait to almost zero; the small land mass tends to result in small cities, which reduces the need for temples.<br />
<br />
Best map for Iroquois: Pangaea with max land mass<br />
<br />
Raging hordes?<br />
<br />
If the barbarian setting is at raging hordes, better build some spearmen quick. 'Nuff said.<br />
<br />
Building a central core<br />
<br />
Corruption seems slightly reduced, so your core area can be slightly more expansive -  the pressure to build a whole bunch of cities almost on top of your capital has been reduced slightly.<br />
<br />
If we're neighbors, let's be friends <br />
<br />
If we have a culturally linked start, your neighbors will be the Aztecs and the Americans.  The Jaguar Warriors seemed to outperform their stats in battle.<br />
<br />
Golden Age <br />
<br />
The mounted warrior is a very cool UU.  However, if you fast-track your research to horseback riding and start fighting with them, you will have a golden age that is too early to do you much good.<br />
<br />
Get your war paint on! <br />
<br />
Thumbs up, ready to rock! [dance]</div></div><hr />

<br />
No joke! I have lost 5 Persian Immortals to 3 Jaguar Warriors. 6 casualties total.<br />
Jag attacks Immortal on hill across river. Takes 1 dmg.<br />
Imm attacks jag, not across river, not on hill or mountain. Loses utterly.<br />
Imm attacks aztec HORSEMAN in a mountain across a river, win without a scratch.<br />
<br />
Did someone fix those aztec warriors to 4-6-2 or so? Riflemen for jags?</div></div><hr />
