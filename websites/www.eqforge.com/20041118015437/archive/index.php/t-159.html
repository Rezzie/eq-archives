Actually, I think it is the other way around. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif I was told that they took the sounds from Civ and used them for the film....but, I could be mistaken.  That movie is a riot! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/lol.gif<br />

<br />
I've experienced a lot of this. In the game &quot;Axis and Allies&quot;, in the movie where it shows the buy in the bomber, it has the same sound has &quot;3d Movie Maker&quot; and a lot of other games.<br />
<br />
There is also &quot;universal&quot; animations.<br />
Eg: http://www.maxpages.com/ponytafire8 <br />
Check the flame on the cursor.<br />
They used this in practically every game I have! It's been either edited or rendered, but it's always the same flame!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can you also figure out who did the defeat music?<br />
At first, I thought the little sad song played when you lose was composed by the Microprose team but several days ago I heard on the radio that music. It was the 3rd symphony of somebody, the speaker said. But who?<br />

Dearly departed,<br />
<br />
We are gathered here today to celebrate the passing of a great leader. Though we have only know Cimfindriel for a week and a half his presence will remain within our hearts. To some he was a friend, but to most he was an aspiration; a constant reminder of how we could all become better people, and more importantly, better Civ players.  We will miss Cimfindriel dearly...may his soul find everlasting peace and eternal rest. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/lol.gif<br />

<br />
I will claim ignorance as a defense in this case.  I didn't know when it came out, just told by a friend that the sound from the movie was from the game.  Chances are...I just heard the wrong thing.  So, guess I talked before I thought http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
