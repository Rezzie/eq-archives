<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2002, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Judging by the GOTM Spoiler threads, there are only a handful of people who have the time to finish a game in a week or less.  The maps would have to be tiny/small for people to be able to finish, and that would mean the GOTW would end up being somewhat repetitive.  I usually finish the GOTM's quite early and wish there were more games to compete in.  With the limited number of people who could participate it just wouldn't be as fun though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldasar</div><div class="date">Mar 15, 2002, 05:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GREAT!!!  3 15.79% <br />
Good Idea  3 15.79% <br />
Dunno  1 5.26% <br />
Naaah  6 31.58% <br />
BAD idea  6 31.58% <br />
<br />
With this i will NOT go further with the idea!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ButSam80</div><div class="date">Mar 18, 2002, 02:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GREAT idea, but no larger than a Standard map...even Standard may be a bit large. Or perhaps 2 games per month would be better--one due on the 15th, and the other on the last day of the month. Also, I would hope you would go no higher than Emperor difficulty except maybe once or twice every 6 months, and have the average difficulty be Monarch. Just my input!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldasar</div><div class="date">Mar 18, 2002, 04:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will see what i can do.. But it won`t be this month at least.. To much school and stuff. :crazyeye:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ButSam80</div><div class="date">Mar 18, 2002, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I TOTALLY understand; I'm about ready to die also. But if you need some help starting in mid-July, I will be available to help out! I'm no civ EXPERT, but I am not a total beginner either. Before then, though, I have the rest of this semester to survive, then an ROTC training camp (hoorah Air Force!), then I'm getting married (YAYYYYYYY!!!), but I want to volunteer to help out starting in mid-July!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldasar</div><div class="date">Mar 19, 2002, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gongrats Sam... :) Hope it will be a long and marry one..  I will tell you if i need help and when to start. But i think mid-july looks nice. I added u to the buddylist so i will talk to you soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ButSam80</div><div class="date">Mar 19, 2002, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks much! Just a warning as well, I probably will be hard to get a hold of until mid-July...it's the second half of a killer semester, then we're visiting the soon-to-be-inlaws, then I have a month of Air Force training where I won't have any e-mail access, then the wedding, so if you don't hear from me for a long time, know that I still am interested!<br />
<br />
I think it would be best to make it be 2 games per month, one due on the 15th and the other on the last day of the month, so it opens it up to more people, and yet still is twice as fast as we currently have. This also means we can occasionally do Large/Huge maps for those really dedicated Civ3 fans, so we don't limit ourselves on map size.<br />
<br />
I look forward to getting this going in July! Any further suggestions you have and all? What exactly would you need the most help with? I would be willing to learn how to design maps and place resources, etc. to make things very interesting!<br />
<br />
Sam</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldasar</div><div class="date">Mar 20, 2002, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok.. That`s ok..

Thank you. We'll see the GOTW coming when it's ready.<br />
<br />
By the way, how are you planning to keep up a game every week if you even don't have the time now until may? Also, my estimation would be that the number of participants will be between 3 and 15. Just so you know. :)</div></div><hr />
