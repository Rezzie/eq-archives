Vote for one of each option: A, B etc.<br />

We'll vote on tweaking the map size later.<br />

Majority vote rules.<br />
<br />
Agreed?</div></div><hr />

Majority vote rules.<br />
<br />
Agreed? Not to be too picky, but am I safe in assuming that the choice receiving a plurality (most votes) will be deemed the winner and that a majority (&gt; 50%) will not be required?  Or will we possibly need runoff elections for the top 2 vote getters if one does not reach a majority?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Feb 20, 2003, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also voted for all Random. IMO, it gives it a sense of a mystery and a supprise :).</div></div><hr />

It's just that mountains can't be used for anything (unless special) and they take thousands of years to get rid of. (at least in the beginning:) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elsaak</div><div class="date">Feb 20, 2003, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">agree for the B &amp; C mystery<br />
IMHO Archipegalo gives a little more interest <br />
4 billion is average between mountains and all grassland...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kev</div><div class="date">Feb 20, 2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As with poll #1, Perhaps deciding on player restrictions first would be better before deciding on the map.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind as well that we could have an impartial 3rd party (as we had Smash do) create a custom map for us.  We can give ourselves extra challenges or very interesting setups with this method (start on a small island far away from anything, no huts, specific accelerated startup, etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Feb 20, 2003, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The age of the map does not really affect whether the terrain is mountains or grasslands, but how 'grouped' the terrain is.  The older the age the more spread out things are.  The newer the more grouped they are.<br />
<br />
So you may get a mountain range that is 10 squares big in a 3 billion map, but it may only be a 4 square mountain range in a 5 billion game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talar</div><div class="date">Feb 20, 2003, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All random here as well. I think only the land form makes any real big impact on the game and I don't have any special preferences there anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Feb 21, 2003, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I choose 5 billion age (thinking there'd be more mountains), large land mass and continents to get more AI contact (we were quite isolated last time, and barely threatened by the AI), and random everything else.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andu Indorin</div><div class="date">Feb 27, 2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Voted random on all except for age.  Voted 3 million on that since that options tends to cluster terrain into more &quot;earth-like&quot; conditions (i.e., mountain ranges rather than isolated peaks; large forests versus scattered forests; etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JAILEM</div><div class="date">Feb 28, 2003, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also went RANDOM all the way.  This will require strategy to be devloped as exploration progresses. Example would be what do we need 1st, horses or boats?</div></div><hr />
