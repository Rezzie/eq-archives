Shame because in large parts of the game so much of the basic worker actions soon become monotonous and rote. <br />
Why not have an order list or priority list for automating? There you could:<br />
<br />
-Group workers.<br />
-Assign them at last to that mindless task of clearing pollution.<br />
-Have them perform successive actions like planting and cutting forests on virgin tiles.<br />
-Drag and draw a road/railroad between cities that they'll build.<br />
-Assign them to certain cities/ borders.<br />
-Weight shield/food production through emphasis of building mines/irrigation.<br />
-Keep track of all automated workers. (Don’t you think they deserve names?)<br />
-Set broad turn lengths for task lists and for simply being automated.<br />
Any more?<br />
I'm sure implementing this shouldn’t detract or become overly complex- <br />
Perhaps it could be similar to the city governors table.</div></div><hr />

You can move all workers in a tile at once, which is just as good, IMO.<br />
-Assign them at last to that mindless task of clearing pollution.<br />
There should be a pollution automation, I agree.  They already have irrigation automation, mine, etc., but no pollution?!<br />
-Have them perform successive actions like planting and cutting forests on virgin tiles.[QUOTE]<br />
Yeah, but a build queue might make save files large and make them long to load.  If not, then this would be a good idea.<br />
[QUOTE]-Drag and draw a road/railroad between cities that they'll build.<br />
We already have a &quot;BUILD ROAD TO...&quot; automation, where you can click on any square and the worker will move there.  But if you're talking about a specifically crooked road, then the build queue answer should be implimented...if it does not add to load time.<br />
-Assign them to certain cities/ borders.<br />
You can already do that.<br />
-Weight shield/food production through emphasis of building mines/irrigation.<br />
Yeah, but AI isn't always too smart...they might slip up.  They already have a &quot;build growth&quot; and &quot;build production&quot; automation.<br />
-Keep track of all automated workers. (Don’t you think they deserve names?)<br />
You can already rename units.<br />
-Set broad turn lengths for task lists and for simply being automated.<br />
Build queue...as I said, I would like to see it implemented, but it might increase load time to load up the queues of every single worker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But this load time seems a problem. Makes me wonder what minimum processor speed Civ IV might require if its going to be up to squeezing in some of the great and crazy ideas this forums rapidly notching up.<br />
<br />
But by 'group workers' I really meant in terms of performing different successive task lists outside of whatever starting tile each one may be on. Say you took ten free workers randomly placed in your territory (You could even choose available workers from a sub menu and not just from the main terrain screen) and added them to an instruction list telling them all to clear pollution for roughly fifty turns then to clear specific jungle (drag a box over wherever) for another fifty, the group would merrily spilt up and set up about their respective duties finishing around the 100 turn mark. give or take a few. ready for more more of that tireless labour thrown their way. <br />
<br />
Hmm it's beginning to sound complicated. Then there's those load times.</div></div><hr />

i wouldnt use anyother auto-workerfunction but would be nice to have this opportuinty</div></div><hr />

Roads add commerce to squares, so having your workers build roads all the time would be wonderous for science...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Verowin</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2004, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What would be a good idea, is to give a worker a series of instructions:<br />
First build a road from A to B, than irrigate this tile, than build a mine there, etc.<br />
Maybe 10 actions maximum? <br />
Another option would be:<br />
In a seperate screen you can set your goals for all your workers:<br />
For example:<br />
priority 1: Irregate<br />
2: mine:<br />
3: road<br />
4: chop wood<br />
etc</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with the &quot;Clear Pollution&quot; automation is that the computer never assigns more than two Workers to any one square -- which means that a non-Industrious civ, before discovering Replaceable Parts, still needs six turns to clear pollution when automated -- not efficient enough by a long shot!</div></div><hr />

I know about build trade, I have Conquests.</div></div><hr />
