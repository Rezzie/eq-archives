<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">May 18, 2002, 02:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How's this for a proposal:<br />
<br />
Every couple of months, the top ten or twenty players in the GOTM rankings play a GOTM against the top five from Apolyton.<br />
<br />
It could be played as a game where the players write-up what their moves etc are, and the rest of us could &quot;watch&quot; from the sidelines.  We would obviously need some form honour system to stop the players reading about each others moves.  Perhaps the players have a tighter schedule to work (say two weeks) and they postpone the write-up so that it lags the actual game by quite a period.  If the top players can't make the time for it, then the next players can step in.<br />
<br />
This idea needs development, but the aim is to 1.) make it a &quot;spectator&quot; type event, and 2.) give players more incentive to try and get into the top 20.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We would also need to have discussions on each players methods. I am sure I would be a much better armchair CIVver than I am a real CIVver.<br />
<br />
The stories could be told in pieces. They could each post what happened in Ancient times. We could then each speculate on the consequences of choices made. Then they could post the results a couple of days later about how things went in the next era, and we could all see how wrong we were.<br />
<br />
Yeah! These top players could be like Lucas...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you talk about the global ranking??<br />
<br />
And I don´t think that the apolyton and the civfanatics rankings can be compared:<br />
- WE don´t reload-<br />
So our best are the best players with wise foresight not the ones with enough time to reload.<br />
<br />
But finally I think that it could be fun to see the games.<br />
As long as the more detailed rules from us are used.</div></div><hr />

NBarclay is number one in the April Apolyton game and finished middle of the pack in GOTM.  I think it is clear who would win.</div></div><hr />

So we ask the top 20 GOTM players to submit detailed spoilers...? <br />
<br />
Many people already do, if you take the time to dig through the spoiler thread carefully.  Also several excellent players have separate threads for their spoilers.  Zachriel has an entire website chronicling his efforts.<br />
<br />
I believe players can learn a tremendous amount from playing and reading about the GOTM.  My game has certainly improved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me as a german it is sometimes very hard to find the right words. So a must is not an option for me...</div></div><hr />

Fair point.  But your english seems pretty good to me.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also apologize if I don´t write enough about my games, also due to lack of time.<br />
But my spoilers are still in all spoiler threads, but I only start posting at the end of the month, so only a few people still read that thread.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

Me too. In the last GOTM, I only played up to 400AD and had to pass my turns until 1500AD when I finally got conquered by someone. Are there some threads with tips where one could learn to play faster without sacrificing too much in micromanagement?</div></div><hr />
