<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">May 22, 2001, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some excellent documents in the downloads section that can really give you a head start. Personally I would (depending on the idea) start with making a good map with the map editor -which could be interesting to play on. Then I would look out for alternate graphics to suit the style of the game, and start building the scenario via the Cheat Menu (and possibly the Events Menu).<br />
<br />
-Also, the RULES.TXT file is the key to editing the scenario rules. The file can be changed with Notepad, as can all the other txt-files. The graphics in the Gif can be changed with an image processor like Paintshop Pro.<br />
<br />
From there on, there's a whole world of opportunities! I really recommend you to check out the docs in the downloads section. There are many good articles, also about getting started.<br />

I have seen reference to event files. Can these be used with any version of Civ2? (I have used them in AoE but did not know they were possible in Civ2.)<br />

<br />
As if you're a mind reader, I did want to make a cool map and add a few custom icons (to replace the ones that really annoy me).<br />
<br />
I'll troll the download section for tips. I'm also interested in corresponding with fellow neophytes (like peterval and thx) about my adventures in building.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/king-tut.gif<br />

<br />
But the best article -and the longest, most comprehensive without doubt- is Leon Marricks &quot;Adv Scenario Making&quot; -check out also Kobayashis pioneer work with experimenting with different unit types -i found that very inspiring.<br />
<br />
Peterval, you can find the downloads section<br />
here :<br />
 http://www.civfanatics.com/civ2downloads.shtml <br />
<br />
Events.txt are only used with the Fantastic Worlds or Multiplayer Gold Editions of Civ2 -or with all versions except the classic version of Civ2.<br />
<br />
If you only have the classic version, you can download a patch to convert it to MGE, and be able to play almost all the scenarios available. -same link as above.<br />
<br />
Glad to be able to help! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
