<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aoxomoxoa</div><div class="date">Feb 14, 2002, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone. First off, let me apologize in advance if I say something out of order here, this is my first post. <br />
<br />
Fist let me preface by saying I'm a brand new Civ addict (I have not ever played any of these types of games since the original SimCity). I picked up Civ3 at the January MacWorld where it was introduced and I've become insanely addicted to it.<br />
<br />
Prior to attempting the GOTM, I've only played at warlord level as I became a little more familiar with the mechanics of the game.<br />
<br />
So my first attempt at the GOTM was so pathetic, that it les to  me to ask some questions, it that's okay....<br />
<br />
1. I have read earlier threads about the 'cheating' of the AI at higher diffiulties. In my game, I built my city immediately upon settling and sent my scout to the NW where the French turned out to be. I set my worker on a road to the wheat square. 10 turns to a pop increase and 10 turns to a warrior. Built the road to wheat, and started on the road to wine in the hills.<br />
Scout has found the French, and sees 2 cities and a settler/warrior has just run by. Around turn 8 I have civil disobedience or disorder in my town from my one freaking citizen. This delays the warrior by 2 more turns. It becomes obvious that I must check the French to the north. I finally get my warrior, and begin a 2nd. <br />
<br />
I start my settler, and meanwhile see the franch build their 4th town, by now slowly moving towards the single square bottleneck. My settler gets built, and sets out with the warrior. I've had my worker building a road in that direction already to speed up that travel. I've set London to building Spearmen by now. When I get to the bottleneck, a French settler/warrior is standing on the single square, I'm one square below them. He builds a city, I build a city. Several turns go by while I build up defense for the 2nd city. Three squares will prevent the french from moving south, Meanwhile my scout has found some techs from goodie huts. I've managed to fortify the two squares on either side of the 2nd city with a warrior and a spearman, the city itself has a warrior and 3 spearman when the French declared war. The first turn, my defenders rebuffed the attack of about 8 warriors with the loss of about 3 total hitpoints. The 2nd turn, the attacking force more than doubled and I was toast.... what didI do wrong? I have no clue. total game was over by about 1000 BC if I remember.<br />
<br />
2nd question...<br />
 I am on a macintosh, and I noticed the appearance of the map was enhanced by symbols marking the productive value of the squares with little icons. Are these a preference? Sure made things a tad easier. Also, the game ran at a much faster pace. The french movements were much faster than the games I've played before....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Feb 14, 2002, 10:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The French probably felt you were blocking their expansion.  It is usually better to use units to do the blocking, rather than cities.  The AI doesn't seem to see the blocking units as obstacles to be removed.  By building your second city in a low food area, that will slow down your expansion in relation to the AI.  They judge your relative power based on how many units/cities you have and how much territory you control.  If they see you as weak, they are much more likely to attack.<br />
<br />
Yes, there is an option in preferences to turn the production/food icons on and off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BillChin</div><div class="date">Feb 14, 2002, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You did several things &quot;wrong.&quot;  On Emperor and Diety difficulty, only one citizen is born happy.  The rest need luxuries or garrison.  So it is imperative to leave that first warrior or even the first two warriors in town.  The second mistake is building your second city far away from the capital.  Experienced players may be able to get away with this, but a novice will usually get crushed if he does this.  If you want to block, the best blocking unit seems to be a scout (if there are no barbarians), a warrior is next best, and a city possibly the worst.<br />
<br />
You are not allowed to restart the GOTM for submission.  However, the February map is a good one for practicing on Emperor level.  I suggest you read my post, &quot;Tips for Emperor Difficulty&quot; and do a replay for fun and learning.  I suggest trying either the Swordsmen Conquest or Horsemen Conquest strategy.  Both are good fits for this map.  I suggest starting the game with a build queue of three warriors then a settler, three more warriors then another settler.  I suggest planting these settlers very close to the capital, one square away on the diagonal or two away on the straight.  Keep enough warriors in your towns to keep the people content.<br />
<br />
With some tips in hand, I am sure that a novice player can defeat the French, though it may take one or more replays.  You will learn a lot more by doing than by just reading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jimtess</div><div class="date">Feb 14, 2002, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, you didn't keep the French happy.  Keep them happy by trading with them.  In high level games focus only like 10% on science near the beginning, and trade your extra $$$ for French techs, also trade your goodie hut techs because at the beginning in Emperor, there is no way (at least I know of) to keep up in science.  If that failed, letting them walk a few warriors around your territory might help them be happier.  Worry about huge stacks though...<br />
<br />
Second, you had no offensive units.  The AI fears offensive units more than defensive it seems.<br />
<br />
Third, you let them attack you.  If you can feel a war coming, attack first.  Ask them to leave, usually if they want war they will declare it during your turn.  It will be a huge advantage to attack them first.<br />
<br />
Hope these helped.</div></div><hr />
