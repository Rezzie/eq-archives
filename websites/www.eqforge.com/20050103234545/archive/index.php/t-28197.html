<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">redtom</div><div class="date">Jul 27, 2002, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I connect or disconnect a blue screen comes up, its happened a few times now. <br />
<br />
Heres the bluescreen infomation I've been bothered to copy down the info on the blue screen it happened when I disconnected with KaZaA on (I don't if thats the problem but it has only happened when that program was on. <br />
<br />
Anyway, heres the bluescreen info:<br />
<br />
&quot;An exception has occured at 0028:C2A57296 in VxD Tcpip (01) + 0002D796. This was called from 0028:CIC37D21 in VxD PPPMac (04) + 000057A1. It maybe possible to continue normally.&quot;<br />
<br />
So I pressed &quot;Enter&quot;<br />
<br />
And another blue screen came up:<br />
<br />
&quot;File Name: tcpip (01) + 0002B8C2 Error: OE: 0028: C2A553C2&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, it continued but it did unearth me considering the damage a virus, that is now gone, had done to my computer.<br />
The virus &quot;Winchi95&quot; caused the computer people to replace the 2 CD drives twice, the memory once and otherthings.<br />
<br />
Could it be due to the damage caused by the now gone virus or could it be KaZaA?<br />
<br />
Pls, pls help<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />
Ps. I have just noticed a strange thing about the above files, today, ie, when the problem happened, was the first time they were accessed</div></div><hr />

Do you have the latest version? I do and it happens not so much now. Kazaa is an unstable thing, prone to crashes and freezes.</div></div><hr />
