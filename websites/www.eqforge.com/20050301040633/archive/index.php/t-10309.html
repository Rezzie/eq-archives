<br />
Hey guys. I wanted to drop you a line about the upcoming patch. We've sent it off to testing and baring any unforeseen problems it should be available some time next week. That is not a promise that it WILL be available next week however, since any number of things can cause a reset. We're on v1.14f right now, it being the 7th patch we've submitted to testing, only to find showstoppers. <br />
<br />
Just keeping you in the loop. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jim1013</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another thing which i think is a bug is the following:<br />
<br />
I Captured all the English cities, however they had a settler, so their settler &amp; all their units were still alive.  They went and built a city in their turn.<br />
<br />
Now as you'd all know (and i hate this part) an enemies capital ALWAYS moves to another city when you capture it.. I preferred the Civ2 model. - it escapes if it can, but thats beside the point.<br />
<br />
Since they lost all their citie, and built a new one, their new one was not the capital.  So they had no capital but they had a city.  <br />
Now the problem was i had a spy planted.....  Now that they didn't have a capital i cannot click on the intelligence thingy (yes i also tried the Espionage button too, but that didn't work either.<br />
I even tried sending another spy but it said i have spies witheveryone..<br />
<br />
So i cant do spy ops on them. and that sucks.  Im sure this is a bug rather than an intentional feature..  Even bug is perhaps not the correct word.. just perhaps something they didn't expect to happen.<br />
<br />
The bit about them not having a capital perhaps also wasn't intended.. Although i do think their &quot;enemy civ always has a capital after you capture it&quot; does suck a bit.. cos i loved that little bit where the only real way to prevent the moving capital upon capture in civ2 was to cature the cities around it...and even when it did move you got a &quot;English government escapes to &lt;wherever&gt;&quot; message , which was cool <br />
:)   <br />
<br />
But oh well,  hopefully they fix this issue</div></div><hr />

Furthur more, this kind of crap, if it exists on the release version should have been patched within a week.<br />
<br />
They said this is the 7th submission!<br />
<br />
Why do you people think they need 7 submissions?  Because there are so many bugs to fix it required 7 sets of revisions to get it right.<br />
<br />
It simply confirms what I have been saying all along, this game was never playtested at all.<br />
<br />
I can't believe Sid would even allow Infogrames to do something to his flagship product.  Just goes to show how a couple of awards can get to someone's head REAL QUICK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As in Civ3 as released works quite well and we've been having lots of fun playing it.  Now they're tweaking and fixing bugs - not show stoppers.<br />
<br />
Then in the attempt to fix certain bugs they found they had created NEW showstoppers with the patch.  Like in tweaking corruption they found that now courthouses can result in negative corruption.  Or in fixing the bombard anywhere on the map bug they created a game crash - stuff like that (made up examples - I have no inside info.)<br />
<br />

Imagine if they didnt release CivIII until Dec 1st???? People would be *****ing up the opposite ends of the post &quot;Wheres CivIII&quot;...&quot;They holding it for the holiday rush to jack up prices&quot;...&quot;Wahh!!!&quot;.<br />
<br />
However, I do believe they have been play testing it for quiet some time. However, being that I own this product as well, I do expect higher quality and a better response time. Even with the blundered release of &quot;Star Trek: Empires at War&quot; they did have patches out the next week after release. So far Firaxis/Infogrames/Sid have done little to nothing to resolve the fault issues for civIII.<br />
<br />
And for all of you who are praying that the Multi-Player &quot;patch&quot; will be released soon... save it. The Multi-Player is coming in the form of an &quot;expansion&quot; that you will be able to &quot;purchase&quot; and then you will be able to wait for the patch to make it work properly... a month after you buy it.<br />

Wrong.  I am railing here because I have plumped down a lot of money for a broken game.  Thats it.  End of story.  <br />
<br />
I am going to keep railing on this and other boards.  If I save even one soul from wasting money on a game that is unpatched a FULL MONTH after release, then it will be worth it.<br />

It also gives me some entertainment for my money laughing at fanboys who kiss Sid's ass with every post</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure if they had any show stoppers after release they'd be patched, but since it's minor stuff, why release a patch a week?  You guys are whiners.  Whiners will always whine about something, so then you'd be whining &quot;Why release so many patches?  I can't even keep 'em straight.  I want to play, not download patches.  Can't they just release one big patch?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">von Brumi</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Minor? Air Sup is not a minor bug, it IS a show stopper, making the game unplayable on higher difficulty. It IS the biggest possible bug that could be released, as it comes fairly late in the game, but then it spoils it completely. Two patches would be very fine, with the first one making the game usable, the second being the fine tuning set. <br />
<br />
I guess you just got it in a shiny box, and like the title graphic. You would not call it a minor bug if it was your problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Heffalump</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game would have benefitted from a proper beta (like any large project) but it's still highly playable. I certainly don't think the Air Sup issue is a &quot;showstopper&quot;. Hell, in Civ2 the AI couldn't even use a Carrier (among other glaring lapses) yet we played on.<br />
<br />
Why worry that they're taking time with the patch? Maybe it's a sign of caution? Some companies will rush patches or new release versions out the door .... half of which end up patching some function that a previous, poorly-tested patch broke. <br />
<br />
Moreover such lengthy testing would hint that they're not just patching small technical glitches, but making changes to the AI or other rules with gameplay consequences. With game of this complexity it takes time to identify the possible exploits &amp; problems such changes could end up causing.<br />
<br />
So be patient. Stop moaning. If you all don't like Civ as is then go read a book or something for a few weeks.</div></div><hr />

That's certain a pretty significant bug.  I tested air units and then stopped building them because they weren't very effective and won the game by space ship anyway.  *shrug*  I worked with what was there and still really enjoyed the game.<br />
<br />
I've seen a lot of software come out over the last couple decades, and I really don't see a game that's quite playable and enjoyable with various bugs that will most likely be fixed within about a month of release as something to get too excited about.  And besides... even if it was HORRIBLE to the point of being unplayable and/or unenjoyable, whining is pointless.  Just return the game and play something else.</div></div><hr />

Thing is, I shelled out to buy the game.  I am the customer.  If I want to vent, I will vent.  Firaxis does deserve every bit of criticism it gets.  <br />
<br />
Say what you want, but no first patch should take a freakin' month!  Not for a game that was as highly anticipated as this one.  <br />
<br />
Firaxis has shown no regard for their customers.  No concern.  Why is nobody performing any kind of damage control.  Shoot, we're not even worth them attempting to spin the situation.  We've heard NOTHING.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jdurg</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really can't whine and moan about the patch, only because the game is quite playable to my regards, and the &quot;bugs&quot; haven't affected me.  Also, I'm glad that they are spending time working on the patch.  I'd rather see them wait and release it late like they are doing now than see them rush it and break other features.  I am also an owner of High Heat Major League Baseball 2002.  After HH2001, there was HUGE anticipation for HH2002.  3DO had given a huge list of great things that they planned on implementing in HH2002.  Well, they didn't come through with more than one or two things.  They broke previously working/correct things from last year's game, and the stuff they added was so buggy that half the time, the game would crash.  That, my friends, is a showstopper.  We had to flood 3DO with e-mails in order for them to even think about making a patch.  Finally, about 2.5 to 3 months later, a patch was released.  The patch broke features that worked in the game, and didn't fix any of the showstoppers.  Their reasoning behind why it broke things and didn't repair anything was that when trying to fix minor bugs, they created major bugs, but didn't feel like going back to correct them.  <br />
<br />
So THAT is bad customer service.  I think Firaxis/Infogrames is doing a fine job.</div></div><hr />

The store I bought it from (Media Play) and many other stores have no return policies. Although the price tag said $49.99 the game rang up as $39.99. I wish I could return the game and buy something else. <br />
Honestly, I dont really mind the many many bugs but the problem I see is that I dont really feel like playing the game anymore. MP would be great and a helpful manual would be useful but I hear that none of these will be coming except maybe in an expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps part of the problem here is the over all quality of the industry, especially with the large scale online games (EQ was barely playable for over a week and many significant bugs still existed in the game a year after release).  After years of that a game that is quite playable and enjoyable upon release and has a patch come out within a month sounds great.<br />
<br />
But then... when I think way back - I don't remember Zork needing any patches at all.  I don't remember Mule needing patches.  I remember the patches for the original Civ being much more minor than this.  I don't remember any patches for the original Bard's Tale.<br />
<br />
Hmmm... am I just forgetting in the haze of time?<br />
<br />
I don't think so - I think as games have gotten more complicated they've far out stripped their testing and the result has been a decline in quality over the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peteus</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not a decline in quality exactly, but definitely a decline in Quality Standards!  I agree that the ability of software companies to test their products has been outstripped by the complexity that newer processors and especially video cards allow.<br />

<br />
Its evident civ3 was rushed, from bugs to little things like the editor not having a mini-map.  now a mini-map for an editor is a very standard, and simple feature.  not to mention civ2 had it as well.<br />
<br />
Minor issue, i know, but it goes to show that it was rushed.  I assume those who make the release date are not programmers; it wouldn't even surprise me if they didn't consult them about how long it might take.<br />
<br />
So i reckon the programmers realised that the release date was unrealistic, and that they couldn't finish it by then.<br />
<br />
As a result, they probably thought. We'll do a half a$$sed job now, and fix it with patches.<br />
Well i hope thats the case, since that would mean we'd get some of these issues fixed</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no excuse for not having it finished - its not like they were creating a new game here. Most of the normal dev issues with game design were already solved with civ 1, 2 and alpha centauri - all of which played superbly without a patch. <br />
Lazy programming has spread into one of the last bastions of quality - and I'm not sure who that leaves you can trust to make a good game out of the box.</div></div><hr />

I played AO from start. No, Civ 3 isn't as bad, not much could be. But AC, civ 1, and civ 2 worked out of the box without any game stopping issues. I'm not going to claim a product is &quot;great&quot; by comparing it to other POS titles. It is great if it compares with other titles that worked out of the box. and this game isn't great.</div></div><hr />

The game has two major show stopping bugs, in the combat resolution calculation not being random nor following the attack defense stats as described and existed in the books, and the stupid culture flips 2 turns after capturing a city. these two things have made me quit playing the game, and I'm telling everyone not to buy it until they fix the bugs. <br />
<br />
...... <br />
<br />
First, I have to agree with the fact that no patch is needed in the good old days (Infocom's text adventure never need a patch and their phaser can catch every single thing you type in as long as its english and throw back a funny answer to you:lol: )<br />
<br />
However, beside the major one on Air Superiority, I won't say there are many major bugs (att/def/mov points is NOT a bug but individual preferrences and balance).  Before I get shot down with the thing you guys have in your hand, please, listen for a sec :cool: <br />
<br />
1)  Combat resolution IS random.  Its just that the random seed is saved whenever you save a game and that causes the results to be the same whenever you load a game.  (Had that same issue with Football Manager 2001/2002 and those who own it will understand what I am trying to say)  I believe enough is being said on this issue and I shall stop here.<br />
<br />
2)  Culture flip.  While there are some randomness in this, every city has a chance of flipping every turn.  And for flipping to occur, the cultural value of the two Civ is compared.  For captured cities, it is obvious that the cultural point of the old Civ is higher than the one that is conquering it.  I 100% agree with the old Civ get back all their culture when they liberate the city.  Paris did not lost its culture after the Allies liberated it from the Nazi did it?:lol: <br />
So, with the high cultural diff in a captured city, its obvious that the flip happens much much often.<br />
<br />
3)  Lost of units in a flip.  This has happen to me before too but I am willing to take it as a feature.  I still remember in the old Civ1 and Civ2 days where my diplomat can just walk right next to a city that I am having a war with and defended by say 8 rifleman and I can just straight buy them over with the 8 units intact inside!!  Be real guys, since when do you get a revolt together with all the old units intact?  As to kick the units out of the city, whats the point of flipping if those units can just attack it the same turn??<br />
<br />
Thats just my 2 cents on this matter of bugs.  I love the game and honestly this is one game that I find it still playable even with the air bug and I am sure glad that a patch is on the way:king:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhandom</div><div class="date">Nov 28, 2001, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Combat resolution IS random.

<br />
No, it is not. I'm sorry if you haven't followed the other threads, but:<br />
<br />
The seed, if there is even one, seems to be calculated or affected by a variety of factors. The same series of random numbers aren't generated in different battles if you reload - A first battle that you lose with 4 to one odds may be won if you first fight a 2 to 1 battle. For instance, I lost 3 Immortals to a single spearman ina size 1 city, no terrain, whereas attacking the same place with a /spearman!!!/ was won if done first. Furthermore, the random number generator is most definately broken, as the percentage of absolutely absurd combat results is very high, on the order of 50%+ of the battles not coming close to a statistical curve - I'm talking 4 to 1 odds battles where 3 hits are inflicted against the powerful unit with none suffered by the weak.<br />
<br />
2) Culture flip. While there are some randomness in this, every city has a chance of flipping every turn. And for flipping to occur, the cultural value of the two Civ is compared. For captured cities, it is obvious that the cultural point of the old Civ is higher than the one that is conquering it. I 100% agree with the old Civ get back all their culture when they liberate the city. Paris did not lost its culture after the Allies liberated it from the Nazi did it? <br />
So, with the high cultural diff in a captured city, its obvious that the flip happens much much often. <br />

Again, read the threads. While some culture flips do seem to be based on city by city analysis (and very inconsistently, at that - I watched a city from an inferior culture in my heartland on a different continent from its capital, surounded and totally enveloped by 3 1000 culture cities 2 and 3 squares from it, survive over 50 turns before finally flipping), many seem to be based on a cultural analysis that says you WILL lose some cities to this other culture (and not necessarily a superior one), and all you will be able to do is change which cities actually flip. As I explained in one thread, I had the russians, reduced to one city on madagascar, take over 5 cities they had lost over 50 turns in the past from my culture which tripled thiers (on the /west/ coast of africa, farthest from madagascar in some cases) , over the course of 3 turns, and no matter what I built or how close they were to my forbidden palace, I could not prevent 5 cities from flipping. all I could do is affect which cities flipped.<br />
<br />
Finally, there is no justification for culture flips 2 turns after capturing a city, losing a dozen troops sent to quash rebellion. There really isn't any justification for culture flips to a society you are at war with. There is no justification for destroying all of the structures in the city when you capture it.<br />
<br />
3) Lost of units in a flip. This has happen to me before too but I am willing to take it as a feature. I still remember in the old Civ1 and Civ2 days where my diplomat can just walk right next to a city that I am having a war with and defended by say 8 rifleman and I can just straight buy them over with the 8 units intact inside!! Be real guys, since when do you get a revolt together with all the old units intact? As to kick the units out of the city, whats the point of flipping if those units can just attack it the same turn??<br />
<br />
Ummm... so the old system was a bit unrealistic, its ok for this system to be more screwed up? Remember, you could DEFEND against that with your own diplomats. You could defend against that by having a superior culture or different government. It costed the enemy something, and often a hell of a lot, to capture a city full of units. There is no defense for current flips. There is no way to plan for them, except to raze the cities as you take them, or only fight to total genocide of your enemy.<br />
<br />
If you are happy with the game, great. But a lot of us expected more from the game than a half tested, buggy product. Because there are a LOT of little bugs and untested features beyond the major ones listed above, and I expect more from Firaxis.</div></div><hr />

Here I see it happen again, exactly in the same way, no Multiplayer and tons of bad bugs in every part of the game. That company has never been a quality company. The only thing they made right is probably graphics. But, hey, we are not judging games on graphics, do we? Yes? Then quit here and go to (place any shooter's webpage in here).<br />
No? then go to http://www.freeciv.org</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no correct randomness in Civ3 - I already developed a FEEL for the battles I am about to win or lose. About every 3rd or 4th encounter is majorly tweaked in your or enemies favour, and you will lose your best elite unit on some poor pikeman if you're unaware of the junky random generator (its actually a buggy program segment, I assume) at work here.<br />
<br />
I went so far to save games before, then replay different encounters at different places on the map - each encounter that was due to lose miserably, lost miserably - even with movement 3 units not being able to retreat from a static battle with movement 1 unit. Usually, for example, you will have your elite rider of 5 green life decimate enemy spearman to 1 life with no losses, and then losa 5 life in sucession until it DIES.<br />
<br />
I am a computer veteran. I remember how hewlett-packard solved random number seed problems 25 years ago: They reseeded rand with every keyboard timer delay (the time in ms between your key-strokes), effectively introducing the real-world random number into the formula. Seems noone remmebers this solution today...</div></div><hr />

1) For instance, I lost 3 Immortals to a single spearman ina size 1 city, no terrain, whereas attacking the same place with a /spearman!!!/ was won if done first. <br />
A battle outcome between two participants is no longer random once the seed is saved.  Change the players and you can have a different outcome.  Your example doesn't mean much.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the random number generator is most definately broken, as the percentage of absolutely absurd combat results is very high, on the order of 50%+ of the battles not coming close to a statistical curve <br />
Actually your perception of &quot;absolutely absurd combat results&quot; doesn't fit on the curve.  Immortal against Spearman will lose nearly a third of the time.  The Spearman takes no damage more than 1 out of 20 times.  Three instances of this is in a row is definately within the realms of statistcal probability.  Spearman defeats spearman nearly 15% of the time, hardly unusual. <br />
<br />
Finally, there is no justification for culture flips 2 turns after capturing a city, losing a dozen troops sent to quash rebellion. There really isn't any justification for culture flips to a society you are at war with. There is no justification for destroying all of the structures in the city when you capture it.<br />
Sure there's justification.  A dozen troops can hardly control a city of size 20, can they?  Throw in civil unrest, foreign citizens, and it becomes very likely.  On the other hand, a peaceful city of size 1 will never flip if a dozen troops are stationed within.  All structures in a city aren't destroyed when you capture it, just a large percentage.  Furthermore, Great Wonders aren't destroyed.<br />
<br />
Lost of units in a flip. <br />
Don't let it flip.  Or bombard it down to a small size before taking it over.  Or raze the city.  Or immediately repopulate with your people.  It's not like you don't have any options.<br />
<br />
If you are happy with the game, great. But a lot of us expected more from the game than a half tested, buggy product. Because there are a LOT of little bugs and untested features beyond the major ones listed above, and I expect more from Firaxis. <br />
It really sounds like you want a game where you can use a save and reload cheat.  You can't do it in this game.  Also, Firaxis was very careful not to use a public demo and to do all their testing in house.  Though it could have been more extensive, I find their testing to adequate as Civ3 in its current form is very playable and enjoyable.  The way some people are describing it makes it sound like it was like Pools of Radiance or whatever that game was a couple of months ago.  Do any of these bugs make it impossible to win?  Or immediately crash the game?  Or have no simple work arounds?  Sheesh.</div></div><hr />

The new feature that they added that was &quot;new&quot; to the Civ series, air superiority, is completely broke. It makes modern air warfare unthinkable.<br />
<br />
The game had time to be tested and worked properly before its release, and the new features obviously werent thoroughly tested. A side note, borders, trade, all that is not new stuff, just ripped from SMAC, CTP, etc..<br />

<br />
People, if you fight 1000 combats, you are going to see a lot of 100-to-1 outcomes. The random number generator is NOT broken. Even EXTREMELY bad random number generators have such a small randomness that no human could detect it without some serious computer analysis. Trust me, I play with MATLAB and C++ all day.  The seed may indeed be saved for a purpose: to prevent people from re-loading games ad infinitum so they don't ever have to lose a battle. <br />
<br />
I guess this must be the reason why sequels have such a difficult time succeeding. Not only do people expect a great, bug-free, replayable game, but they expect it to be superior in all ways (to their mind) to its predecessor, which in this case is arguably the best turn-based strategy game ever released.<br />
<br />
And to whoever said that the broken air superiority was the worst possible bug that could happen, I hope the next game you buy re-formats your hard disk the first time you run it. Easy on the hyperbole.<br />

<br />
As for this getting rid of the reload cheat, it simply makes it worse.  1) small number of HP makes it likely 2 outcomes will be very different. whereas civ2 , 2 outcomes would be more likely to be a bit similar (ie in civ2 you'd be wasting your time reloading in the hope that your caravel is going to kill that enemy battleship) - and this is what helped civ2 a lot.. there wasn't AS MUCH gain to reload-cheat.<br />
<br />
Also the way to cheat it to reload and do different battles in different orders..  which IMO  seems an easier way to cheat than just reload.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the buildings that get destroyed when you capture a city, so far from what i can tell i think that you ALWAYS loose all of the culture buildings  (except wonders).  so if the city only had culture producing buildings then you'd loose everything.  Also i think you always keep the aqueduct/hospital if it had one. I have captured cities with non culture producing things, like factories, barracks, granerys, and such.<br />
Well from two games that seems to be the case to me.. will take more notice of it next game</div></div><hr />

First, I have to agree with the fact that no patch is needed in the good old days (Infocom's text adventure never need a patch)<br />
<br />
Ahem, Zork I had at least ten patches, with more than 20 bugs in the first version. They just weren't published to the public; newer versions were simply released when they ran out of older ones. <br />
<br />
Some of these bugs even prevented you from finishing the game if you performed the wrong action.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PATCH (HOPEFULLY) SET FOR NEXT WEEK<br />
(26 November 2001, 19:20 EST) Jeff Morris posted the good news<br />
<br />
Hey guys. I wanted to drop you a line about the upcoming patch. We've sent it off to testing and baring any unforeseen problems it should be available some time next week. That is not a promise that it WILL be available next week however, since any number of things can cause a reset. We're on v1.14f right now, it being the 7th patch we've submitted to testing, only to find showstoppers.<br />
<br />
To avoid any unecessary... drama :) nothing is set in stone. Problems could be found, forcing one more round of programming and testing. Fellow Firaxian Dan Magaha supplemented the report by commenting that old save game files should be backwards compatible with the patch as will old BIC files. Many thanks to Jeff for the update. <br />
