<br />
Our goal: We are a citizen group that devotes itself against war and aggressive foreign policies. We, however, do think that a defensive war is legitimate, only if the war was declared by the other nation. We are not a uniform group of people, as we respect the free speech right given to the people of this land.<br />
<br />
These are our most important beliefs:<br />
<br />
 1.No aggressive war is legitimate, may it be for tiles, cities or ressources.<br />
 2.We support heavy trading to access ressources and techs we do not own.<br />
 3.We support any war declared by the AI, but it must end as soon as possible(as soon as the AI wants to talk with us).<br />

When the citizen group will reach 15 members, the group will begin defining its position in any matter.<br />
<br />
The politic definition protocol is the following:<br />
<br />
 1.The member who desires to create/change a politic posts a discussion thread in the citizen forum (ex.: COP dicussion:[politic]).<br />
 2.At least 48 hours after the discussion is posted, a poll can be posted about the integration of the new position in the COP.<br />
          a)The poll shall remain opened until 72 hours or until the quorum is reached. The quorum is defined as 66% of the membership that posted at CFC in the last two days.<br />
          b)Each poll shall have the following options: Adopt, Reject, Abstain.<br />
<br />
N.B.: The group's position is not binding in any way for the member. Each member can have a different position than the group if he wishes to.</div></div><hr />

Even though I am in the Brotherhood of Steel, I believe in these ideals and I feel some of them can be combined. For example a goal of the BoS is to have a strong peacetime army. If we have a strong army in peace, we can easily end any war that is declared against us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so if they demand money or techs, or anything for peace, we should say no. Being a peacemonger doesn't mean being kicked around by the inanimate object that is the AI. only sign peace when it is peace for peace, no more, no less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*Paalikles has launched the &quot;Let's give Peace a Chance&quot; campaign.<br />
<br />
@Shaitan: I take it that you do not want to join this group as you want to keep more options open. (victory conditions) Imo, the presence of citizen groups and their beliefs will influence the way the game will turn - and this group will perhaps advocate strongly the way of Peace. Hopefully people will feel that their opinion has a good deal of influence on the way the game progresses, and thus citizen groups will be an important aspect of the democracy game without even becoming political.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fier Canadien</div><div class="date">Apr 29, 2003, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, everyone, we've reached 11 members. I believe that time is ripe to discuss what to propose as the official politic of the group. Don't forget that polling will only begin when we reach 15 members, and that may take quite some time.<br />
<br />
So, we can do it that way: someone submits an idea in thhis thread, if he/she feels that the members are interested, he/she posts a discussion thread. As for the rest of it, look in the first post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">Apr 29, 2003, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@Paalikles: I'm not concerned with victory conditions but with in game opportunities. A restriction to never declare war precludes things like annexation, snatch and grab and preemptive strikes. Those are things I would support under the correct conditions so I can't endorse a never make war charter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gingerbread Man</div><div class="date">Apr 29, 2003, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I must admit that some wars are beneficial and necessary (e.g. wars for oil :rolleyes: ) however I would say in those situations avoid darstadly tactics as described on realms beyond. In those situations lets not RoP rape or sneak attack. Not just because it would be respectable, but also because it would be challenging.<br />
<br />
Remember we will we be only playing on monarch, which isn't as difficult as before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">Apr 29, 2003, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can definitely agree with that. ROP abuse causes a huge reputation hit. It's also simply not a very noble thing to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've always wanted to be a hippie. Ironically, the guy who made this thread is canadian :) Anyways, ya, I'd like to join, but we should support legite wars, like if the AI attacks us, we should allow the war to go on as long as needed. But, say we provoke a war, we could make like a little demonstration, packed with mini picket signs and all the like. Just...not so hippie.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gingerbread Man</div><div class="date">May 10, 2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My suggestions for war politics:<br />
<br />
1) War is bad, and is to be avoided at all costs.<br />
<br />
2) Every possible means to the end are to be considered before war is.<br />
<br />
3) If war is declared on us when unprepared, peace will be made once <br />
     a) we regain every city we lost, and <br />
     b) capture one of their cities for every one of ours they raze, even if it is autoraze<br />
<br />
4) If we dont have a resource, we will explore every trade opportunity before we decide war is to be used to aquire the resource<br />
<br />
5) We will declare peace as soon as straight peace is offered, e.g. peace for peace would be accepted, peace for peace +10g would not.<br />
<br />
6) We will not be kicked around beause we are peacemongers. The enemy has no right to choose our decisions.<br />
<br />
7) We understand that a defense force is needed, but offence military is needed if we want to ward off invaders effectively. If we are gifted with a military larger than an opponent's, we will not abuse our position of power.<br />
<br />
I know these are fairly warlike for some, but I call it 'being peaceful, but not weak'. If you really want peacemongerage, read CharisTale 2. There Charis was deliberately peaceful and weak. But here we will be strong, yet kind to our neighbours.</div></div><hr />
