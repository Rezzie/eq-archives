<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">May 20, 2002, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the complete writeup of my game. It took me quite some time to finish, and while it's not all that graphically intensive, it does have a lot of information in it. It's really, REALLY a spoiler and I go very much into my own personal strategy, so if you are still playing the GOTM or plan to play it, I ask that you not read it in the interest of fairness. :) <br />
<br />
Here's the address: <br />

Sulla's GOTM7 (http://www.geocities.com/lcsullla/GOTM7) <br />

Have fun reading and I hope you enjoy it! Any comments can be posted on this thread and will be answered. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zachriel</div><div class="date">May 21, 2002, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent play. Several things of note:<br />
<br />
The Iroquois lived peaceably for thousands of years, protected to some degree by their relative isolation, but also due to Hiawatha's honest dealings. <br />
<br />
The Iroquois only went to war when forced to, and only after a declaration of war by the Russians. The Russians were obviously a threat to world peace, so Hiawatha used all his diplomatic skills to unite the world against this menace. The Iroquois deserved their Golden Age, and Hiawatha his election as Secretary-General. <br />

May a hundred spirits clear the briers from thy path to the world of the Wise One.</div></div><hr />

P.S. Good effort, Sulla.<br />

<br />
(And why is you userid sullla, and your web page sulla??)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">May 21, 2002, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good question! The name comes from Lucius Cornelius Sulla, a Roman politician and general of the first century BC. Unfortunately, that name is often taken - as it was at CivFanatics - so I often have to add an extra &quot;l&quot; to the name. <br />
<br />
Glad to get some positive feedback! :king:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawrence</div><div class="date">May 22, 2002, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent writeup!<br />
<br />
What I can draw from it is that diplomatic victorys really depends on a diplomatic tongue.:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, am I the only one who *DIDN'T* get a settler out of that hut? :) Mine was abandoned, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">May 26, 2002, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Preserve random seed&quot; was off, which meant that huts opened on the same turn gave different results in this game. Actually, as far as I can tell most people did not get a settler from the first hut. But everyone who did get one has been sure to mention it since it helped them out so much. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 26, 2002, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wonder how many people who didn't get a settler from the hut went on to win...</div></div><hr />
