<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Sep 24, 2002, 11:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a true story of course, that happened to... me :D<br />
Today totally by hazard I decided to go to the post office on my way home, to buy stamps. Since all the cashiers were full, I walked to the automatic cashier. When I was there I was surprised to see a wonderful blue screen with the following sentences:<br />
<br />
&quot;Erreur d'ecriture sur lecteur C:<br />
Les donnees non sauvees seront perdues.<br />
Appuyez sur une touche pour continuer&quot;<br />
<br />
Which means:<br />
Error writing on the C: disk<br />
All data not saved will be lost<br />
Press a key to continue...<br />
<br />
No need to be Sherlock Holmes to guess that machine was running.... a certain OS! I would never imagine:<br />
1) Post office would be foolish enough to run such OS in those machines<br />
2) Those machines would be so complex that they require a powerful processor and an unstable OS to run.<br />
<br />
Anyway I was quite disappointed I had not my digital camera with me, to take a historical photo :D Wow. French post cashiers, powered with Micro$h*t Winblows... Who would have guessed such a thing would happen one day? It's nearly the end of the world, the evil is now controlling not only the world PCs and PDA, but also everything. One day, maybe my fridge, my telephone...</div></div><hr />

He hates Macs and so? :p Well, seriously, everyone has his/her own opinion but it was not the point here, Mac/PC war ;) It's all about that the Evil is near from controlling the world.<br />
<br />
Ah, a last point: so far I didn't see any machine stealing money from you (i.e. they don't give you the change back) like windows cashiers :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah! Can you blame them for wanting to make some dough!<br />
<br />
Is that any better they show a message...  Error EEfDE:015 etc...<br />
<br />
Oh, I'd rather have nothing...so i cannot even look for an online fix properly...... :p<br />
<br />
Macs suck!! :D :D :D :D<br />
<br />
But of course, that's only my personal opinion(and that of many others :D) If you have good experiences with macs then you should use one!</div></div><hr />

Okay okay, j/k. Back on topic, so far if I make a list of machines running Windows, there are:<br />
_ post office cashiers<br />
_ automatic train tickets machines<br />
_ cash machines.<br />
...<br />
And I already saw all those with a blue screen.<br />
<br />
Ah, yes I forgot at the airport: Orly (Paris, France). Nice blue screen too. There were 3 panels announcing flights gates and one of them was crashed :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Sep 27, 2002, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw an article with an airport terminal BSODed also. :)<br />
