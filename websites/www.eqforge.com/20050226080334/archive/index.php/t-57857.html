<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 05, 2003, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These build queues emphasize three goals in roughly this priority order:<br />
<br />
(1) We need a far greater number of engineers than we currently have, mainly due to the upcoming discoveries of refrigeration and railroad.<br />
<br />
(2) We have lots of big cities and Adam Smith so building libraries now makes sense. This is to be done in all size 12+ cities ASAP. Since the emphasis is currently on science libriares are prioritized ahead of banks.<br />
<br />
(3) Military buildup for peacekeeping in Hell, mainly in EF, FW and Naer.<br />
<br />
&quot;RB&quot; means that the item in question should be finished as quickly as possible. Due to the current emphasis on science this must be done sparingly but we have lots of cash, are getting a caravan delivery bonus soon and will be getting some $$ from taxes for one or two more turns so some rush buying can take place. Since there are lots of RB's the priority should be on cities with long build queues (Neu for example) and/or the cities with the largest amount of trade.<br />
<br />
Always vote for 0. It makes it easy to see if a particular build queue has majority support. For example, if 0 gets 5 votes and build queue 12 (Ipec) only 2 it means the build queue does not have majority support and should be changed. If you do not vote for something please indicate how the build queue in question should be changed.</div></div><hr />
