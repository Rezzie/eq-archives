<br />
We have two decisions to make - where to place our next city and what to build in LC when it's ready wit the settler.<br />
The first I think we should move NE and see if we can find some nice spot. The land to the west is practically ours anyway.<br />
The second probably should be two defenders, one for LC and one for SSC.<br />
<br />
I don't know how long it takes to mine, but I assume you are sure we'll have time to place the city before it's done?:) <br />
<br />
BTW, is that barbarian leader's name really Langobardi, or did you make that up?:)</div></div><hr />

Ipec settler, two thoughts.  move North-NW-NW and settle unshielded green, using Whale.  Other thought is to explore NE and settle first good location</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2003, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it takes 10 settler turns to mine a hill.  <br />
<br />
One thing I often do when I want to make sure a settler/eng doesn't go &quot;too far&quot; is to put him to work, then immediately click on him to clear the order.  That way, he won't do any work next turn until you give him the mine order again.  He still accumulates the work, but it makes you think &quot;do I want him to work another turn&quot; before he does it that round.  Then just keep track in the log how many turns he has worked, or just project out when he will finish. I do it by tracking turns since I always screw up date calculations, especially when we change turn-duration like we will at 1000bc.  <br />
<br />
Since he started in 1400 I THINK that means he'll normally finish in 975 (but I could be wrong ;) ).  If that is right, make darn sure he isn't working at the end of the 1000bc turn so he doesn't automatically work the 10th turn if we don't have the city built by then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2003, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hold on...Now that I think about this, You need to stop the settler one turn earlier than what I just said.  If he has 9 turns of work built up, putting him back to work will instantly build the mine, screwing the whole thing up.  Stop him at 8 turns (1050bc).  Then when the 2nd settler shows up you can start the mine (9 turns of work) and build the city on that turn.  Then he'll complete the mine the next turn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2003, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IIRC the settler is ready next turn, which means we'll be able to build the city in 6 turns, tops. If the settler started working last turn, it will be done two turns after we build the city, which gives us a little marginal. This was quick math, so someone please double-check it:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blissful_Zen</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It will take the settler 5 turns to get ON the hill and on the 6th one he will able to build the SSC. Which is 1000 BC. This is the 3rd  turn of mining, so the mine will be done the turn after 1000 BC, if 10 settler turns makes a mine. <br />
<br />
I like that nonsheilded grassland to the north west by the whale. Looks like only one space will be shared by it and Ipec, and the pattern of fishes and whales, makes it possible to find another special in the non explored water spaces.<br />
<br />
Also what are we going to call these next 2 cities. Ideas anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Apr 19, 2003, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">10 turns to mine is correct.  You guys may be right, but it would be a Disaster if the settler finished before the LC Settler built the city.  We might want to waste one turn of Mining to be sure.<br />
<br />
Neumatic is working the Fish.  Perhaps we want the River Shield for a bit faster production and slower growth?  Not sure.<br />
<br />
Do we have a city that can build a Caravan for our wonder?  I don't think so, one needs to build a Temple them Caravan. LC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Apr 19, 2003, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my counting, even if the settler can't make it off the river onto the hill with 2/3 movement left, it should still be able to get the city built before the mine is done.<br />
<br />
The settler can get to the site on 1050 BC.<br />
The city can be built on 1000 BC.<br />
The mine should finish on 975 BC.<br />
<br />
We can even try to gain a turn on the settler getting to the spot by trying to cut the corner at the river with 1/3 movement left(yellow line).  Even if it doesn't make it, it won't lose any turns on getting to the city spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">Apr 20, 2003, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good work Jayne. :)<br />
<br />
DOM's calculations seem correct from my point of view, but I think if someone wanted to double check that would be good. <br />
<br />
I think LC would be the ideal city for getting a Caravan after the temple is done.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I feel that one of our upcoming cities should be producing military units. Also, if a city is named after me, call it Naervana. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blissful_Zen</div><div class="date">Apr 21, 2003, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Duke's calculations are correct. The mine will be done in 975. The SSC will be built in 1000BC at latest, we might get it a turn early, but not a turn late.<br />
<br />
I particulary don't like exploring to much with settlers, and would prefer we move Ipec settler to that spot by the whale just the the NW. So we dont first meet a new civ with a settler or worse the barbs.<br />
<br />
I like the city name Naervana. Do we have any other ideas. What are we naming our SSC?<br />
<br />
What city/ies will be suppling the defnese units for LC, and the 2 new cities.:cool:</div></div><hr />

I'm for LC supplying guards/defences for itself and the SSC. But think it's all right if the new city (Ipec settler) supplies it themselves.:)</div></div><hr />
