Some issues, like switching to a new government and trying to hold on to Memphis already have discussions.  It's important that we take the time now to identify any other key problems.  <br />
<br />
No need to discuss everything in detail in this one thread, separate discussions can be started for that.  Each of those discussions can continue independently, but an overall assessment of where we are and where we should go is needed.<br />
<br />
Also it would be helpful to list the areas we are strong.  A lot has been accomplished, and that must not be forgotten.<br />
<br />
Here is a starter:<br />
<br />
Successes:<br />
Our military is among the strongest, and we haven't reached the unit limit yet.  The war with Egypt came out more-or-less OK, given that it came when we weren't really prepared.<br />
<br />
Problems:<br />
<br />
 Memphis is in extreme danger of flipping, which would give Egypt renewed access to horses.  Retaking it would have to wait, unless we want to take the rep hit of renewed war before the 20 turns of peace are over.<br />
 There is still a lot of unclaimed land nearby, and the other civilizations may soon have the means to claim it, if we don't get there first.<br />
 We are weak in culture compared to everyone.  Once behind, it is next to impossible to catch up, unless the AIs start beating up on each other and destroying culture-producing buildings in the process.<br />
 As we move to a more enlightened government type, a lot of improvements will be necessary to take full advantage of the land.<br />
 There seems to be increasing apathy regarding conduct of the game.  This might be normal summertime blues, or it might be an organic problem.  How do we revitalize participation in the game?</div></div><hr />

The turnchats are too short to let the game remain very interesting. It has slipped to at least &quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;slightly interesting&quot; <br />
[/B]<br />
 We are still undecided on a coarse to follow. A path hasn't been laid out on how we want to play. Something like: &quot;We'll fend off the Egyotians till we get everything south of Memphis, we sue for peace, fill up our land and revolt into Republic. We focus then on expansion and development of land + culture + production. When we reach *** we'll go ***.<br />
When *** happens we respond by ***, unless *** is happening as well.&quot;<br />
  We need to reorganise our units to benefit from it's defensive strength and get rid of it's weaknesses. Are we trying to get the warriors in America home ? Are we going to disband them ? <br />
  How do we stop other civs from claiming our land ? There are 2 aztec settler-pairs in our lands. And Western Eswuilione is under severe thread of being overrun.</div></div><hr />

And send a unit to check out the western lands to make sure noone settled there.</div></div><hr />
