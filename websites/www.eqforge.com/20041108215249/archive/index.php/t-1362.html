When can we expect the release of the scenario? Or can you tell us more details?<br />
<br />
 Today maybe. But this scenario takes place 1914-1918<br />
<br />
Today for sure http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif, but of course not during WWI, so your flag is correct http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

The Black, Red, and White flag is quite correct for Imperial Germany. This looks to be an impressive collection of scenarios. I too look foward to it's release.<br />

So you have either the wrong civ or the wrong flag. Germany is black-red-gold (or yellow)<br />

I thought it was dark blue. Well, anyway, I was wrong about the flag, sorry. About Danzig and Königsberg; they aren't German now, but they were back then. I'm not sure of Danzig, though, I think it was a enclave in Poland with an own government who was pro-German. Am I right Alcibiaties/BeBro?<br />

It was controlled by The Geramn Empire on one side, Imperial Russia on another, and The Austro-Hungarian Empire on the thrid. Danzig was a German city at this time. Warsaw was a Russian city, the Austrians controlled Gallicia. This arrangement went back to the Napolenoic wars. After the Great war, a Poland was created by the allies, and it fought a successful war with the Soviets (circa 1920). Danzig was called a 'free city', to enable the Poles to have an outlet to the Baltic sea. WWII began here, as the German navy started bombarding the Polish garrison on September 1, 1939.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucifer</div><div class="date">Apr 21, 2001, 07:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">100% accurate? <br />
<br />
Looking at your big map Britain should have more control over iran, since they did attempt an attack from there on the eastern part of the ottoman empire...<br />
<br />
...and prehaps ireland should be moved east a little bit. not so accurate now, uh??uh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucifer</div><div class="date">Apr 21, 2001, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wheres the usa?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BeBro</div><div class="date">Apr 21, 2001, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mhm, Lucifer, I would also be careful with statements like &quot;the scenario is 100 % historical accurate.&quot;, because I think that´s impossible in Civ2 - you always have to leave out things.<br />
<br />
But I still think this will be a great scenario. The US can be created via events, and the Ireland map thing is nothing that I would call a serious mistake that would spoil the whole scn. Ok, the Iran thing has to be checked, but I think &quot;not so accurate now, uh??uh?&quot; isn´t what I would call constructive criticism...http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<br />
Good point about Iran anyway, I wasn't sure exactly how to simulate the confused political situation there. I finally decided to make the country complete neutral, but allow foreign troops to pass through the country freely.<br />

I like the First World war, and anything new on that front is sure to score majorly with me. Aaah, more Ottoman Turks for me!</div></div><hr />
