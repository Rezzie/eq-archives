HOWEVER: in one of the graphics support files with civ 2, 9 different colored shields/flags are displayed. The two extra, are barbarian red, and brown. I'm wondering if  it is at all possible to program the brown flag into the game. I've tried a couple of things, and will be pursuing it further. Comments?<br />

<br />
I've now added 3 extra tribes to push the total to twenty four. Wearing the Brown flag are the: Candadians, Huns, and the Inuit. I've set their personalities, and all that stuff, so more updates soon http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
This is true for ram, colors and many other things. I am not an expert so I cant say what else it is from the top of my head. But this is what I have noticed.<br />
<br />
My point is that I believe that there can be 8 civs 100%!<br />
<br />
I also think that civ III will have either 7 and a barb race, or a combination of civs and barbarians up to the number of 16, and I don't think that color has anything to do with it at all.<br />
<br />
I also think that in future we will see 32 civs, and possibly 128. I don't think there is need for more than 128.<br />

In an email I received a while ago from Microprose included the statement<br />
<br />
&quot;The brownflags are no longer playable&quot;<br />
<br />
Meaning:<br />
<br />
They were NOT the barbarians.<br />
<br />
By the way, if you include &quot;2 Civilizations&quot; under the amount of Civilizations in the Game.txt file, you can actually select it as a playable option, as opposed to &quot;8 Civilizations&quot;...This is because this option makes logical sense in the programming, and probably once was an option that was removed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jarred</div><div class="date">Mar 05, 2001, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">8 Civilizations should be possible, but tricky.  You have to make the programming accept 8 different tribes.  Then you must name it and then have it identified in rules.txt, and set its possible starting techs.  This could be done through differentiation, but it should be incredibly tough without decompiling the programming (Which is readable; Because Assembler loses names, it becomes unrocognizable, but you'd get a bunch of no name variables in C++, which is the language it was programmed in (Microsoft Virtual C++)</div></div><hr />

if my theory is correct if you could be the barbarian country they probably could not have wonders.</div></div><hr />

This is based on programming in Bytes. One byte is 8 bits in size. You cannot make it larger than 256 (0-255) (This is why you can't have more than 255 cities because then the next city would equal 0 and why that the resource seeds in the map editor run from 0-255 and then repeat.) unless you use something else such as integer value. Bytes are used because they are smaller in size for programming and therefore run faster.<br />
