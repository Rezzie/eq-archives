<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SkyRattlers</div><div class="date">Mar 26, 2002, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I only started doing GOTM's with #3 so when I completed the most recent one so quickly I decided to go back and play the ones I had missed.<br />
<br />
GOTM#1 proved to be no challenge at all but GOTM#2 is rediculously hard. I'm having so much trouble I decided to go read the spoilers to see how other people did. Although some other people definately had trouble dealing with the Romans, most seemed to cope and eventually conquer the world. I didn't really understand why my game had gotten so out of control especially given how easily I handled the Romans. Then I realized that it's because I'm playing with the 1.17 patch and when the GOTM#2 was played it hadn't been released yet...I'm not sure if 1.16 had even been out. So with the AI's new trend towards massive tech trading this GOTM has become a monster and I'm issuing the challenge to any of you bored enough to try to replay this GOTM with the patch. I think you might find the same results as me....you'll have no hope of staying anywhere close in tech compared to the main island of nations which means the first time you meet them it's because they have sailed the massive ocean in their caravels or galleons and are meeting your first or second galley. :P  Enjoy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2002, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Indeed, the map of GOTM II was a very nice one. ;) But I think that's the common fun of pangaea maps, if you're not on the main island. (In my game I've never even seen the main island. http://forums.civfanatics.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif)<br />
<br />
By the way, version 1.16f wasn't even out. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ribannah</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2002, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll give it a try as soon as I have finished #4, which is heading towards a cultural victory. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BillChin</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2002, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did not play GOTM2 first time around, so I decide to load it up and give it a go.  It is 230 B. C. and I am number one on the histograph without waging war.  I have contact with eight civs.  My game is far from optimal but it looks like I have my choice of victories, so I'll probably retire.  All civs are still in the Ancient Age.<br />
<br />
I build a lot of settlers and warriors, keep research near max.  After mapmaking, I build galleys and fling them across the ocean.  Once I got one galley across, I trade my map and contact with the Romans for contact with all the other civs.  Sending the galleys into the ocean is the key to my game.  The Great Lighthouse can help the odds of a successful crossing, but my galley made it without the wonder.  <br />
<br />
Another strategy is to crush the Romans with Archers and Hoplites, but with so much open land it seemed a cruel and unnecessary thing to do.<br />
<br />
I doubt I can come close to the top scores, but I never have for any of the other games either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SkyRattlers</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2002, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright so with the knowledge that there was an island of nations that needed to be found you were able to change what normally would have happened. If you had truly been in the dark as I was you wouldn't have even thought about sending suicide galleys. Even a player who is always agressive in any game would more than likely have given up trying to cross that ocean....at it's shortest path it's still something like 10 full ocean squares across.</div></div><hr />
