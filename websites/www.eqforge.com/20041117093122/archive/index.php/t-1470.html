I would like to see just one, tiny, little scenario about the Romulans!

&quot;World War II. The great powers were at one another's throats. Armies clashed across rolling countryside. Air forces sowed death from above. Then, in 1942, everything changed. A new front opened in World War II-when an alien race attacked the Earth...&quot;<br />

Star Trek BAQ is not geared towards the Romulans but neither is it geared towards playing as the Federation - if that is any consolation. Its equal opportunity for Roms, Feds or Klings. Part of the main story line involves the Romulan's sunseed weapon from Diane Duane's Rihannsu series. I released version 2.1 recently, do have a go at it if you haven't already.<br />

I made up a story around the war between the Borg and Species 8472, including the assimilation of the Kazon.<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
I know it seem hard sometimes, but uh...<br />
remember one thing:<br />
through every dark night,<br />
there's a bright day after that,<br />
so no matter how hard it get, stick ya chest out<br />
keep ya head up and handle it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2001, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well...<br />
<br />
It would so happen that I have actually considered such a scenario, but threw it away thinking no one would be interested..I guess I was wrong!<br />
<br />
Anyway, as the story goes&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
I have considered the Romulan episode where the &quot;ROMULAN&quot; Tasha Yar leads the Romulan Empire into a planned conquest of VULCAN to reunify the Romulan-Vulcan people. To do this, you would have to cross into and defeat FEDERATION planets along the NEUTRAL ZONE in order to win. I had thought to make this an objectively scored scenario and as an added factor I thought it would be fun to ally the KLINGONS with the FEDERATION to give them the ability to put up a good fight against the Romulans. <br />
<br />
Well, I'm waiting for feed back on this one...it will actually take some doing, since I have not seen this particular TNG episode in quite some time.<br />

<br />
&quot;Unifacation&quot; parts one and two.<br />
<br />
If I remember right, the Romulans killed their <br />
own men when the plan was exsposed.<br />
<br />
This was more a clandestine attack, as oppossed<br />
to a stright out war.<br />
<br />
As a baseline for a story it is possible,<br />
but to follow the episode would be quite hard <br />
with the civ-2 engine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2001, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...so true, AoA...<br />
<br />
...and I think that was also one of the reasons that I threw it out...basically, you would have depart from the story-line or you would be playing a scenario with a &quot;DestroyACivilization&quot; command in the events...which probably wouldn't be too fun if you were the Romulans.<br />
<br />
...but someone did say to me once that it would be nice to have a scenario about the Klingon-Federation war that never happened...such as by a change in the time-line...<br />
<br />
Any of these ideas seems to require a significant story-line change...I ran into this same probablem trying to make a ST:TMP scenario...I simply had to make it a &quot;What if&quot; scenario that completely departs from the story altogether.<br />
<br />
It's such a challenge, I may still try it...<br />
