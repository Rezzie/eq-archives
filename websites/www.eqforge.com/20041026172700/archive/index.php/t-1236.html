Not in my scenarios... I usually enable the &quot;forbidden tech by conquest&quot; option.<br />

You can give it via scenario editor... what version of Civ2 do you have on your PC?</div></div><hr />

If you do that, will you be able to acquire other tribe's tech when u capture one of their cities?</div></div><hr />

I am looking at other scenarios and I see how a tribe can make specific units.  It looks like you make the unit obsolete for any tribe wich does not have a specific advancement.  I do not understand how to give the advancement to the tribe I want.  Maybe its just the scenario I am looking at.<br />

By giving &quot;Plu, nil,&quot; as prerequisite, you'll be able to forbid other civilizations to research what i called before a &quot;tribal tech&quot;... Maybe this will explain you better... go to    Classic Civilization Home Page (http://web.tiscalinet.it/ClassicCiv)   , the download the Antigonos scenario ( both versions, because graphic files are placed into MGE modpack), then take a look at Rules.txt file. Antigonids and their opponents, thanks to this trick, are able to build a peculiar tribal unit: <br />
Antigonids) Flamethrower<br />
Seleucids) Elephants<br />
Tolemaics) cheapest ships<br />
Lisimacids) Thracian light infantry... and so on.<br />
Not to be mentioned that, by acting this way, you can create historical figures also ( but i don't want to waste the surprise; just download it &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/smilies/cwm30.gif&quot; border=0&gt; ).<br />

I was playing another sceanrio and I noticed if you do not set up the advancements correctly another tribe may offer an advance you do not want to receive.  The cival war for ex:  the french might offer you union, but you are the conferates.  If you are the conferderates you do not want union.  It could screw up all of your specialty units.<br />
I have been looking at Captain Nemo's scenarios.  He created advancements of NON-Union and Non-confed.  This way if you have non-Confed, you can't reasearch union. This way yo will only have confed units<br />

Of course, if you trade opposite techs, you can be in danger. A &quot;Double lock key&quot; like the kind used by Nemo might be a good solution, too...how can explain better? Let's try this...<br />
<br />
Example: a Persians units. Prerequisite, &quot;Persians&quot;; obsolete, &quot;Non Persians&quot;.<br />
<br />
There's a negative factor too. If you use too many double lock techs, you'll have to sacrifice a lot of regular techs, not only extras, so the game can crash. It's a lot useful if there are only two tribes, or if several tribes have the same kind of units ( i.e. the phalanx for hellenistic kingdoms ). You are free to use that technique, but you have to be carefull. Civ 2 codes are unpredictable...</div></div><hr />

I wanted to give the aliens all new air land and sea units.  I have been playing with the editor and I am getting the hang of it.  I am not sure if I should keep working on it because there are so many WWII scenarios out there all ready.  Although this is more of an alternate history/Fantasy.<br />
This is the intro to the Scebnario I am working on, Let me know what you think:<br />
<br />
In Spring of 1941, while World War II raged across the Earth Alien creatures have landed. The Aliens are know as the Race. They are very short Lizard like creatures with pointy snouts and stand about 3 feet tall, which is why they refer to humans as the &quot;Big Uglies.&quot; The Race first arrived on earth in 3500 B.C.  It was decided by the Emporer, the Earth or Tosev 3 as the Race calls it, was a suitable place for a new colony.  The Race, armed with their advanced weapons and superior techchnology, would easily defeat the &quot;Big Uglies&quot;, which inhabited Tosev 3. As the invasion fleet landed on earth, <br />
Avatar, the invasion fleet lord was astonished by how quickly the Big Uglies had advanced in technology. In the society of the Race, advancement was very slow.  To the Race 5500 years was no time at all.  <br />
Avatar and the rest of the invasion fleet had expected the Big Uglies to be using very primitive weapons. Such as Riding on horseback, using spears, bows with arrows and swords as their primary weapons.  When <br />
Avatar saw the Big Uglies flying in planes and piloting Tanks he could not believe his eyes!  &quot;By the <br />
Emporer!&quot; Avatar said, &quot;even though the planes were not jets they were still planes!&quot;  Even with these <br />
new developments, Avatar secured the Race's claw hold on Tosev 3 very easily.  Now the Big Uglies refused<br />
to submit to the will of the Emporer! &quot;We must insalve these big Uglies&quot;, Avatar vowed, for the Colonization fleet is on its way!  We must subdue this planet before they arrive!  <br />
All of the powers of earth are at Peace or cease fire.  If the humans do not band together the Race shall surely take over the planet! <br />

It is wriiten by Harry Turtledove.  There are about 6 books in the series.  He also wrote &quot;Guns of the South.&quot;  Time travelors send AK47's to help the south win.  It's a good series as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prometeus</div><div class="date">Dec 09, 2000, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">JValdez, it's not a MGE command... what i call double lock key are a couple of tech interdicting each other, used as prerequisite for tribe units; so it's placed in rules.txt.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
This is the shape i call simple key...<br />
<br />
In an hypotetic Greek Bactriane scenario<br />
<br />
all greek units --- prerequisite, Greeks, obsolete, Indians<br />
<br />
all indian units --- prerequisite, Indians, obsolete, Greeks<br />
<br />
Of course, this way it's more easy to take forbidden techs by espionage or diplomacy..<br />
<br />
This is the double lock key shape:http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/spinsmile.gif<br />
<br />
all greek units, prerequisite, Greeks, obsolete, non Greeks<br />
<br />
all Indian units, prerequisite, Indians, obsolete, non Indians<br />
<br />
where greeks have non Indians and Indians have non Greeks techs. This way is more difficult to exchange or trade the forbidden tech.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civ2Veteran</div><div class="date">Dec 09, 2000, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the techniques in the game's manual for creating units that are specific to one civ is to change a technology name to &quot;Special Technology&quot;, give it to the target civ(s) only with the scenario editor, and then change the prerequisite advances for that &quot;special technology&quot; to &quot;no,no&quot;.  <br />
<br />
There are two ways to use the &quot;special technology&quot; for the target civ's unique units.  <br />
<br />
The most obvious is to make the &quot;special technology&quot; the prerequisite advance for the civ specific unit, for example, musketeers require gunpowder.  The problem with this is that anyone who obtains the technology can build the unit.  One way to avoid this is to give the civ's that you don't want to build the special unit another &quot;special technology&quot; that makes that specific unit obsolete.  <br />
<br />
Another way to do this is to cause the special unit to become obsolete when someone obtains the &quot;special technology&quot; (which is why trading technology in scenarios can cause some or all of your units to become unavailable to build) and then everyone but the target civ for whom the special unit is for is given the technology.  Then you can have a &quot;normal&quot; technology be the prerequisite for the unit in question.  (remember to give the &quot;Special Technology&quot;, or whatever you call it, to the desired civs BEFORE you change the requisite advances for the special technology to &quot;no,no&quot; or it will not be possible to give the tech to anyone with the scenario editor)  <br />
<br />
If all else fails, you can always read the section of the manual on scenario building. <br />

When I was making my Heroes scenario, there were 4 civ's(Behemoths, Angels, Devils and Titans).<br />
Each one has is own tech tree. The first tech to research was:<br />
Angels - Angelism<br />
Devils - Devilism<br />
Behemoths - Behemothism<br />
Titans - Titanism<br />
and as the tech tree evolves, the new units are available.<br />
I did that (give the tech to respective civ with scen editor and then set the preq to No,No), but then the next tech (that comes from ex.:Angelism) becomes into a No,No tech too, so its owner (in this case the angels) can't research it.<br />
<br />
How can I fix this?<br />

it didn't work<br />
i've read some articles in the Apolyton Scenario League, and it was wrote there that you can do a No,No tech, but you can't directly create improvements or units from it. You must create a (your tech symbol),nil tech from that one with No,No. then you create (four in my case) techs coming from that ***,nil tech and from those tech u make an individual tree tech to each civ.<br />
