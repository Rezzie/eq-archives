</FONT><HR>Thorny Vine, nah, I just started planning the earning of my Ivy-Etched.  I'll probably want to earn my Thorny Vine and Tolans as well if the time ever comes.  <P>If I ever get to the point where I'll pay someone RL cash to achieve goals in a computer game, I will have declared that I am an incompetent loser beyond all redemption.  <P>Reminds me of the trophy "hunters" who pay professional hunters to take them on real live hunts so they can bag themselves a dangerous kill.  Of course they never check the ballistics on the kill shot to see if it was their bullet that killed the beast.<P>Where is the challenge or the skill in following people around and having them kill the beast so you can loot it.  <P>Sometimes we do it in EQ as it is, I did recently for the Short Sword of Morin, a friend of mine kiled the GM and let me know where it was.  In turn, down the road, I'll have to do this for a friend who wants the SSOM when I can solo the GM.<P>EQ-Kevinm If you put out a service and people wilingly buy it, you are providing a service and legitimately making a profit.  Big deal, so are the tobacco and alcohol corporations.  Do the advertising for your service where its welcome.  The members here seem to overwhelmingly not want to use your service.<P>Bye<P>------------------<BR>Micheall<BR>Ranger, 23rd Season<BR>Grandmaster Fletcher<BR>Rallos Zek, Charlie Mike Ranger<BR>No Tears</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://eqforge.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=60&topic=205782.cgi&ReplyNum=000043&forum=Ranger:+General&TopicSubject=Attn.+Sol+Ro+|AMP|+Povar+Rangers,+need+some+thorny+vine|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#B0B08A">

</FONT><HR>Okay... Kevin said that he's from Mithaniel Marr.  I play on that server too (I sometimes hate the fact that I do... I'm not entirely surprised someone thought up UberYou on Mith, we have a LOT of greedy and stuck up PGers on the server).  Anyway, any of you snoops out there, the Uberest guild on Mith is Afterlife, and I've had pretty nasty experiences with some of them.  Some of the guys are alright, like free GG's.  But then some are asses.  There's also the new guild, Cats in Hats.. But that guild doesn't have 15 level 60s like Afterlife does.  Well, whatver.

</FONT><HR>Hi.<P>Get over yourselves people.<P>Bunch of darn hypocrits. <P>A very well known and respected Ranger is selling his Ranger on eBay, to lamenting and messages of how he'll be missed... the nature of this transaction is in essence no different from the service EQ-Kevin is offering.<P>If the chap had any decency and was quitting the game he'd be giving the equipment away to in game friends.<P>One is selling a charcter and equipment he aquired in game for RL cash, the other is selling in game services for RL cash.<P>It's a tricky issue on one hand we have the introduction of RL wealth as a determining factor to ones standing in game.<P>Although it could be said that the amount of free-time one has to play EQ is influenced by this factor anyway.<P>Either way selling in game service is no different than selling on eBay... personally I think it's pretty lame, but certainly not deserving of quite the level of vitriol witnessed here.<P>If EQ-Kevin is so lame, how lame is somebody who rather than keep the mechanics and experience of the game intact and pass his gear to fellow Ranger friends, sells it for cash?<P>Ohhh but it's the Rangers property to dispose of how he sees fit... well it's EQ-Kevin's ingame time to dispose of how he sees fit... selling ones ingame property for out of game cash / selling ones ingame time for out of game cash.... both lame... but hey it is their time and money.<P>------------------<BR>Walk with Tunare<BR>   Ranger Carnagh Sidhe<BR>   (Retired)</FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://eqforge.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=60&topic=205782.cgi&ReplyNum=000067&forum=Ranger:+General&TopicSubject=Attn.+Sol+Ro+|AMP|+Povar+Rangers,+need+some+thorny+vine|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#B0B08A">

</FONT><HR>That really bites.  These guys take up the plane raids for their paying customers to the exclusion of all else.  If we could find out the details, we could arrange for several honest guilds to also hit the planes those nights, and petition for the 'Play Nice' rules to be in effect.  Camp it so hard they wouldn't be able to fulfill their agreements.<P>BTW, if all this is so nice and above board, why does it have to be 'Confidential'???<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://eqforge.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=60&topic=205782.cgi&ReplyNum=000071&forum=Ranger:+General&TopicSubject=Attn.+Sol+Ro+|AMP|+Povar+Rangers,+need+some+thorny+vine|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr><tr bgcolor="#CCCC99">

</FONT><HR>Hahahaha,<P>This has to be the dumbest thread I ever read. First of all I want to congratulate UberYou for their imagination in running this scam.<P>Here are my opinions on this:<BR>- Umm, this is a game. If you say that some perfectly good equipment is going to waste on the planes, why don't you just advertise for certain classes that are missing before you go on the planes. Then invite them to come along for free. Wow, what a novel concept. I sometimes play a druid and when I am about to TP somewhere I always offer the TP to everyone in the zone - for free! It's the same idea.<P>- Secondly, if this is "normal" for this game why didn't Verant have two fees systems. The regular $10/month fee and the $25/month fee where Verant instantly gives you items every month for free. Verant gives you a shopping list at the end of each month based on your level and you pick the items you want. This is pretty much what you are offering and something Verant can supply at a much better rate. Oh wait, Verant has some morals. Imagine that.<P>- Then you say this doesn't hurt anybody. Unfortunately this is absolutely true. Basically I agree that offering this service really doesn't hurt anybody. As long as EVERYBODY who is over 46th gets the same play time on the planes. That means everyone even those not paying your fees.<P>- I personnally this is a morally bankrupt offer, much like a lot of things in RL. Yes certain people in RL are unprofessional and offer better service to those with more money. It is the capitalist way. And yes this happens in RL sports games as well (humm, who will buy the Penant this year). Still doesn't make it right.<P>Solution - Verant should put a cap on the number of times each 46+ player can visit the planes in a given month. Not a very popular decision, but the only way I see this being fixed permanently. Like Kevin said, he is legally in the clear (I hate Lawyers).<P>Longetalos<P>------------------<BR></FONT><P align=right><FONT SIZE="1" color="#000000" face="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica">IP: <A HREF="http://eqforge.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=getip&number=60&topic=205782.cgi&ReplyNum=000073&forum=Ranger:+General&TopicSubject=Attn.+Sol+Ro+|AMP|+Povar+Rangers,+need+some+thorny+vine|QUS|">Logged</A></font></P></td></tr></table></td></tr></table> <table border=0 width="95%"><TR><TD valign=top align=left><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"><br>This topic is 2 pages long:&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqforge.com/forums/Forum60/HTML/205782-.html"></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://eqforge.com/forums/Forum60/HTML/205782.html">1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;<P>All times are EST(US)</FONT></td><td align=right valign=top><FONT SIZE="1" FACE="Arial, Verdana, Helvetica"><A HREF="http://eqforge.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum60&number=60&thisthread=205782&go=newer"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next newest topic.">next newest topic</ACRONYM></A> | <A HREF="http://eqforge.com/cgi-bin/ubbmisc.cgi?action=findthread&forum=Forum60&number=60&thisthread=205782&go=older"><ACRONYM TITLE="Go to the next oldest topic.">next oldest topic</ACRONYM></A></font></td></tr>
