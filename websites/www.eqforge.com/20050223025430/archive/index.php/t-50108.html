2100 - Discover Monarchy. Oedo year = 2050bc so.... REVOLUTION! Offered currancy, HBR, Lit and Maps. I was tempted to go for maps, but decided on currancy as a stepping stone to trade, caravans and MP.<br />

2050 - &quot;All Hail Queen Jayne!!&quot;:queen:<br />
Set tax to 70 Science. Still making €6 per turn and 6 turns per tech.<br />
Ellie finds the end of our island and spots a new island next to where I thought I could see land.<br />

We need science polls and build polls. I'll play Monday or Tuesday.</div></div><hr />

I can't think of anything FA related to talk about - Just keep exploring east with the warrior.  Ellie really can't do much exploration wise, so just let here return to the homeland.</div></div><hr />

We are doing well so far and the future looks bright with a large piece of good land to expand on. Can't think of anything at the moment I'd like to change :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Apr 11, 2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Queen, the last we saw of our Director puglover, he was mumbling something about  working on phase shifting and parallel dimensions.  Our fear is that he has been dabbling in magic as no one in the Office of Scientific Research has the slightest idea what any of those words mean.  In his absence, I have posted a poll to the populace to guage their interest in several potential projects we have been looking at.  Our resources are slim, so we think it best to choose only one for our focus. <br />

Deputy Science Advisor and very non-Magical Creature, Leowind</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW Berlin has gotten captured by barbarians. :lol: <br />
You havn't reported the Germans getting destroyed by them have you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Apr 14, 2003, 03:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Leowind, thanks for seeing the need to take over from puglover whilst he is playing with his magical potions.<br />
<br />
Zelig, I'm sure I posted it, but the Germans where destroyed by the Barbarians very early in the game, and it appears they were re-incarnated as the French. The sad thing is, the Barbs have a city in the top 5, and late-starters the French have a city in the top 5, but we don't.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure that will change:) <br />
The reason is that we more unhappy citizens in RF, although it's covered by an elvis. It comes second if we hire another Elvis:)</div></div><hr />
