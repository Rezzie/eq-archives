<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's starting to get confusing to refer to our cities by descriptions like &quot;NN on the continent west of our main continent&quot; or &quot;NN on the Zulu/Aztec continent&quot; so it seems establishing provincial borders and province names would make sense.<br />
<br />
If we can get governors too that would be great but I doubt this will happen - the level of participation is already low, perhaps dangerously so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, we should probably name the islands we refer to with appropriate names to make it easier, but I doubt governors.<br />
<br />
Some propositions:<br />
Core / The core - western main continent<br />
<br />
Each civs main area the name of the civs country. China, India, Greece and France. Zulus and Aztecs are hard to do this with. Maybe Africa and America?<br />
<br />
Western Island and eastern main continent probably should have made up names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The MoDA refuses to approve province names like &quot;Core&quot; or &quot;The Core&quot; unless the word &quot;sucks&quot; appears somewhere because otherwise this reminds one of the infamous Core ad :D and could look as if we are honoring it. Also we should not name continents that rightfully belong to us China, India etc. I suggest that at the moment we only name provinces where we have established a presence:<br />
<br />
Coresux Province: Our entire main continent<br />
Blenheim Province: The Aztec land, including what's currently occupied by the Aztecs but that rightfully belongs to us :satan:.<br />
Jayne province: The island/continent west of Coresux<br />
Barbarian Province: Our barb farm.<br />
<br />
I suggest these provincial borders where an entire continent/island is not one province:<br />

<br />
According to the constitution provincial borders must be approved by a council vote.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will we be renaming RF to &quot;Electrical&quot; and LP to &quot;Superstorms&quot;? :lol:</div></div><hr />

Will we be renaming RF to &quot;Electrical&quot; and LP to &quot;Superstorms&quot;? :lol: No, but these are great names that we should use for two of the cities we are about to found (seriously !).<br />
<br />
I agree that Jayneland is a better name than Jayne Province and maybe we should use &quot;Blenheim&quot; instead of &quot;Blenheim Province&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2003, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like Jayneland :)<br />
<br />
Perhaps for &quot;Blenheim&quot; you could use &quot;Woodstock&quot; which is the Oxfordshire village that Blenheim Palace was built in.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps for &quot;Blenheim&quot; you could use &quot;Woodstock&quot; which is the Oxfordshire village that Blenheim Palace was built in.  That area is kind of hilly...we could just call it &quot;The Cotswolds&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2003, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like Woodstock, it's a well known name. Now we have managed to shorten the names by getting rid of &quot;Province&quot; from the names. The exception is &quot;Barbarian Province&quot; - maybe we could call it &quot;Barbaria&quot; ?!<br />
<br />
In that case the names would be:<br />
<br />
Coresux<br />
Jayneland<br />
Woodstock<br />
Barbaria</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2003, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, these names speak for themselves, and the sound a lot better than The core.:goodjob:  I really like Barbaria.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2003, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I now like all of the names and have already started using them. However, they are not official because according to the constitution they must be decided/approved by a council vote (and since this is my first democracy game I don't know much about that kind of stuff).</div></div><hr />
