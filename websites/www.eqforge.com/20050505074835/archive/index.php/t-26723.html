<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jabah</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the right-click 'save file as..' in my navigator (Netscape 4.76) I have a 79ko SAV file which causes my Civ3 (patched-1.21) to crash with a 'non valid SAV file', apparently the file gets corrupted during download.<br />
<br />
I know that i had this problem quite often before and AFAIR, the GOTMs teams used to give us both a SAV and a ZIP file which was perfect for me  since ZIP file were not corrupted during transfer (and integrity easier to check at work:)).<br />
<br />
Could someone either post the ZIP file or email me a valid SAV or ZIP file (gouesse@noos.fr) so I could start the GOTM09.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

PS - If someone know why I have this download problems, solutions are welcome too...</div></div><hr />

So zipping the file won't help much. Luckily phillippe's here to help you. ;)<br />
<br />
This may sound harsh, but the problem's on your side. If you can't download files uncorrupted then that's a fault of your browser or modem. http://www.straland.com/images/smilies/undecided.gif</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gunning1</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did. I think that it just isn't going to work. I tried it about 5 times and it still hasn't worked. I guess I just won't get to play. I also tried #7 and it said the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jabah</div><div class="date">Jul 09, 2002, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First thank you philippe for the file (it works fine and I played until 4am yesterday...).<br />
<br />
What happened (apparently) is that the file was a few octets too big (78.9ko instead of 77.8ko), I guess the navigator add some rubish / file declarations the file before the beginning (I notice that sometimes when I download text (TXT) file).<br />
<br />
I just try to download it now with 'download accelerator' (freeware/shareware/demo version that i use for big files or crappy servers) instead of the 'save as...' of the navigator and I get the 'good size' file.<br />
<br />
So if you can't download the correct file with your browser, try it with a downloading program.<br />
<br />
Hope it will help.<br />

PS - Why it is not working in the first place is still a mystery...:confused:</div></div><hr />
