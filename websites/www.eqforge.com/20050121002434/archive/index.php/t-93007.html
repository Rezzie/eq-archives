<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ayleim</div><div class="date">Jul 04, 2004, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">... because Stardock is thinking of buying over the rights to the game from Atari. They have a poll up on their webpage at www.galciv.com, and would seriously consider it if the poll indicates that enough people (&gt;5000) would pre-order the game online.<br />
<br />
For those who have never heard of Stardock, they were the ones who made the game Galactic Civilizations (GalCiv). It's basically a Master of Orion 3 done right. It has a non-cheating AI that still manages to kick butt, which is quite an achievement. Also, they are still supporting GalCiv with numerous mods and improvements even though it is a 2 year old game. GalCiv is an excellent game, and I would trust them to do justice to a MoM sequel.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, you have to register (for free) at the website before you can vote on the poll. You can also go to the forum there, where there are a couple of threads about this subject.<br />
<br />
Sorry for advertising a (sorta) non-Civ-related game here, but some of us are DESPERATE for a MoM sequel to be made after all these years. Also, if anyone here would be so kind as to help spread the word, it would be greatly appreciated.  :D <br />
