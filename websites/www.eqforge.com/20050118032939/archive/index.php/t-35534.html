<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mordhiem</div><div class="date">Nov 01, 2002, 09:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm having some trouble freeing up memory in DOS to run some old games of mine and since I don't have memmaker for some strange reason I am on the lookout for QEMM. The only problem is that it seems to have dissapeared off the face of the earth, all I can get is a review of the '97 version in Japanese :mad:. Anybody know where I can get a copy? Shareware or Full version I don't mind, I just really want to get FPSF:Pro '95 working!!!</div></div><hr />

It helped a lot, especially for finding Qemm 97 :)</div></div><hr />

I've found a couple of old DOS/Windows information, and only in Japanese. :) Fortunately, I can understand it with the help of a dictionary. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did find a warez site (shhhhh!) but the d/l link was broken :mad:.</div></div><hr />

It had compatibility problems with some programs and memmaker worker reliable even if it did not make quite as much memory available.<br />
<br />
It might be easier to just find memmaker and might save some grief too.</div></div><hr />
