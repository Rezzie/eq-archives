<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cruise</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2002, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok i explained some of this in the spoiler thread. I played some more turns and i am sure of this being bugged.<br />
I took over or destroyed all Japanese cities, but they are not dead yet. They have some galleys moving around, and that's it.<br />
<br />
I got to talk to them after a while, and i got their world map, but there's no Japanese city on it. Then a few turns later one of their old cities reverted back to them... and it immediately showed as being the capital. I took the city back and still they appear to be alive.<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen this happen before? What can i do about it apart from abandoning all my conquered cities?</div></div><hr />

You won't get a culture flip until they actually build a city. The downside is that they could float around for even a thousand years.<br />

OT:  I take it this thread is technically not a spoiler?  (If so, I'm a naughty boy :D None of the 355 spoiler views are mine BTW! )</div></div><hr />

Although Eek said he had a culture flip.... Very strange!  Maybe they'd built a capital before that?  :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
That did the trick, i just sunk one of their galleys, and that was the end of them :cool:<br />
<br />
As of for the spoiler factor in this thread, it's around 0.0 or so :p</div></div><hr />

I've faced this problem many times but never had a city flip when the other civ did not have a city. Guess I've just been lucky but I thought that the distance from the capitol played a part in the culture flip calculation. Maybe it's one of those 'spearman defeats tank' type probablities.<br />

This confirms my suspicions as it has been raised in other threads. Release 1.21 has changed the culture aspects of a captured city:<br />
<br />
1. If a city is recaptured by it's original owner its cultural borders will revert back to their orginal position. This means your cultural boundaries get pushed back again even if the cities cultural improvements are distroyed (most likely after several battles).<br />
<br />
2. A city can revert back to its former owner regardless of that Civ's cultural boundary. The odds calculation seems to have remained the same (except say the distance from capital as shown above) but the rule based on how many of your cities 24 tiles radius are owned by its original CIV has been dropped for captured cities.<br />
<br />
As Eek has shown, a very frustrating 'feature' which when attacking a much stronger 'cultured' CIV lends itself to 'raise and regrow' strategy<br />
:die:</div></div><hr />
