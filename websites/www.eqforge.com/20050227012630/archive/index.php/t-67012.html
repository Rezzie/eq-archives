I stopped here because we are now able to build Superhighways and Offshore platforms, and I'd like to know which one we should prioritize, and where? Dou obviously got one, and RF get one next turn.<br />
<br />
We get 2 techs per turn, 1 from science and the other from trade. We also get all of our money surplus from trade. Shall we change tax rates? Lower lux? Our cities are growing just fine, so I'd suggest keeping the lux rate. It appears we'd be able to lower science again and still keep 1 turn/tech, after SH in Dou.<br />
<br />
I've tried warring against the Aztecs and wanted to have a go at the indians, but they just want peace.:( Maybe we should just skip demo and go into fundy? Wait until we have all the techs we need? What about Karachi?<br />
<br />
We're researching MW now, where next?<br />
<br />
BF is a good city, but building the RR will take long. A shortcut would be to found a city west of it and build a transport, or transfer the current one in Rouen to it?<br />
<br />
Since we're not likely to war much in demo, a suggestion is to skip WS, let the indians have it, and get SETI immediately?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Nov 22, 2003, 10:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Game On!<br />
<br />
funxus and I are going to tag-team this game to completion.<br />
<br />
A round of turns will be done once at least once a week.<br />
<br />
At this point, we have had no citizens participate for quite awhile. :(<br />
<br />
If you would like to participate, even by playing a round of turns, let us know.<br />
<br />
I will be playing a round of turns today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Nov 23, 2003, 07:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go ahead then! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Updates thus far:<br />
<br />
I have thrown units into the faces of all the Civs, both military and non-military.  Only a French Crusader took the bait so far and attacked.  Our Destroyer then popped their lone pikeman and we took their last city.<br />
<br />
Freight deliveries around the world give us enough to get 2 techs per turn.  We get the ability to build howizters, which we may need soon since the Indians are currently researching Conscription.  After a few turns of that, the tax rate is switched to 70% income, 0% science, 30% luxuries.  One lone scientist is left to rollover our tech from freight deliveries.<br />
<br />
Rush buys are done around the world.</div></div><hr />
