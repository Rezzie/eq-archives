native americans my foot...<br />
<br />
i think the United States of America should be a civ, because it is undeniably the beest modern civilization on this world.  no, i am sorry to say, it is not sweden.  no offence or anything.  how high is your income tax there?  do your parents even work.  can you even own guns?  i hate socialist tpes of governments.  sweden especially is extreme left on the political spectrum.<br />
<br />
btw, is anyone here mormon?  they would disagree about vanilla's views on native americans.  whts up with their casinos anyway?  <br />

The &quot;Europeans,&quot; or the &quot;English,&quot; (depending on what civs are in your game) sailed across the ocean and established a city or two on a new continent and subdued the technologically-challenged indigenous civilization(s).<br />
<br />
One could, however, play as the &quot;Americans,&quot; and simply change the leader's name from Abe Lincoln to some great Native American chief, and rewrite history!<br />

I think that it is arrogant to think that the US is the most powerful country in the world when we would most likely not stand a chance in a conventional war against China. In a nuclear war, we would win, but then again, win what?<br />
<br />
Also, the United States the most superior consumer but not necessarily the best trader in actual production.<br />
<br />
The United States is a great invester in new companies and is one of the greatest economic powers for that reason.<br />
<br />
As far as playing a specific civ, the first time I ever played civ, I was disappointed to find out that when it said &quot;Indians&quot; it meant Asian, because I am Native American. I have played the Souix but they are not my tribal background, so if I want to play a game with Native Americans...I will just have to write one. There are some good modpacks out there...Sacrificial Blood is one, but that is MesoAmerican...<br />
<br />
I am currently writing an upgrade that doesn't have any of the &quot;regular&quot; listed civs but all the others that I think have rich histories that would be fun to play....including Sweden!<br />

I visited Stockholm in 1993 on a self-created 6-city 12-day N.European tour (in mid-Jan ... COLD!).  Of my visits to Helsinki, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Paris, Brugge, and Amsterdam,  Stockholm was my fave city and best experience.  The Vasa museum was so incredible! <br />
<br />
FOR ANYONE INTERESTED: The Vasa was the Swedish military version of the Titanic - military strategists here might like it ... I just wouldn't recommend building a unit like this!  Though it might be fun ... JohnV?  They have a website ... lemme find it here .... http://www.vasamuseet.se/ <br />
<br />
Anyway, my point is: from my Swedish experience, the first time I ever played Civ (probably '96), I chose Vikings, and while I'm currently getting around and trying other civs, Vikings are probably still my fave.<br />

The only problem with them is that they're libel to have to put up with the mindless Mongols, who limit your expansion by butting in on your territory and taking undefended cities by breaking treaty.<br />

If you use the standard starting positions, you will only have one or two civs on the same continent with you, which you can destroy quickly within the first few turns. Plus the civs on the Euro/Asia are usually too busy exploring their own continent to come bother you, at least not until you have established a considerable lead in knowledge and technology. Also, no civ has South America as an intitial starting position so you have all that land available for development w/o opposition. Plus the twin rivers in the Central U.S. make an excellent spot for a knowledge/science city.<br />
<br />
As far as city names, I typically use references from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.  Nine books gives you a lot of characters, places, etc. to use names from.<br />

And LordMorn, I figure we're not talking about randomly generated maps if you've reliably got separate continents.<br />
<br />
Am I asking this question because I've never bothered to select a specific map/scenario first?<br />
<br />
Help, and mercy, appreciated.<br />

<br />
Recently I've been playing ALL of my games on a small, random map, with lots of land, archipelago, temperate, average, 3 biillion years old. THIS HAS ALWAYS GIVEN ME TWO SETTLERS TO BEGIN WITH! The small map lets you meet every other tribe almost right away.<br />

There is a point in the startup where you can choose the map you play on, and I usually play on that one.<br />
<br />
  It's really just a matter of personal preference/choice. I have played on random maps before and have had an equal blast with those... I just like the large-size Earth map because I like the long-drawn-out endgame and I find it makes for excellent high scores under the particular strategy I use. <br />

Just putting my $.02 into the discussion.<br />

I think that as far as the game goes the difference is the size of the individual land mass. Archipelagoes have a number of small land masses while a continent is one or two large land masses.<br />

     My original MSN Gaming Zone id was Uruk_the_Great which I named because I read that Uruk is the first known named city, so I usually played the Babylonians.  I have also created a custom Civ with city names included, the Scottish (I used the city names from the Scottish Civ in CTP) by editing both my rules.txt and my city.txt file.  Unfortunately, in multiplayer games the city names that I put in my city.txt file don't show up unless I am host and even then the Civilization nameshows up as the Indians (that's who I overwrote) for some and Scotts for others.  I hope they make this better in Civilization III.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">infoman</div><div class="date">May 16, 2001, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have played most of the civs. In the end I usually play either the Americans, Germans, English, Romans, or Japanese. The main reason I end up playing these is because my best games have come playing as one of these civs. I must be stuck on using only one type of strategy not to use the others that often. I gennerally name my leaders after famous generals/leaders from history(Rommell,Cesear Augustus, Wellington, Cromwell, Guderian, Montgomery, Patton, Robert E. Lee, J.E.B. Stuart) I realize many of these generals are from the WWII era. <br />
<br />
Whatever civ anyone plays is based on what you like not necessarily from where you are from.<br />
