<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, normally on NT/2K, the net send function can only use the message service of microsoft windows to send messages through LAN, right?<br />
Yesterday I received a popup message from that MS service originating from... the net! It was of course a spam ad, but well now it seems to be a new kind of spam, after email spam. How can they do that? My question is does it exist such a tool, a Netsend that works even over the internet (using IP addressing then), and not only over LAN (using computer nickname)?<br />
<br />
It seems very strange but the message type is exactly the netsend message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">can you give a screen capture of it? Without seeeing it I would guess that you either executed a program that was in the email or you have a trojan on your computer. There should be no way for the comman net to be used outside of your domain (so, maybe it is someone on the same domain of your DSL ISP!!). Fry the bastard. ;)<br />
<br />
Do, net view and see if you see other people on your domain. Do  net send /domain to send a message to the whole domain and net send computer_name to send to a particular computer. (there is a space between the send and computer_name</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't screenshot it. Just got it once...<br />
But it showed the sender IP. Forgot to note it down. blabla message from ... exactly like for netsend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">was it an actual DOS window or was it a Windows Window made to look like a DOS window?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's of course a Windows window! what a strange question. Just net send to yourself a message and you got the pic. It's a dialog box with the text in it and the classic ok button...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, I just love this language barrier.<br />
<br />
If you are not willing to take the time to send a screen shot, I am not going to help you, French Fry!!! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 12, 2002, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A windows that would look that way :p<br />
Not that hard to understand. Plus, my initial question was if anybody knew a (freeware) equivalent of netsend but over the Internet. Not hard to answer ;)</div></div><hr />

:lol:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 18, 2002, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah finally it showed up again, that damn spammer. look: surprising isn't it. An internet net send.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanaz</div><div class="date">Oct 18, 2002, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What does the Task Manager show when this is up?  Couldn't it be a pop-up masquerading as a Net Send?  But they couldn't disquise the process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 19, 2002, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, sanaz, it's a real netsend and to prove it, I had NO active internet explorer opened! It couldn't be a popup. It's a service of messaging as it states... The mystery is still total... Truth is out there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy76</div><div class="date">Oct 19, 2002, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is that person on the same ISP as you? Is there IP very similar to yours?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 20, 2002, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How can I know, the IP on the popup was mine... no way to find out his/her IP...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanaz</div><div class="date">Oct 20, 2002, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What firewall are you running?  Log traffic to port 139 (NetBIOS) from the internet.   This should not be getting through.  There are online port scanners that you can direct back to yourself to see that you are really protected properly.  The reason something like net send is only expected from the local network is that the MS networking are generally locked down from the internet.  However, it's just IP traffic, and will pass across the internet freely.  If you're open to this, you may be vulnerable to other attacks also.  To alleviate this particular symptom, you can disable the Windows Messenger Service.  Do this in the Services Control Panel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 21, 2002, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Found it! at last!!<br />
http://www.itsecure.com.au/news/story.htm?StoryID=254<br />
Here's an article that speaks about direct advertiser, the program they use. Read it, it's frtightening. Using a backdoor in netbios and it simulates a net send over internet. SO I was right, it was really a net send but its functionnality was hijacked by those damn spammers... :mad:<br />
<br />
Btw, http://www.directadvertiser.com/ is the homepage of that software, $700!!! Expensive but well, the spammers bastards will always afford it, grrr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanaz</div><div class="date">Oct 21, 2002, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see they use port 135 - tricky.  I would still recommend locking down ALL MS ports from the internet.  I prefer locking ALL ports other than what I know I want to use, which from home is nothing as I don't run any local servers.  Basically, default to block all traffic and then work forwards from there allowing only what you know you want to be initiated from the public.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 24, 2002, 11:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn, now it's everyday I get it twice :mad: f***<br />
I now set my firewall to total paranoia!</div></div><hr />
