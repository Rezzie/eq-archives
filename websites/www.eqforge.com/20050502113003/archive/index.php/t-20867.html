With this Map/Difficulty Level, I need all the time I can get........or can we just send it when we get finished?........in about 2 months!! :)<br />
<br />

<br />
I can't answer your real question but I am doing my first milk run also. At about the half way point my turns were taking just over an hour each, so I can identify with your concern. However, the last 250 to 200 turns were getting shorter and shorter and my last 100 or so turns were only about 5 minutes each (only 30 more turns to go). I have learned lots from this experience and would not do a milk run in the same manner again.<br />
<br />
Hope you get over the time hump soon, I'm pretty confident you will.<br />

I'd be interested to read your &quot;Milk Run&quot; Strategy Tips in the &quot;Civ3 GOTM 6 Post-Mortem&quot; (viz. Sometime(?) in Early May!!)</div></div><hr />

Well this is my first milking so I would suspect that SirPleb and Aeson are the ones with the most knowledge and experience about this. I have no problem sharing after the close of this contest though. Your post was so  like a question that ran through my mind about a week ago, glad that info was on track for you.<br />

I seem to recall that Aeson spent about 200 hours on the one milking for the HOF, that he lost. I think that the amount of effort that one can put in to a milking can be quite extensive but as you suggest if your under the gun you can whip through to the end pretty quick.<br />

What about mine? (Get my email of the game?) I was able to play a few more turns (got a few more Persian cities - hehe.. they enjoy declaring war on me and losing one &quot;front&quot; - row... er, column of cities). Got one during the UU Wars, WWI (1864-1880) and WWII (1908-1950+). Anyway, mine is now &quot;sticking&quot; for 30 minutes to even 2 hours in some cases! (I have 128 Megs of RAM)... But, the sound effects still work right.... At this rate, it won't be done until November!</div></div><hr />
