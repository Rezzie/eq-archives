<br />
In Fact I think Alex wants to date Cathrine or something....<br />
<br />
there's 3 possible deals I found, all good.<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads4/GreeceDeal1.jpg<br />
<br />
While slightly more expensive it's mostly a GPT trade which helps lessen the immediate impact...<br />
<br />
 http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads4/GreeceDeal2.jpg<br />
<br />
Though at the same time we can Easily get Mapmaking from Cathrine just for giving her some of the numerous techs we have over her. So if we reduce it to just giving Alex Catherine's Phone number he offers to give us alot more.  I think the best way is to give Catherine 2 of our techs (or whatever) to get her mapmaking, then take this following deal.<br />

EDIT: 99g is all that's in the Greek Coffers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It also works without either World Map and the Gold, but I figure having Catherine's WM might be nice and I was wary to add in another contact just for fear the more people who know Cathy's phone number the less that number's worth.<br />

<br />
The second deal with greece is immediately out. (deal 2), not enough gain against say the first deal.<br />
<br />
Id go with the deals with catherine and 3rd greece</div></div><hr />

And what does that change? If you're not able to open the demogame save on the Mac 1.29ß2, use the little trick given by Brad Oliver in the second beta page (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=53107&amp;pagenumber=3) down the page.</div></div><hr />

If we're willing to spend the gold, I'd go for the first deal.  I've been waiting for Map Making so that we can get a harbor build once and for all. <br />
<br />
Don't forget the Russian Deal, so long as we're willing to trade away Mathmatics and our WM it's a better deal.  along with the third Greek deal we get Map Making and Philosophy AND a profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 02:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say: first get the Russian technology for our tech and NO contact or World map. Then trade around to get tech parity. Then sell contact for money and maps. <br />
<br />
Don't forget Greece or Aztecs etc. can already have tech we can't see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 04:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This what I have found:<br />
<br />
We give:  Contact with Aztecs, Americans and Egyptians.<br />
<br />
Russia gives:  Map Making, World Map and 178 gold(all of it!)<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, this works great with Greek deal #3(Cathy's phone # for Philosophy etc).  This way, we play ambassador and benefit from making all the contacts.  And we do this all without giving up any gold or World Maps ourselves.  Also, doing this all at once will keep us from worrying about the diminishing value of the contacts.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, I have not called up other civs to see what they will offer to meet Cathy.  I will look into that and give my assessment later today.  If the money is there, we may be able to get the above deal from Russia for a bunch of our techs(we have 4 techs that they don't have).<br />
<br />
As long as we get Russia's World Map, Map Making and a whole lot of gold, I really don't care how we go about it.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would support the first or second deals.  I think we should get both Philosophy and Map Making.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falcon02</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DZ my fear with giving out contacts right on the get go is that when we get to trading Russia's to Greece, Alex won't be so generous since he knows he knows 3 other people with the same contact, making it less valueble.<br />
<br />
<br />
btw, I'm for the Russian deal w/ World Map trades to get Mapmaking, then the third Greek deal to get Philosophy, and then seeing what we can get for the other contacts after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Immortal</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely agree with Falcon here, the less global network that is established, the better our chances of avoiding all out hostilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took a close look at the opportunities and the consequences here. Russia knows no-one. Really no-one except us. Therefore he is behind in techs. <br />
<br />
I think it is wise to trade Russia our techs HBR, lit and Maths for all Russian money (178 gold), Map making and their World map. After that sell contact with the Russians to Greece for Philosophy, WM and 99 Gold. We can then see whether someone has researched beyond what is visible now. If they have, we still have &quot;Contact with the Russians&quot; on sale to America (53 gold) , Azteca (46 gold) and, depending on a decision of war or peace, perhaps Egypt (unknown amount of gold). <br />
<br />
We won't be giving away our WM, so our hinterland is still unknown to them. We are only selling something they'll get very soon either way; Russian contacts. We earn all of their gold. We'll be at tech parity with our known world-sharers and (two options):<br />
<br />
1) War with Egypt: could make Embassies and even sign MA's.<br />
2) Peace with Egypt: have time, money and production (GA) to fill our lands. <br />
<br />
Also note that the Hanging Gardens have been build by Germany, so Monarchy has become slightly cheaper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, Rik.  Thank you for writing this so I didn't have to.   :D<br />
<br />
I have pretty much reached the same conclusions.  It is very  possible for us to clean out our neighbors coffers as outlined above.  This could put our treasury at upwards of 450-500g.  :eek:<br />
<br />
In doing so, we can then consider ending the war with Egypt and raising our science rate.  I really don't want to wait 35 more turns for Polytheism, and with these trades we won't have to.</div></div><hr />

1) the Philo,99, WM cathy deal with Alex<br />
followed by<br />
2) The MM,WM,178g for HBR, Lit, Math deal<br />
and perhaps(hopefully)- Egypt peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2003, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that the Russian and Greek trades should be at the forefront, SaaM.<br />
<br />
Maybe we should poll separately the selling of Russian contact to the Aztecs and the Americans.  As Greece will probably do this if we don't, we should take the opportunity to grab 53g from America and 46g from the Aztecs.<br />
<br />
And maybe we should run another poll regarding our war with Egypt.  While your intentions were good by posting a poll, it still seems to be up in the air(at least to me --- I'm not giving up yet).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2003, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. Peace IS a must. But how?...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2003, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I am going to start by polling these trades in two separate blocks.  Hopefully, this will show people that we don't need this war:<br />
<br />
Greek trade(do this trade first)<br />
<br />
We give:  Contact with the Russians<br />
<br />
Greece gives:  Philosophy, World Map and 99g<br />

<br />
Russian trade<br />
<br />
We give:  Horseback Riding, Literature and Mathematics<br />
<br />
Russia gives:  Map Making, World Map and 178g<br />
