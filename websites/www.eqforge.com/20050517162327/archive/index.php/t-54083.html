<br />
Noshuret:<br />
<br />
Temple, Legion, Legion, settler<br />
<br />
I would like this to be the last settler Noshuret produces for awhile, since its primary purpose is to build legions, which are significantly more expensive than warriors.<br />
<br />
Gorina<br />
<br />
Settler, Temple, Palace prebuild<br />
<br />
I have removed the warrior from the queue because it will actually be a legion, which will take too long.  See the Nar Shadaa queue for more information.<br />
<br />
Nar Shadaa<br />
<br />
warrior,  warrior, worker, warrior<br />
<br />
These two warriors should be sent south to garrison Gorina during its wonder prebuild to avoid unhappiness.  If we decide to try to build a large military, it might be useful to keep this city from being connected to the iron, so that it can build warriors instead of legions.<br />
<br />
Penguinadua<br />
<br />
Granary, settler, settler</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">May 23, 2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I back this plan on 1 condition. <br />
<br />
We currently have 4 workers. With this plan only 1 extra is build. What I think is urgent is that one of our next cities will be mass-producing workers. Given that condition I back this plan. Especially not connecting Nar Shadaa is a nice twitch. If we will not have a proper worker factory soon I want more workers produced in our current cities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't worry.  Nar Shadaa's build queue contains more workers after it finishes what I posted.  For the most part, it will produce one warrior and one worker every 10 turns until another city is founded to build some workers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 23, 2003, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As Mayor of Gorina, I have no problem with the Gorina queue. I welcome the Temple, and am giving way to a Palace pre-build. We seem to be doing quite well technologically, so there MAY be a chance of an early Wonder. Let's see what happens. (I hope we head for Monarchy soon. )<br />
<br />
I'm not sure the Temple in Gorina will be complete before you are ready to start building Legionaries in Noshuret. There might be a timing conflict.<br />
<br />
I also like Nar Shadaa and Penguinadua. Good work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">May 23, 2003, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">good work eyrei, I think these queues are great. I am fine with having a pre-build, but the question is, what wonder shall we build? I also favor the production of legionares as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">May 24, 2003, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only one problem, we can't build legions until the iron is usable :(.  We'll have to either use up a worker on a colony, or wait until 10 turns after Gorina's temple completes.<br />
<br />
Also, is it wise to build a temple in Noshuret now?  If it's necessary for happieness reasons that's understandable, but if not we could build some warriors for upgrade instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Almightyjosh</div><div class="date">May 24, 2003, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that the capital needs only to produce either a temple or a settler.  If we are to reduce the slow growing population by sending some of them out into the wilderness, then we will not need a temple for a LONG time.  If however, we would prefer to keep Noshuret somewhat larger and more productive, then I would say build a temple and then pump out those millitary units.  This is the wiser of the two.<br />

I can't explain it, but something inside (My 'CivSense') tells me that's wrong...<br />

Barring that, everything looks good.</div></div><hr />
