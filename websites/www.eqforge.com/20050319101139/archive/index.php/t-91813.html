<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erik Mesoy</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2004, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently I posted a preview of ENES 6 with some half-formed rules. However, I realized that I had not made an ENES 5 yet! Obviously this HAD to come first. So here we are, with another not-quite-usual NES.<br />
<br />
Those familiar with Neo Nes 7 will recognize the ruleset.<br />
<br />
MONEY:<br />
Represented by Production Points. Each turn you are given a certain amount of PP to spend. These may not be banked.<br />
<br />
INCREASING PP:<br />
1) You can spend 5PP in order to increase your PP income by 1. Say you had 50 pp one turn, spent them all on increasing, then you would have 60 pp to spend the next turn and after that.<br />
2) At certain tech levels or points in the game, resources will be found/noticed in your nation. These provide a PP boost every turn you have them and can be traded away, since you only get the benefit from even if you have several.<br />
3) If you invade another nation, you may pillage PP from them. These are a one-time bonus, appearing as a plus after your PP to spend (meaning that you will not earn that amount next turn unless you continue pillaging.) This is the least dependably method, but the one with the highest possible returns.<br />
<br />
ARMIES AND NAVIES:<br />
An army/navy will be displayed as a number from 1 to 9 on the map. On the first page, it will be referred like this:<br />
1: {3} (1)-(2) [1]<br />
This means that Army 1 has a size of {3}, attack value of (1) and defense value of (2), and a movement rate of [1].<br />
If your army is in your territory, it will be in black. If not, it is in your color.<br />
An army is increased or built by spending 5pp per size level.<br />
Note that armies need tech level 5 to move outside your territory. You need tech level 12 to build navies.<br />
Armies and navies cost 5pp per size level to build (4 if you have the correct trait.)<br />
<br />
EXPANSION:<br />
You territory expands each turn. You can specify which direction main expansion should be in.<br />
<br />
EDUCATION:<br />
Spend 5 PP for one point of education. Certain levels give you bonuses.<br />
Education at 3: You may choose your people's trait. (see below.)<br />
Education 5: Armies may move outside your territory.<br />
Education 10: Your armies gain 1 offense value.<br />
Education 12: You may build navies.<br />
Education 15: Your armies gain 1 defense value.<br />
Education 20: Despotism government (3 armies, 2 navies)<br />
More will be revealed as technology advances. After all, you cannot be quite sure what the future holds.<br />
<br />
TRAITS:<br />
After reaching tech level 3 (rudimentary) you may choose 1 trait.<br />
Scientific: Only need 4 PP per point of education.<br />
Militaristic: Only need 4 PP per point of army.<br />
Seafaring: Only need 4 PP per point of navy, can build navies without needing lvl 12.<br />
Industrious: Only need 4/5ths the amount of PP to build wonders.<br />
<br />
WONDERS:<br />
At certain points of technology, you may begin construction of Wonders. These generally take a lot of time, but give very beneficial effects.<br />
<br />
GOVERNMENTS:<br />
You start out as a Tribal Chiefdom. You are restricted to 2 armies and 1 navy (which may be as large as you like.) Better education will give better governments which will allow more armies and navies.<br />
New government- Despotism- 3 armies, 2 navies- requires 20 tech.<br />
<br />
NOTES AND CLARIFICATIONS<br />
<br />
You can only increase army/navy SIZE. Attack, defense and speed need tech, just like in Civ3. <br />
<br />
THERE WILL BE NO COMMERCIAL TRAIT.<br />
<br />
YOU CANNOT BANK PP.<br />

<br />
@Jason:<br />
Shall I put you down for Mitanni? (NE of egypt IIRC)<br />
Stories give bonuses.<br />
Size does not affect attack or defense. (i.e. you could have 20 1/1 Warriors in civ3, but you would need tech, not more of them, to get swordsmen at 3/2.)<br />
Battle system is fairly much head on. Write a good story with tactics and you get your effective army size multiplied for the battle, simulating the effect of supreme generals to win even when outnumbered 5 to 1.<br />
Terrain will have little effect. For the sake of simplicity, let's pretend that all of Africa is one huge desert.<br />
<br />
@erez: Sorry. I weighed that one and threw it out. That's the same as getting 4 to 1 on ALL areas.<br />

<br />
Abronna, Queen of all South Africa, stood moodily at her bedroom window, staring out over her country. She sighed, and at once her childhood friend, Bevyan was there. &quot;Is there anything wrong, your Highness?&quot; &quot;Bevyan, there's no need for you to call me your Highness. We've known each other since we were small babies. It was just a strange twist of fate that I became Queen. Nobody could have known that brother was poisoned the day my father abdicated for the benefit of my brother, and that he would die just seconds after my father had finished the abdication ritual. And as everybody knows, a ritual done is a ritual done, and nobody can undo what happens at a ritual. So, with my father abdicated, my brother dead, no other sons or brothers, and nobody to marry me off to, I'm Queen of South Africa. My father would probably have found me a rich man to wed, but he also died of poisoning, only a year after his abdication, and two months after I took the throne, and I wonder, Bevyan, I wonder...&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gladinia</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2004, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Narrator:As the years passed, the nation of South Africa flourished under High Queen Abronna's rule. She had done a lot to find the murderers of her only kin, but she had never found them, and after a while her grief abated. <br />
Although she still held an eye out for murderers, her other eye was focused on the wellbeing of the nation. South Africa expanded greatly, and got richer by the minute. On the way they conquered and subdued a great many smaller tribes, and began what would later be called the &quot;Coastal Unifying&quot; and be remembered for many years to come. Most of the tribes were small, and not hard to conquer. One tribe, though, caught the Queens attention, and held it there. Here is an extract from the writings of Andaedd, High Withdoctor under High Queen Abronna.<br />
<br />
An Extract From The Writings Of Andaedd, High Witchdoctor Under High Queen Abronna.<br />
 Today the Queen conquered another fourteen tribes. Most of them submitted to us willingly, having heard of us, wanting to see wonders, and to live safely from other tribes attacking. Only four of the tribes offered resistance, and only one of them had a real army, not just the token resistance that meant &quot;We really want to join you,  but that would mark us as cowards, so now we will &quot;Fight to the death&quot; Please do not kill us, just fight a bit, and then overpower us so that we can come into your fellowship as respected warriors, not cowards who joined you at the sight of some armed men&quot; The last one though, that  was something to write about, and no mistake! The second the tribe saw us, they raced back to their village. That looked like no big problem. The village was probably just a normal village with no defencewoks, since noone could had spread the word of us advancing. Everyone had joined us, so we went in cocky. That was where we went wrong. Everywhere else we had at least sent in scouts, but they looked so scared, so I persuaded the High Queen to just attack, and she listened to me. We were just marching through a small pass when we saw the gates. The village was placed with it's backdoor right up  this pass. The back &quot;walls&quot; were the hill through wich the pass went through. It looked something like this: See attachment one Of course, we went right in. When we were only a bit through, they began throwing down oil and torches. We retreated at once, although to heavy losses. I myself lost a leg to the flame, but that was the spirits punishing me, not just bad luck. The next thing we did was sending out scouts. When they're reports were delivered, things looked grim. Although they only had a small army, they had formidable defences and provisions, and no lack of morale. So half the army settled down to siege, while the other half went further on to conquer. Then something happened. The &quot;Siege half&quot; of the army had been settled for a week now, with regular fishing teams, root/berry etc teams, and water teams. Patrols were everywhere, and scouts. Everything else was also fine. But on that day, the fishing team was unlucky. Here follows an account of the only survivor of that ill-fated fishing trip. <br />
<br />
An account of the fishing trip the fourteenth, by Greldik the sailor.<br />
Well, it was like this, you see. We were fishing where the lookout had seen a load of mackerel, When the waves came up. At first they were only small, but after a wile they  got bigger, and hevier. So we began hedding in towards land, but we cuddn't get in. Then suddenly we saw this great big... well... THING. It leppdd over us and blotted out the sun, so we saw nothing. It landed rite in the middle of the boet, and smashed it. All the others got caugt under it, but I eskaped. I swam to land, and  here I am. The Witsj Dokktor cudd probablii have rittenn a betterr account, but he wasn'tt there.<br />
<br />
More Of The Writings Of Andaedd, High Witch Doctor Under High Queen Abronna<br />
On the sixteenth, we launched an expedition to go find this great sea monster, so tht they could find out what it was, and either kill it or bring it back. Most of the fifteenth had been used to build a great cage, in case of the latter happening, although most of the men doubted that. The sixteenth was, for most of us, a rest day. We put up guards in pairs, incase the &quot;fishers&quot; should get back. The rest slept, ate, diced, bet, (polished their weapons :sad: ) and whatever else a tired army does. Suddenly one of the guards came rushing into my tent, shouting hysterically. &quot;THEY'RE BACK!!! THAY'RE BACK!!!!&quot; &quot;Calm yourself man,&quot; I said. &quot;Now. Just who's back?&quot; &quot;the fishers. They've come back with the monster!&quot; &quot;WHAT!!! THEY'RE BACK!???! WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME AT ONCE!?!!!?!!!?! &quot;Errrrr&quot; That comment was lost on me, as I already was down on the shore. And by all the spirits and their ****, It was a sight to see, I'm telling you. It was just ENORMOUS!!!<br />
@ErikMesoy: I'll let you describe it. See the bottom of the page for more informasjon.<br />
<br />
An Account Of How The Tribe Surrendered To Us, And Of The Council Between The Tribal Chief And Andaedd. Extracted From The Writings Of Andaedd, High Witch Doctor Under High Queen Abronna.<br />
When the tribe saw that we had caged the sea monster, he came out, willing to parley. He told us that his tribe had lived in fear of the monster, wworshipping it and giving it offerings. The tribe had become quite poor, but had built a lot of defenses, so that if anybody attacked, they would just have to hold them off until the sea monster came. As it had happened, We took the sea monster, instead of it taking us, and for that they were grateful. Now they no longer needed to live in fear of it, and they could settle down to a normal life. They agreed to submit to our rule peacefully, but there the council ended, for the sea monster began thrashing about again, and we had to go see to it. The rest of the details got hammered out later, and that is how that matter ended.<br />
<br />

The Kingdom grew faster than ever. The most advanced country in the world. As the country continued to grow the King belived the area is a risky one. Saharan met new neighborse to the east and who knew if they are of good or evil. Maybe even trade could begin with them or will the Saharan people will only see wars and blood from this new neighbore? Only time will tell... In the mean time Saharan learned that those people came by sea from far away lands called Phoenicia that were overrun by aggresive and ruthless empires. Many of the people scaped and created the city of Carthage wich became a new kigndom.<br />
<br />
The Saharans were not much diffrent. They oens lived far far in the south but were peacfull and scientific unlike their many aggresive african neighborse. They were attacked and defeated time after time and pushed northward and northward until all they saw was deserts. In this many deserts the Saharans looked for water. Their highly advanced civilization found ways to discover water rather quicly. As the found a huge source of water much to the North most of the people came to it and created the capital of Saharan, Kariz.<br />
<br />
Kariz was a beautifull city made of sand stone. The way to connect each stone was a revolutionary one as they used mud. When water supplies in Kariz begun to deplet the people begun to go northward to find water and bring it to the capital. As the people begun to migrate they found many more water sources. Villages were built around them and animals begun to carry water to Kariz. but it was not enough. The Saharan people had to find new ways to bring water to the beautifull but dry capital. As they continued looking for more water they discovered coasts into new big seas. They built new villages near every water source but grouth never stopped and forever the Saharan people will look for ways to bring water to Kariz.<br />

<br />
Many, many years ago, the site where Carthage now stood had simply been a minor outpost of the once-mighty Phoenician Empire. Populated mainly by traders, its only business was to exchange Phoenician products for native ones and ship them back to their native land. While many of the commodities were very valuable, little of the wealth ever reached the hands of the people responsible for its acquisition.<br />
<br />
All of that changed, however, after the destruction of Tyre and the subjugation of Sidon by the mighty land of Assyria. During this time of trouble, the Phoenicians lost control of most of their colonies. Faced with imminent doom, the people of these two cities launched a fleet of many ships carrying not soldiers, but citizens and freemen. Many ships were sunk in storms or scattered by the fickle seas, but those that weathered the journey brought their people to the place where they would found Carthage, the &quot;New City.&quot; Since then, Carthage had been the capital of its own empire, growing and expanding in many possible ways.<br />
<br />
Now, they had met the nation of the Saharans, a people who had once dwelled in the unknown southern lands but had been driven out by others. Compared to Carthage the people of this land had less wealth, but they were devoted to understanding the ways and laws that governed the world, and thus had a greater respect for knowledge. Carthage's army was bigger, but the Saharans had the better one. It seemed that these people had good trade potential, despite the fact that they mostly lived in a merciless desert with very few good places to settle. Besides, the fact that they could live in such a harsh environment relatively comfortably indicated that this was a strong and resourceful race.<br />

He turned to a friend. &quot;I have an idea,&quot; he said. &quot;How about every evening after we're done working in the fields, we all hold a rock-hitting competiton to see how far we can hit rocks with a stick?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I dunno,&quot; the second guy said. &quot;Just hitting rocks sounds boring. Maybe if we could find a way to make it a little more exciting...&quot;<br />
<br />
Silence. Then the second guy spoke up. &quot;How about this: We set up two big smooth stones a certain distance apart. One guy hits a rock with the stick and then runs from one stone to the other and back before another guy can find the rock he hit and tag him. How's that sound?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Very interesting,&quot; the first guy answered. &quot;And maybe we could make it to where if the guy is standing on one of the stones, he's safe from tagging.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But then how would he run back?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Simple. Another guy would hit the rock again at the first stone. Then, while the second guy runs to the base stone, the first guy can run back 'home' to the starting stone.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But wouldn't they be in each other's way and get slowed down?&quot; the second guy said. &quot;How would we solve that?&quot;<br />
<br />
A third guy chimed in. &quot;Why not add another base stone? That way, when the second guy runs to the first base, the first guy can run to the second base and then home.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Or better yet,&quot; said a fourth, &quot;make three base stones. That would give the runners a challenge.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would that be a challenge?&quot; asked a fifth. The conversation was beginning to attract others.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah,&quot; yet another assented, &quot;Wouldn't that just give the other guy a harder time trying to tag 'em all?&quot;<br />
<br />
After this point, the whole discussion took on a life of its own, drawing comments like a moth to a flame.<br />
<br />
&quot;Well, we could give the rock-pitcher a few helpers close to the bases, and maybe a few more out in the field, just in case the guy hits a good one.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would we keep track of who's supposed to be what, with this many people involved?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;We could divide everyone into two teams. One team hits, while the other team catches and throws. Then they'd alternate.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;How would we decide what time it is to switch?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Why not assign a point for every time somebody runs around the bases, then rotate after so many points have been scored?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But if guys keep on getting tagged, the game would take forever!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I have a solution for that. Each time a guy gets tagged, his team gets a penalty. After three penalties, the teams switch places.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;What if the guy misses the rock with his stick? Wouldn't that hold up the game?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Easy. If the guy misses three times, his team takes a penalty and has to put up another guy.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But what if there's something wrong with the throw, and it goes too high or too low for the batter to hit?&quot;<br />
<br />
Silence.<br />
<br />
Finally, someone came up with an answer. &quot;Then we give the pitcher a penalty. After so many bad throws, the batter could go ahead to the next base.&quot;<br />
<br />
And so it began. After minutes of discussion, several details were worked out, such as using a leather ball instead of a rock, a bigger bat, how long the game would last, and so forth. Finally, they were ready to start a test game.<br />
<br />
Or rather, they were almost ready.<br />
<br />
A guy went out to look for base stones. He could only find three. There wasn't a stone for home base.<br />
<br />
&quot;What a shame,&quot; one guy said.<br />
<br />
&quot;So much for that idea,&quot; another added.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; said the guy who had come up with the idea. &quot;I'll be right back.&quot; And so he left them for a moment. He came back with a plate from a china set.<br />
<br />
&quot;Where'd you get that?&quot; somebody asked.<br />
<br />
&quot;The master's house.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you CRAZY!?! You're going to get us all killed!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm only borrowing it...&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, the game began. Many points were scored, there was a lot of running and dodging, and one guy even took a hit in the stomach from a really bad pitch (which brought on a slight rules change). Most importantly, everyone had fun.<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, that was great,&quot; one guy said to the inventor of the game. &quot;What'll you call it?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I think I'll name it...&quot;<br />
<br />
He was interrupted by the master of the farm. &quot;OK everyone, back to work. And which one of you lowlifes stole my good china plate?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uh oh...&quot;<br />

Their religion, Meniaism [men-yah-ism], was one of fire and brimstone, displaying pure evil devils and pure good gods who were constantly warring. The time of mankind, according to Meniaism, was a time of peace between the Devils and the Gods. According to Mensa's prophecies, a great war would begin between the two once more in several centuries, and the world would be destroyed. Only those who worshipped and reverred the great Gods who will face the Devils come that final conflict shall survive, and they will be taken to the eternal paradise that is the Land of the Gods, Menit.<br />
<br />
Those who do not worship and rever, according to Meniaism, would either perish in the destruction of the war or be taken back to the Land of the Devils, Anarie, and be tortured slowly and painfully for the rest of their lives. In the era Meniaism arose, it is not surprising that the Nubians fell for it hook, line, and sinker. It did not affect foreign policy [they were certainly not so dumb as to think they could take on every other nation in the world that did not follow Meniaism], but it affected domestic affairs. . .<br />

Invasion of dark cultist forces!<br />
Armies under the command of evil Witch Doctors have invaded Niger, Congo and Nubia. These forces attack as shadows leaping from the night, burning and devastating the countryside. As yet they have met no resistance. Country morale among the defenders is at an all-time low as stories of deadly warriors are told around campfires and grow wilder each telling.<br />

The sudden upsurge of literacy in south africa has made the people interested in reading, about their history, their culture, the nieghbouring tribes, the surrounding geography, etc, to such an extent that they have suddenly lost interest for the world around them.<br />
(cannot increase anything but Education next turn)<br />
<br />
Spreading Literacy<br />
The writing system of South Africa appears to be spreading to the Masai and Zulu people, setting what may become the world standard of writing. (+1 education for Masai and Zululand.)<br />
<br />
Arabians Riot<br />
Turmoil in Arabia has led to a lack of effective government beyond the local region of the capital. (no armies can be moved, cannot increase any one area with more than 10 PP)<br />
Seeing unrest to their east and a scandal to the west, young Mitannis are flocking to the army in case of an attack. (+2 army)<br />
<br />
<br />
Technological Notes<br />
Sotuh Africa has reached tech level 20, allowing the new goverment: Despotism. May now support 3 armies and 2 navies.<br />
It will take one turn without production to change government.<br />

24 hour warning!<br />
I will be leaving for a few week's &quot;holiday&quot; trip to Croatia (my parents planned it) in a few days, so the NES will go on hold then, and I would VERY much like to do one more update before then. If I don't get orders by then, I'm afraid Arabia will be getting wayy ahead of everyone, since I'm now starting with incentives to send orders.<br />
<br />
NEW RULE: A good event for the first person to post orders.<br />
Bad events may happen to those who don't post orders for an inordinately long time without a reason.<br />
It's been 3 fricking days since the update and I have ONE set of orders. In the start I was updating almost daily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Increase army 2 by 3, then attack these &quot;witchdoctors&quot;. [8 PP]<br />
<br />
2) At the same time, hit the foe with the Zealots army.<br />
<br />
3) Increase economy twice. [10 PP]<br />
<br />
4) Spend any remaining PP on Education. [whatever PP is remaining. oo;]<br />
<br />
5) Army 1 is to return to the capital and defend it. Or get as close as it can to the capital. Either one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SPOTLIGHT<br />
Persian Ambassadors visit Arabia!<br />
http://www.savevenice.org/images/Ducal_Palace/Persian_med.jpg<br />
The ambassador have brought rich gifts to Arabia. They seek to establish a trading enclave here in order to facilitate communication.<br />
<br />
The Witch Doctor Cult Invasion:<br />
Niger: Due to inept leadership, the troops have retreated slightly, trying to let the enemies pass, as they are marching north for some strange reason, not west.<br />
Nubia: Caught in a brilliant pincer movement between the Zealots and the Second Army, they engaged in a light skirmish with the latter and are marching at a desperate pace, attempting to reach the capital or some stronghold where they can make fast. The Second Army handled themselves reasonably well for a first combat, and have a far better idea of what they can do against th enemies now.<br />
Congo: Advancing steadily, Congo is offering no resistance due to the invasion from the south.<br />
OOC: Witch doctor cult armies 1 and 2 are 5/3/3/2. army 3 is 4/3/3/2 due to a skirmish with the Nubians.<br />
<br />
Random events:<br />
Saharans grow Idle<br />
With the excessively fertile land and the completion of the great city, the people here have become fat and lazy. The land can no longer support them due to overfarming and lack of rain. (assorted penalties)<br />
<br />
Southern Storms<br />
Among the wreckage blown up onto the shores of South Africa and Zululand is enough material that next turn both can build up to 3 boats for 2PP each.<br />
<br />
This nes is now ON HOLD for the next 3 weeks until 1 August due to my parents taking me first on a trop to Croatia and then kayakking up and down half the coast of Norway.</div></div><hr />
