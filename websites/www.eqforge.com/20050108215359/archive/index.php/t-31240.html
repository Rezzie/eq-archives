<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bvd</div><div class="date">Sep 02, 2002, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One day I start my computer (running Windows OSR-2) only to discover that the entire system registry was gone. I reboot to run Scandisk, and upon scanning the hard drive's file/directory structure I find that every other directory is corrupted. I let it mark all of the bad allocation units and save the lost file clusters... but since I have to confirm each operation, it is a long process. At one point, the system hangs.<br />
<br />
I suspect motherboard failure; could this be it? I know nothing about hardware.<br />
<br />
Anyway the BIOS recognizes the hard drive. I decide to reformat the active partition (I had two partitions) after backing up all salvageable data on floppy. It takes a while and the process is interrupted to recover each individual bad sector. I then change my mind; I decide to remove the formated drive, plus an extended partition and its logical drive to create one large partition (I used FDISK from a Windows 98 CD-ROM and implemented FAT32 support.)<br />
<br />
I then boot from a (manually-made) system disk that had FORMAT.COM from a Windows 98 machine. Upon reformating the hard drive (using a parameter to transfer system files), I get this garbage:<br />
<br />
Invalid or Bad Media at Track 0<br />
<br />
Suggestions?</div></div><hr />

I would try swapping in another HD to make sure it isn't your motherboard but if it is, you may have a lot of equipment to replace.</div></div><hr />

When you get that error message, you may as well hang it up, 'cause that HD ain't goin' nowhere anymore.<br />

(My HD was &quot;cheerfully replaced&quot;, when I took it back.)</div></div><hr />
