<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Mar 17, 2002, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me nothing special. I think being passive against the Romans in GOTM II, while we were the only one on our continent. They killed me eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Mar 17, 2002, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Biggest mistakes: <br />
<br />
1) Attempting the &quot;2 warrior&quot; gambit in the early game against France. When it failed, I spent the next 1000 years catching up (no, I did not reload when it failed). Waiting for swordsmen would have been a better option. <br />
<br />
2) Trading contacts between civs right away. I should have kept them isolated longer to slow down tech. <br />
<br />
3) Not really a mistake, but on this map building cities early on in ICS style would have helped a lot. <br />
<br />
Best moves:<br />
<br />
1) Recovering from my earlier mistakes through a mixture of diplomacy and good tactics in warfare. At one point, I was at war simultaneously with France, Russia, Japan, and Greece (at their instigation, of course). <br />
<br />
2) Having two elite spearmen defend a city I knew I couldn't hold on Greek mainland until a great leader popped out, then rushing a galley to bring him back to mainland and rush the Forbidden Palace. This was the turning point in the game from &quot;I'm being clobbered&quot; to &quot;I'm somewhat equal with the others&quot;<br />
<br />
3) When the rest of the world entered a feeding frenzy on Japan, I waited until their units were gone and then entered the war myself, capturing all their cities at minimal loss. <br />
<br />
4) Instigating wars between the other civs that forced them into Communism; this was how I got a tech lead, followed by...<br />
<br />
5) Researched tanks first. End of game. <br />
<br />
Russia, Egpyt, then Greece fall. Now building up score for a 2050 finish. The current 1580 or so score isn't very good. but I've got another 100 turns to increase it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
#2 Switching from Monarchy.  I'm not much of a Republic type &amp; missed being the King.  Seriously, bothering to research didn't pay off for me in this game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 17, 2002, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main mistakes I made in this GOTM were:<br />
<br />
1.  Sending my Scout south initially, instead of north.  I think it was a &quot;good&quot; decision when considering that the starting position was in the northern portion of the map, just turned out bad.  I ended up missing out on a goody hut by 1 turn.  The French popped the hut and it had barbarians, one of the barbs killed my Scout :(  I was actually planning on using the Scout to hold an Iron resource, but that didn't end up mattering much.  I didn't get any huts though, so this did hurt.  A free Settler on this map could have been worth a lot.<br />
<br />
2.  Not massing my Swordsmen for the initial assault on the French.  A few of my Swordsmen were killed because of this, not too big a deal though as I ended up disbanding about 8 Swordsmen anyways.<br />
<br />
3.  Not prebuilding many Horsemen for upgrading to Knights.  I ended up with too much gold and having to build most of my Knights from scratch.</div></div><hr />

Spoiling info (as Taé is going to say below ;)). This GOTM is not finished yet.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
<br />
That wasn't a mistake, just bad luck. Anytime you find an enemy capital with only warriors for garrison, it's worth taking a chance. <br />
<br />
Worst mistake; taking Minsk near the Russian capital and only then realizing I didn't have enough cash for a temple. Of course, it flipped back. It wasn't really my fault, though. The bad terrain and no rivers meant little income, and it was the finance minister's responsibility anyway, besides the dog ate the national budget, and did I mention? It wasn't really my fault. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirty Clint</div><div class="date">Mar 18, 2002, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My biggest mistake was building the forbidden Palace west of Paris near the gems. This was a handy spot in the early game as I could quickly build a decent army because of it, but later in the game a far more productive spot would have been where Moscow had been.<br />
 After defeating the Greeks I used a GL to build my Palace in Athens and that was when I would have liked to shift the Forbidden Palace as well but it was too much of a  hassle to do so and I had no more GL's anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lawren8</div><div class="date">Mar 19, 2002, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Had just finish my global conquests and had hunkered down <br />
to build, build, build mode and left a home city undefended <br />
near the border. Of couse my neighbor couldn't resist<br />
such an easy target (if it was defended they wouldn't have<br />
attacked), so off into war I'm dragged with my offensive troops<br />
half way around the world. I eventually won after rushing lots<br />
of troops, but it definately set me back alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DamnDirtyApe</div><div class="date">Mar 25, 2002, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two Mistakes:<br />
<br />
1. I did the 'disband your capital' palace switching trick without actually knowing what would happen. I ended up getting my capital in a bad spot. <br />
<br />
2. I built my FP too early, before I really knew where it should go.</div></div><hr />
