<br />
I was hoping you could help me install a new hard drive I bought as a slave.  There's something going wrong, and I can't fix it, and one of my friends came round, and he's good with hardware, and he couldn't get it working.<br />
<br />
What I have is my old 4.3GB HD with the OS etc etc on it, and I want to keep that as the master, and the new 40GB one I want as the slave.  then I put it in, and put all the cords etc on, and i'm pretty sure the jumpers are in the right places.  My CMOS thing is weird, but they're all set to autodetect, so I guess that's fine.<br />
<br />
Now here's the problem.  On loading, it will only detect the one HDD, the 4.3GB one.  Even when the other one's all connected.  If i remove the 4.3GB one, then it detects the other, but not both at the same time.  Does anyone know what's going on, or can direct me to a good site that can help me.  <br />
<br />
This is my first port of call, if this doesn't work out I'll email other places, but i thought i'd give this a go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">col</div><div class="date">Oct 15, 2002, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like both are set to be master. I'd recheck the jumpers to make sure that one is slaved. The orientation of the jumpers varies from make to make!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Oct 15, 2002, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check the jumper settings in the manual. Normally, a drive will have settings for the primary and slave (even a 3rd and 4th one on some HDs). I'm not sure if you have to move the jumper on the first drive. Also, make sure BIOS detects it, too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bobgote</div><div class="date">Oct 15, 2002, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm at uni now, so i can't check it, but i'm pretty sure the jumpers were in the right place.  It has the settings printed on the cover of the HDD.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just another question, on the 2 port grey parallel cable, which should the master be?  I think i got it right, and have tried both ways anywhoo.<br />
<br />
Could it have anything to do with my motherboard/processor/OS not being able to support that size of HD?  I have an AMD 450MHz processor, and am running windows 98 SE.  If you want more info than that, can you tell me how to get it for you?</div></div><hr />

If the CMOS detects the new drive and reports the right size, you're not dealing with a board/OS issue. It's likely a jumper issue. Are the two HD from the same manufactuer? Sometimes two drives from different companies don't work well...<br />
<br />
Your new HD manual should also have directions on what to set the CMOS slave HD to instead of the auto-detect setting. You may have to leave the master on auto-detect and change the slave...but it sure sounds like a jumper issue to me too.</div></div><hr />

I think if you place the jumpers on both drives to &quot;cable select&quot; the drive on the end of the cable automatically becomes the &quot;master&quot;.  At least, that's what the computer store guy told me to do.<br />
<br />
I don't know much about computers - just trying to be helpful.<br />
<br />
Also, could it be the CMOS recognizes the drive but you haven't told windows to deal with it yet?<br />
<br />
From my LIMITED experience, I recall when I added a HD to an existing W2K machine:<br />
<br />
1. The OS didn't recognize the drive (or at least I couldn't initially access the drive) through the &quot;my computer&quot; icon, or install anything on it.  It was physically there, but nothing in windows recognized it even existed.<br />
<br />
2. By going through [administrative tools --&gt; computer management --&gt; disk management] I could &quot;add&quot; the hard drive and have W2K format and assign a drive letter to it.<br />
<br />
After that process the drive could be dealt with from anywhere in windows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have A Maxtor and a Quantum. The jumpers are completely different on them. One was vertical for master; the other was vertical for slave.<br />
<br />
If each drive is Ok without the other, its definitely a jumper problem.<br />
<br />
Last thought - check the jumper itself isnt broken and is joing the pins.<br />
<br />
I lost the instructions too but I think you can get the correct config from the respective websites IIRC.</div></div><hr />

Same company, both seagate.  (hope they're not too bad)<br />

It has the instructions on it, but my CMOS thing is weird, and not what i'm used to at all.  I could do it on an older computer, but this is just weird.<br />

I didn't have the cable select jumper on.  maybe i should put it on.  need some more of the jumpery things tho.<br />
<br />
and I have software to do the work once i get to windows, but the CMOS needs to get it first.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for your input everyone.  I'll check those jumpers out as soon as i can.  (prolly not til saturday :( too many assignments)</div></div><hr />

Dont use cable select, just set the main os one to master and have it alone.  set the other one to slave and slave it to the CD-ROM.</div></div><hr />

Hey!  Does this mean you like national lampoon's animal house?<br />
<br />
and penvzila:  they are different speeds, i'll take your advice on board :goodjob:  (the new one is nice n fast :D)</div></div><hr />

<br />
One school of thought says never mix hard drives and CD drives on one IDE cable!</div></div><hr />

Try that maybe. I know it doesn't help you since you want to run the OS on the older one, but with your OS on the new one the computer will run faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bobgote</div><div class="date">Oct 20, 2002, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well it all works now<br />
<br />
actually i'm pretty sure it was the second thing i tried, but it seemed to work this time :confused: oh well, i'm not complainin :D.  Thanks for all your help anyways.</div></div><hr />
