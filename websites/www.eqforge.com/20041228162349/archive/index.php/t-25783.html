<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TedG</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering if there's a way to block those spyware programs like &quot;Bonzi Buddy&quot; and &quot;Comet Cursor&quot; that occasionally install themselves when Web-surfing. This usually happens when I'm searching for something on Google, and clicking on links to sites I haven't been to before, in which case I don't know what to expect. But these programs just install themselves, without asking, and even when you uninstall them, there's still crap left over (which can usually be eliminated using Ad-Aware). It's just annoying to have to go through and clear out all the crap that those programs leave behind. The most recent one that I got was some stupid &quot;Search Explorer&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
So basically, is there a way to stop these things from installing themselves? I'm using Windows XP and Internet Explorer 6, with all the latest updates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you can disable them using the registry if you know how or else I could post a little something and tell you. I think it's under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE key and you go to software and then look for the key belonging to the annoying prog. That way they will not install again but shouldn't come up when you start your machine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TedG</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I was able to clear out all traces of them, including registry entries, but it's still annoying to have to do that each time. What I'm looking for is a way to keep them from installing in the first place, maybe an IE setting or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 02:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, i know what you are asking for but as I said I don't know of a way. Of course, you could try taking them from the registry but not deleting them from the computer, that has usually kept them out of my hair even if they are still installed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TedG</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If it's at all possible, I don't want to have any traces of them because I hate spyware. And it's a waste of HD space, too. I always try and have a clean HD and clean registry - I'm weird like that.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then my only suggestion would be to search download.com for a spyware blocker, and then tell us if you get lucky. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 03:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use At Guard 3.22.... it's a couple years old now, but works great.  Stops anything you choose, and can be site specific.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Adaware from http://www.lavasoftusa.com/ will work nicely.  Also consider a decent firewall to block those programs from communicating with their makers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TedG</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I installed ZoneAlarm, so hopefully it will block those installations if they happen again. I don't remember any of the sites where it happened, so I won't know for sure if ZA will block it until I happen to end up on one of those sites again.<br />
<br />
And yes, I do have Ad-Aware. That's a great program.:goodjob:</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Black Ice Defender is pretty good.<br />
<br />
But I just carve any nonsense out of my registry, if they try and hide themselves :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zelig</div><div class="date">Aug 10, 2002, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The retail version of Ad-aware comes with a program called Ad-watch which watches installations of programs and notifies you if any spyware tries to install.  It can then stop the spyware from installing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oryx</div><div class="date">Aug 11, 2002, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can confirm that Zone Alarm does not stop things like Comet Cursor from installing. I don't think any of the fire walls would stop this because these annoyances are installed with java or activeX. Fire walls aren't designed to stop that kind of stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 12, 2002, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is why I run a firewall, and I run an ad-killer.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, Firewall does not equal ad killer.<br />
<br />
Also, stopping popup java scripts is NOT ad killing.  It is only what it says... stopping popups.<br />
<br />
If people want the final solution to the Ad problem, you need to run specialty software to hunt and kill ads.<br />
<br />
But if you don't have that software, Opera can easily disable and enable the popups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neomega</div><div class="date">Oct 14, 2002, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just installed ad aware.<br />

This is for the webmaster I think.... I dunno too much about this stuff, but I am thinkin this might be helpful in killing spy ware riders on your website if you have any... I dunno, it was written by a guy who runs a game fansite... so maybe someone might want to take a look at it, cuz, I rarely visit many sites save Civfanatics, Apolyton, Netscape (for my webmail :P), and I have got a bit of spyware.... I always suspected these fan sites althouggh more than likely I am wrong.<br />
<br />
Anyways, on page two is some program or somethin to hunt down the parasites if they are feasting off of your traffic :)</div></div><hr />
