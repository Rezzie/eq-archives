<br />
It seems building a city on the grassland square on Coresux' northern tip in the not too distant future is a good idea since this is a strategically good location for ships, it is close to all three Woodstock cities.<br />
<br />
I think we should try finishing ASAP everything we need to start celebrating (the wonders in particular), therefore the recommendation to set taxes to 70%. Also we are not going to get big $$ from caravan deliveries in the next several turns.<br />
<br />
There are some barb concerns near BBF that can be solved by spending a small amount of cash there.<br />
<br />
We will either acquire or discover Navigation soon; this opens up the possibility of building Magellan to speed up our ships.<br />
<br />
Finally, using RF as a 'backup city' for wonders is recommended. This means that if we want to (and can) build two wonders simultaneously, probably because of AI actions, we would build a wonder in RF in addition to Neu. The reason for selecting RF is its central location, there are several caravans nearby.</div></div><hr />

<br />
RF as backup wonder city is a great idea.<br />
<br />
Magellen's would be good to have, but the others are more important and the AI is already builidng Magellens, so seems we have little chance of getting it.  I would hate to make a play for it and then have the AI switch to something we really wanted and take it from us.</div></div><hr />
