That was when Syracuse was the second most important Greek city. When the Syracusians changed sides in the war between the Romans and Carthginians, the Romans attacked. The Greeks has a Giant Claw designed by Archimedes that could lift and capsize the Roman Galleons. That and a great wall kept the Romans at bay for two years until some traitors openned the gates.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Archimedes' Claw would make a great Wonder or super unit in any scenario of the period. I wonder if anybody has ever used it.<br />
<br />
Alcib, isn't it about time you tried to make a scneario. I'd bet my last dollar that you would be great at it. This could be a possible one for you to try (plus you're of Greek origin)</div></div><hr />

Kull used the claw as a shore battery improvement in his Ancient Empires, the early empires, scenario. If I made a scenario, how would I have the time to help everybody else with theirs? http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

I read somewhere Archimedes had also designed a giant lense or mirror that could act like an &quot;ancient laser&quot; (hmm, sorry I don´t know how to describe it exactly), it had the ability to set ships in flames, even at higher distance. <br />
But in another book they said (if I remember correctly - it was long ago I read that) that all these things didn´t really exist. I´d like to know more about them...http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

They also quoted several works by ancient historians describing the siege. I don't think the lens laser was true though since they didn't even have mirrors in those days and we didn't get the technology to build giant lenses until the 20th century.<br />
<br />
Back to the Alcib scenario building campaign. Maybe building one yourself would help you to understand more aspects of other people's scenarios. Its good to be well rounded and I KNOW you are good with computers.<br />
<br />
Doesn't anyone else agree with me?</div></div><hr />
