Do not forget you are here in the CIV2 DemoGame............ Not civ3.</div></div><hr />

The idea sounds intriguing, but we all need much more info (and don't have time to go scour the Civ3 forum to see what it's all about).  Perhaps you three can write up a proposal and then post it for comment?</div></div><hr />

I didn't read all of it, but it seems rather ehm..  complex..<br />
Looks like fun though, only could be a little more simple IMO</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is what some newcomers (and Vet players alike) said about the rule set :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2003, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked at it, and as DvR I didn't really feel like reading all of it. So if someone who knows what it's all about (puglover, CG, naervod maybe) could at least give a brief explanation about what it is.<br />
To me it seemed as if each citizen could play some role along with the game? Maybe it could be fun...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2003, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically, each citizen starts out with a certain amount of gold. This is not like Dungeons and Dragons-style hack and slash RPGs. Rather, you gain money from income made each time the game is played and also from sales from businesses that players start up. With the money, you can gain land and cities. Then you can build up armies and fight other players with them. Also, you can win money from tournaments, where you build up an individual character and compete against others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elsaak</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2003, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The idea of fighting each other in the CIV2 DG was banished (it was spoke in the political parties.)<br />
<br />
But if you can improve the concept, it could interest many people...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is a lot of people needed for such a thing? I mean, there are less than 15 active citizens in this game.<br />
Sounds fun though:)</div></div><hr />

No. :(<br />
<br />
But I think PMing would be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2003, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have decided to make it simpler and very different from the Civ 3 RPG. First of all, all of it will be played out in story form meaning: Each of the players gets there own character with a certain amount of gold. You can then buy items (price set by mod of the game) and then you go out on adventures. The mod would generally be responsible for running the adventure so there would be three adventures at a time (one by me, one by puglover, and one by CG, although if any of us can do more than one, that is fine). Then, the mods can determine the results based on the characters decisions. The characters would fight bandits and maybe skirmish other characters from time to time, and in times of war an adventure could be doing a special mission for our army. Also, about the political parties thing, I don't exactly see how characters fighting each other could relate to slate voting or political parties, so please enlighten me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">puglover</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2003, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very good! I love the idea! :) (We REALLY need a clapping smilie! :lol: )</div></div><hr />

<br />
- do we actually need an active game of Civilization?<br />
- if so then: is it controlled by one person (such as in our demo game)?<br />
- what exactly is a character? as in: a CivII unit, or is it more like a textbased RPG (mud) character...<br />
- what's the use of gold..  is there actually something to buy, or is it only a scoring system?<br />
<br />
If someone could answer these questions, thx :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
if your RGP is only something that can give us more fun, it's OK ; but if it creates tensions between the citizens, it's risky : we are not so much, so we need everybody stay involved and active.</div></div><hr />

1. I don't think so. Although sometimes happenings in the Demogame will affect the game. Like new techs and wars.<br />
<br />
2. No<br />
<br />
3. It's a citizen. He can go on errands and start businesses and even fight as a soldier in the army.<br />
<br />
4. You can buy lots of things. As long as you have a store to go to and an imagination.<br />
<br />

Yes. I don't like the idea of feuds between citizens. :)</div></div><hr />

Also, you don't NEED to be involved in the RPG to play the Demogame. You can play the Demogame as a citizen yet not participate in the RPG. That's what I was looking to see.  As fun as this idea could be (and I do enjoy RPGs), I really doubt I would have the time to maintain my involvement in the demo game AND get involved in some sort of RPG, unless it were kept very simple and quick.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to make it a requirement that to participate in the RPG you have to also participate in the Demogame, but ideally, it is hoped that those who do particpate in the RPG will also particpate in the Demogame.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">puglover</div><div class="date">Mar 15, 2003, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. Because the events in the game strongly effect how the RPG goes.</div></div><hr />

He was when the RPG first started and he transeferd power to Shai and Eyrei.</div></div><hr />

It didn't become active until the second Civ 3 game, which, by that time I was already passing on the Mod duties.  The game may be quite different if I was still a Mod for it. ;)</div></div><hr />
