<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archer99</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2002, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked at some of the submitted games for GOTM and certain people have saved games where their cities are not in civil disorder when there is no possible way for them to not be. With max garrison and 100% luxuries everyone is still unhappy. If everyone was entertainers the city would starve. I doubt anyone had all their people as entertainers the year before they submitted their game and set them back to unhappy before saving the next time. Is there some legit method that I'm missing or do they have some file that lets them cheat? I could do a lot better than I do if my cities never went into civil disorder and could have full productivity with 100% unhappy citizens.<br />
<br />
When I save a game with a city in civil disorder it is still in disorder when I load it and I've thought of every possibility but can't figure it out.<br />
<br />
Another question I have is how do you time a cultural victory for exactly 2050 AD? I can see conquest, domination and space race for 2050 victories but not culture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a culture victory at 2050 you sell most of your culture buildings when you get close to the 100,000 mark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, kinda like what da_greatest said.  You watch how many culture points you are gaining per turn (by the culture advisor screen) and how many turns are remaining and sell off any extra temples/libraries you have that would cause you to hit it too early.  This is easy when you will hit 100,000 culture points (cp) and definitely know that the AI will not hit 50,000 cp.  If the AI is over 50,000 cp, then it can be difficult since you don't know exactly how much you need to be double the culture of them.</div></div><hr />

Are you opening up 1.16f games in 1.17f?  If so it might have something to do with the pop rush rule changes.  In 1.16f you could pop rush indefinitely with the proper garrisons and luxuries.  That could build up a huge amount of unhappiness by 1.17f standards.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is the case, but it's the only explaination I can think of.  In any case, unhappy citizens add nothing to a player's score, so it wouldn't be a very good &quot;cheat&quot; to have used in past competitions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archer99</div><div class="date">Apr 09, 2002, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So in 1.16f pop rushing didn't make unhappy people? Unhappy people producing still make military units and culture buildings, advance research and pay maintences cost and so on so it would still be a very effective cheat.<br />
<br />
I suppose that could be it, people could do things in old versions that are no longer possible, that's why their results are impossible to duplicate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 09, 2002, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In 1.17f pop rushing unhappiness was changed from 20 to 40 turns per rush.  In 1.16f the unhappiness was &quot;lost&quot; hidden beneath itself, never requiring more than 1 happy face per unhappy citizen.  That has changed in 1.17f as well.</div></div><hr />
