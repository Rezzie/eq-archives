<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Oct 05, 2002, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I cannot advise with the MS program but what I use for my 2 comps connected by standard ethernet is Sygate.<br />
http://www.sygate.com/<br />
<br />
You can set one comp (the one with the modem or the like) as server and the other as client. The version I use is easily configurable and works absolutely fine. :yeah:<br />
<br />
There are also other programs out there that do the same.<br />
And of course you can use a hardware router, e.g. an old comp running 24/7 and only running the routing software.<br />
<br />
I tried the MS crap, too, but it never really worked, not even partly.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 06, 2002, 03:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All you have to do is to configure the other computers. Ctrl Panels&gt;network&gt;tcp/ip (something like that, I don't know how it's said in English version of Win98, since I have the French one)<br />
<br />
TCP/IP properties: choose automatically get a IP address.<br />
Default gateway: 192.168.0.1<br />
That's all folks :)<br />
<br />
Ah, just forgot this: if you have a software firewall such as zonealarm, installed on your routing computer, you might have to go in its preferences and check &quot;my computer is an ICS gateway&quot; option. Otherwise your local machines won't be able to acces the internet.<br />
<br />
Edit: You can always use Winroute, which is by far the best software router, and not Sygate. It's really a pain (sygate). Or, if you're like PH, i.e. a millionaire, very very rich ;) you can afford a hardware router. Now, the Belkin ADSL modem/integrated router/switch are quite affordable. ~€120...</div></div><hr />

Anyway, as I said, normally software firewall must have an ICS aware option.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 09, 2002, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, all you need is to have the modem installed on your 386. And configured to access it. Since it's quite a pain under DOS, I'll advise you to use Linux.<br />
But please have a look here (http://www.homenethelp.com/) it'll teach you much better than me :) I'm more used with doing myself than showing to the others, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">t92300</div><div class="date">Oct 10, 2002, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you dont know how to fix a floppy drive do you refer to this thread  http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=33569 thanks its bout the 14 post down</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 10, 2002, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can always buy a new floppy drive.. It's quite cheap :)<br />
That'll spare you having to buy medicines for your headache, trying to repair it. Are you sure you put your floppy cable in the right way? (red pin far from the power supply plug, contrary to hard drives)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">t92300</div><div class="date">Oct 10, 2002, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i ve tried 7 drives many times in any way i can try the cable and ive tried 4 controlers i think i might get another 486 should be able to find one for free just about <br />
