I always play either the Americans or the Romans when playing for fun or multi player. But if I'm playing for a high score then it is always one of the Orange Civ's, Greek, Carthaginians or English. I don't know why, but that is just how I play and I have gotten use to having a huge number of orange cities on the map.<br />
That's why I'm playing the English in my bid for the Deity high score, they are the only once that I haven't played all the way up.<br />

This is not because I'm English! It's simply because the orange colour is very distinctive and impossible to confuse.<br />
<br />
I never use the suggested English city names - I always invent new ones which are appropriate to the geography so that I remember where they are. Which will probably mean I'll rename all the existing cities in GOTM #2!<br />

<br />
I seem to like the Babylonians, but why, don't know.<br />
<br />
But I wonder... do the different Civ's have different characteristics? For example, do they have a tendency to start with a different set of knowledge?<br />
<br />
At least the computer seems to play different civs with different style.<br />
<br />
Just wondering if it were possible to choose a favorite civ on this basis.</div></div><hr />

You could have substituted the &quot;v&quot; in abrevviations, to make another &quot;b&quot; and make &quot;abbreviations&quot; and you would still end up with 87 characters (including spaces).<br />
