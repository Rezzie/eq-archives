<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Feb 28, 2003, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Off we go with the first Presidential election of Demogame III.<br />
<br />
We have CivGeneral - former Military Advisor, Jayne - former President amoungst many Government posts, and Octavian X - a favourite choice as vice-president on many occasions! ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to post why you should be elected, or why you have voted.<br />
<br />
Get voting, and have fun!!!!!<br />
<br />
Polls open for 8 days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Feb 28, 2003, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vote for CivGeneral<br />
<br />
Vote for CivGeneral because, I am interested in becoming president here at the Civ2 Demogame so that I can transfer my skills for President in the next election at the Civ3 DG. I wish to become President so that I can at least get a start in the upper level of the Government in the Demogame.<br />
<br />
If I lose I can always be the Doughnut apprentace ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Feb 28, 2003, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why should you vote for me? I'm committed to the game. I'm an experienced President - which I think is important in the early years of the game. I have the time to spare to play the turns at regular interval.<br />
<br />
Vote Jayne!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Feb 28, 2003, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jayne, my Despotess, all the way !<br />
<br />
Of course ! !<br />
<br />
There is no other choice ! ! !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">puglover</div><div class="date">Feb 28, 2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would have voted for CivGeneral but Jayne contributed most to the game so she got my vote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cecasander</div><div class="date">Feb 28, 2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why would we choose a president when we didn't even invent monarchy? :P<br />
<br />
I think a female president in progressive enough for me, so Jayne gets my vote.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Its actualy quite strange;<br />
a democracy without political parties :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Feb 28, 2003, 06:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why Vote Octavian?<br />
<br />
Doughnuts.  Lotsa doughnuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shahadet</div><div class="date">Mar 01, 2003, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted for Jayne. :worshp: The other choices were not forthcoming with a good reason to elect them. Besides the game needs a leader that is reliable and dedicated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DvR</div><div class="date">Mar 01, 2003, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems like Jayne setted up most of the Demo game III and seems to be most involved.. Therefor she gets my vote..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Mar 02, 2003, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vote for CivGeneral for Vice President :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flying Elephant</div><div class="date">Mar 02, 2003, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted Octavian. It'd be nice to try something different, since the other two candidates are either previous presidents or very likely to become president soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Mar 03, 2003, 10:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jayne has been a wonderful Queen, but I think the demo game will benefit from new blood.  It is important to have experience in this position, however, so I am voting for Octavian, and hope CivGeneral sticks around for next term's nominations :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dont worry, I will stick around for the Next term's Nominations. Then Ill make my second atempt for President :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Mar 03, 2003, 10:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was unexpected, to say the least.  Last time I checked, I was losing to CivGeneral.  :D<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind my old Vice Presidential Office.  Let's see, I get it again this term, that would make it 4 terms being a heartbeat away.  Then again, I did enjoy my time as President here also.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">Mar 03, 2003, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess you are wanting to know who else voted for you CG. Take a wild guess :D.<br />
<br />
Also, there will be someone new running for President next term. Take another wild guess :D.</div></div><hr />
