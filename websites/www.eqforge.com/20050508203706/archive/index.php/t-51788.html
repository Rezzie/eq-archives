<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Apr 27, 2003, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome to the Land Office. This is our main branch. There isnt exactly much to do right now, seeing as we lack map making. Once we get that, its Beaurocracy galore!<br />
<br />
I am pleased to announce the development of a generator for events in relavance to loos and gain of tile (My sincere thanks go to CT for her help). Before each TC, I or one of my deputies will run the generator. Depending on what comes up,  ALL  tiles will be effected by that for the first turn of the TC. It could be something good, like +5 shields, or bad, like -3 food. I will post it in an index post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Apr 27, 2003, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Land Rules<br />
<br />
1. Might makes right. The despot starts out with everything and everybody else grovels at his feet.<br />
<br />
2. As territory grows it gets beyond the ability of one character to control. New nobles are raised to run these territories. They are sworn to allegiance but rebellions have been known to happen. The despot can actually give away land but this generally only happens as a reward to a long time loyal follower. More often the lesser nobles are running the despot’s land in service to him.<br />
<br />
3. It’s possible for there to be more than one despot. If a revolt succeeds and is not put down by the despot that territory is then a separate entity. Note that newly acquired territory in the demogame still goes to the despot who holds the demogame capital.<br />
<br />
4. In a monarchy new land goes to the most logical king. That is the royal character that has adjoining lands, nearby capital, etc.<br />
<br />
5. In republic and democracy new land is offered for general sale to the populace.<br />
<br />
6. In communism all land reverts to control of the government.<br />
<br />
7. Land provides a number of gold, shields and food that it would generate if worked in a city. If no city controlled by the tile owner can access the tile it never makes more than what is shown when right clicking on the tile in the game. Gold can be converted to food or shields with one gold making 1/2 of either. If currency hasn’t been discovered yet all gold produced must be taken as shields or food.<br />
<br />
8. Cities produce the number of gold, shields and food for the tile they reside on plus an additional gold for each population point.<br />
<br />
9. A single contiguous land territory that has at least 5 * P (where “P” is the number of provinces in the demogame) will receive an additional gold per tile in the territory. If the territory has 10 * P receives 2 gold per tile in the territory and one that has 15 * P receives 3 gold per tile in the territory.<br />
<br />
10. The Land Manager has overall authority over land issues and is responsible for keeping track of ownership, territories and the base g/f/s values of the tiles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 -In a monarchy, it could be more fun to have multiple Lords and a king, like middle age Europe, lot's of little towns with their own Lord and a King in the Capital, or maybe two Kings, you know, divide the nation in two and see what happens, after all, the concept of nation didn't arrive until the 18th &amp; 19th century. <br />
<br />
 -In republics and democracy, it would also be nice to have a land rush not unlike those that ocurred in the States after the west was won, that way, those that can't buy lands can have a taste of land ownership.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 07, 2003, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@SAAM - We can't wait until mapmaking to have territories. The despot should already be managing/assigning territory for use so units can be raised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">May 07, 2003, 05:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey! Mr. Despot! Yea, Im talking to you (Plex?). Im here waiting...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 07, 2003, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shaitan: The despot will be using the first few land tiles we have on his own propably... he needs units, he needs wealth :-)<br />
As we get more land, the despot will propably give land to his humblest followers to govern it (propably other cities than the capitol, far out provinces etc.). this way ownership will spread with the time.<br />
<br />
Ehecatl: the land rush in america was only there because nobody owned the land. the reason was that america skipped all the land-ownerhip methodogy of the ancient and middle aged aeras.<br />
in europe, there was no land rush because the land was divided between the nobles before. as the nobles had to pay more and more for maintaining their land, units and buildings, they were forced to first lent the land away and later sell the land. otherwise we would not have any land ownerships in europe :-)<br />
the land was also often the price people got for loyal followership over generations. with monarchy as tech, the nobles will struggle between each other for land. the monarch himself needs not hold the most land.<br />
<br />
<br />
but with writing this something else arizes:<br />
the despot should not be dependent on land-ownership for unit building or other expenses!<br />
we should have a defined amount of shields / gold / food per land tile in the nation going to the state for maintenance of national troops, which will be under the controll of the leader.<br />
the resources could also be used for other purposes, privately or nationally, like building palaces, monuments, paying assasins...<br />
<br />
this way the leader can freely give away land without fearing to be without troops or other ownings.<br />
<br />
also:<br />
cities in the middle ages and the ancient times were NOT owned by anybody. people built there and used the resources in a small scale. the ownership of a city is mainly defined by its surroundings or stationed troops inside the city.<br />
<br />
as such, the national troops of the leader could be stationed in citites to maintain peace. in any non-staioned city any citizen can call out a revolution and draft troops out of the resources of the city. the leader could moove any unit through any territory within the nation at will without explicit allowance.<br />
and of course he can attack units of his citizens at any time (for example to fight down a revolution or fight another noble who is not loyal enough)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">May 12, 2003, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stuck, I'd recommend something to you that I'm doing in the conflict office.  Place a limit on the land a person can effectively control.<br />
<br />
Take a look at Atrous' stats, and set a limit for the tiles he can control before he has to appoint loyal administrators to look after the land, and allow those admins to use the land as they wish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 02:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that was the intention from the basic rules as written. Just the particulars need to be set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i suppose that we could introduce a kind of &quot;land corruption&quot; which will cripple land output if no local administration is applied. this could vary with the governments.<br />
<br />
for example during despotism, the corruption reduction should be 25% for each tile distance to the loctaion of the local administration.<br />
for monarchy, this could be set to 20%, for republic to 15% and for democraty to 5%.<br />
<br />
example:<br />
if the despot has his &quot;home&quot; in the capitol, the capitol tile will have 0% reduction of its output. all tiles around the capitol will have a 25% reduced output. all tiles around them 50%, all tiles around them 75% and all tiles more than 4 tiles away would have no output at all.<br />
<br />
if he wants to prevent this he can set up a &quot;local administration&quot; in another city. the same rules would apply to that city. the local &quot;administrator&quot; (or maybe grand visir) would be able to completely use the tiles as he wishes, but the despot, who would be the owner of those tiles legally, could demand a %-age of the tile output as tax, for example.<br />
the &quot;local administrator&quot; could raise troops and therefor later on attack the despot if he wishes to gain ownership of the lands he administrates.</div></div><hr />

I know it has been decreed that Helena will control the city, so I suppose it goes to Dis...<br />
But that means Helena can set up as the despot for there and we will have 2 despots...<br />
<br />
Ill read Dis's post above this and think .</div></div><hr />

As for Dis's idea:<br />
Corruption is a good idea. Its just that your factors may be a little high. If there is an admin in every town, thats good.<br />
I like it.<br />
<br />
Just remember: We all have until Map Making, technically, to draft up a final land set. Ill be working on it later this week</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ehecatl Atzin</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">wait a minute, we are living in a primite comunism (to quote Engels) land doesn't belong to anyone, it is communal, therefore no land should be distributed along the despots loyal subjects, after all, under despotism power is controled via fear, if you give land you give power...<br />
It wasn't until monarchy that the king started giving land since monarchy isn't based on fear, but on nobility and honour (based on Montesquieu) I think we should hold off the land giving part until monarchy, land ownership this early in the game is just too early, there are no titles during despotism, there is the despot and no one else.<br />

I requested troops many days ago and they were denied to me by the fact that they were never authorized. Because the troops were never authorized by Octavian X, I never received them. Therefore you were never given them by me. All this is moot as none of it has really happened.</div></div><hr />

You would also have no army whatsoever by your own ruling, and have no power to crush any rebellion.  I think you should accept the existance of troops, including your own.  If you don't like the rebellions occurring, you should use your troops to crush them, not start whining about game technicalities and Oct's rule that is invalid.</div></div><hr />

They cannot be set by unilateral declaration of one manager, especially resource rules, which would be a land manager decision even if one manager could declare rules.  The rules that are being violated were agreed to in a decision of the populace, and cannot be overruled without due process, in this case, a vote.  Also, do you admit that you have no troops under your command if we were to go with what you said?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, if you've been paying attention, boots, you'd realize that the Despot already collected the resources for the tiles he owns. In fact the resources he had in his balance were used by Mellita and Marcus. If Stuck or Octavian X is paying attention, they will realize this. Civ can claim that territory, but he will not be able to raise troops. And that's where I'm headed first. His stone -throwing peasants wont stand a chance.</div></div><hr />

@all- the comment was sarcasam. You know, when you make a sarcastic remark. Im NOT creating my own country.<br />
Now, lemme get this straight. Dis, Using Bellona, is the  OFFICIAL despot. He/she is Diutius's successor. Little Italy, Artura and Nara Shadda are now back under Fanatican control, as are Dis's two other kingdoms. It is FANATICA again, not fanatica et all.<br />
<br />
Is that so far correct?<br />
If so, you're asking for a full tile value of all of Fanatica.<br />
<br />
If this is wrong, please correct. I just got online from being down due to new router instalation</div></div><hr />

http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads4/Fanatica.JPG<br />
<br />
I think it is correct. Also, Helena and Fanatica are the country, but i was showing Helena's land too. Antony and Nero are in Nar shaddaaland (NSL)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 22, 2003, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So for my view:<br />
* The lands which were given away by the despots of fanatica officially will be existing until attacked or whatever.<br />
* Any land tiles not given away by an offical despot of fanatica but otherwise claimed are back under fanatican controll.<br />
* Bellona is the successive despot of fanatica<br />
* Tasius is controlling part of the army, Bellona the other part, Helena the third part.<br />
<br />
i nevertheless dont know who has usage rights at the moment. i believe the only ones with active territories are (in players) plexus, bootstoots and civgeneral as diutius deleted some ownings before he went off.<br />
i also believe those are the only nations formed... <br />
but correct me if im wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
here is an announcement of some land grants helenatican administration is going to give out for the next TC:<br />
<br />
atrousia: O6+O7<br />
disaamuel: O8-999, P8-999,Q8-999,R8-999<br />
<br />
these grants will be effective from the next TC on. so there will be no change in the land-income for this TC.<br />
also note that i will update the map to reflect the new borders asap.<br />
<br />
the sense of this is mainly giving both atrousia and disaamuel 1 tile more to their west. in case of disaamuel province, i thought it would be nice to extend it completely to the SE to make it &quot;look&quot; like a real coastal province rather than a enclave inside helenatica.</div></div><hr />

i think this is a good idea to roleplay mapmaking. we just define mapmaking as the tech needed to make an international map with standardized grids and metrics... as such, we should DEFINITELY have a own grid-system for each province and nation, as well maybe also different naming systems for the coordinates (some could use 1/1, come A/1, some 1/A for example) and maybe even conflicting names for landmarks (2 people of different nations could talk about the same landmark with different names if the origin from different places).<br />
all this could then be standardized with mapmaking and the first international maps of the land-office :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2003, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@land office, concerning corruption:<br />
maybe an alternative idea to land corruption / something to add ontop of it...:<br />
<br />
land maintenance cost!<br />
the keeping of land should cost persons something... gold!<br />
so with currency, we could implement cost for landownership, maybe even raising with the government type ;-)<br />
<br />
example for despotism:<br />
each tile above#   ----    cost in gold/tc<br />
0 --- 0<br />
10 ---- 1<br />
15 ---- 2<br />
20 ---- 3<br />
25 ---- 4<br />
30 ---- 5<br />
35 ---- 10<br />
... and then the cost double each 5 tiles<br />
<br />
examples:<br />
if i own &lt;10 tiles, i pay nothing for them<br />
tiles# --- payment in gold/tc<br />
10 --- 0<br />
15 --- 5<br />
20 --- 15<br />
25 --- 30<br />
30 --- 50<br />
35 --- 75<br />
40 --- 125<br />
45 --- 225<br />
50 --- 425<br />
55 --- 825<br />
60 --- 1625<br />
65 --- 3225<br />
...<br />
<br />
just something to think about :-)<br />
this will make people decide to either have much land and no money, or have money and fewer tiles...<br />
<br />
together with corruption this would be a beast, but maybe alone it would help keeping things simple :-)<br />
<br />
not that the above thing should only be applied to tiles in ownership which were not given away for usage (i still think the split between ownership and usage right is necessary)<br />
<br />
so the example for tile usage would be:<br />
i own 60 tiles, but 40 are given away completely for usage (i have no income from them)...<br />
as such, only 20 tiles will count for the maintenance, and i would have to pay only 15 instead of 1625g/tc.<br />
of course if i get full-usage of tiles which are under other ownership, they will add to my count:<br />
in the above example, if i in addition to my 60 tiles ownership (as you remember with 40 given away usage) get usage of 10 other tiles from another character, then my effective tilecount would be 30 and thus i would have to pay 50 g/tc instead of 15 g/tc</div></div><hr />
