<br />
I've yet to find a very good scenario that fits my taste. I would build one on my own but I'm not very talented when it comes to scenario creation.<br />
<br />
So here's the deal: I looking for a person who is completly AWESOME at creating scenarios. I want to create the Ultimate wwIII Scenario. I have all the technical data on the units and stuff that's my specialty. I need some help putting it all together.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

But i really need some help in the scenario creation department..you see I can always make to scenarios but they never work how i wanted them to. For instance the last time i tried to do it on my own, I spent hour working (more like days) on the thing, Then when i'm all finished I go to play it and all the units that are set for a defensive posture are Banned for the build list.<br />
<br />
So what i really need is someone who would help me do that.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Civ 2 codes curse again... let me explain briefly... in my Antigonos scen, i created several unmovable units to serve as fortress or barbaric settlements... placed them... and *puff* Horsemen and Chariot gone, vanished, Kaputt... http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/frown.gif You can't imagine how much i tribulate to approximatively replace them... I had to recreate this units as unmovable units on naval units' slot...<br />

Don't try to modify too much parameters or values, or they'll made interfernce each other...</div></div><hr />

I know that in my Outerspace patch, there were a couple of ships that were giving players money for making them...unexpected value changes made this possible...I might use this glitch to make something else work in  another scenario though...hehe<br />

By any chance have you read all the design tips over at Apolyton S-League (sorry I shouldn't be mentioning this on this forum- but each Civ site has got its own virtues). Before I made STBAQ, I knew next to nothing about scenario making and I just read all the articles there which gave me enough knowledge to do STBAQ.<br />
<br />
(Civfan is rapidly building its own tips section of course)</div></div><hr />

Nope. That must be another kobayashi. I only arrived on the scene at the end of last year so I am a four month old newbie and everything I know is from reading from the real experts. If I had been around for a long time, I would have garnered enough brownie points to make it to the HOF he he he. Sadly, there is very little to discover or innovate now that civ2 had be analysed inside out.</div></div><hr />

I've played soem really nice sceanrios with horrible units. <br />
<br />
Another thing is resorces, if you can't get production up enough to overwhelm your enimies in cearios that are based on war. its no good. Cities should be able to produce at least 40 shields.<br />
<br />

<br />
I've played a scenario or two of yours, and find no problems what so ever. I used to have a WWII scenario that you made (i think you said it was one of your first),It was almost perfect(not saying there was anything wrong). I wish i could get it back agian. do you know what i'm talking about?<br />
<br />
Another one of my gripes is land mass size. Gee i wish youe could make 10  cities is germay with room to spare, and still balance our the rest of the theatre.<br />

<br />
That can definitely be a problem. I am trying to make an &quot;Ancient World&quot; modpack/scenario (actually both) and one problem is that there is just not enough space in Italy to place the Roman cities, not enough space in Greece, and not enough space in Mesopotamia. Those areas are really crowded, while North Africa and Eastern Europe are almost empty.<br />
<br />
The problem is to make a map that is large enough for the cities, without being inaccurate, or silly-looking.<br />

I think there should be more Air units in a WWIII scenario...<br />

There's Israel vs. PLO, Milosevic in Serbia, just last week, Macedonia started firing at Albanians. You can't forget the IRA vs. the English. It's basically fought over beliefs and terrorists.<br />
Have the scenario start around 1995 and end around 2020. with nukes, but there not the most powerful weapon. Biological Warfare, like I'm doing for my modern world scenario.<br />
Bio is more powerful than Nuke because it leaves the city intact, just killing units and people, all improvements would remain, I think.<br />
I would assume the 7 civs would be: Slavs, NATO, Far East, Arabs(PLO), Indians, Irish(IRA), and Russia. Include the Israeli city of Jerusalem, and the Albanian city of Tirane, in NATO.<br />

I actually started a WWIII/cold war scenario and I used: <br />

- Western Europe(included Australia, Greenland, Scandinavia, Iceland, Greece)<br />
- Soviet Bloc(old USSR + other Iron Curatin nations)<br />

I've seen a few scenarios on the topic but they suck. I was talking about a war in the european threatre with an overhaul of new units and stuff.  I've got all kinds of great ideas but so far can't get them too work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andrew Livings</div><div class="date">Apr 19, 2001, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the sort of thing you're after would be a &quot;Red Storm&quot; style scenario, set in the late 1980s with the USSR as the aggressor. Maybe like a reverse Red Front? Use the European map out of Ansteig (I like that one) and have two/three different scenario files (basically just a balancing thing).<br />
<br />
1. Human plays NATO, computer plays USSR. USSR has massive advantage in initial units and event-generated/re-generated units.<br />
<br />
2. Human plays USSR, computer plays NATO. NATO has massive initial units and event generated/re-generated units. A real test of tactical skill to achieve all the objectives.<br />
<br />
3. A more balanced/historically accurate (hah!) scenario for either FW hotseat or multiplayer: humans play both sides.<br />
<br />
But why? As the point was made in the SLeague forums not so long ago, we might love civ, but there better games for tactical wargaming. Plus this would merely adopt some of the design concepts of Red Front, simply transposed to a different time and place.<br />
<br />
You see, I have been thinking about this as an extension to my Atomic Age modpack, but I'm afraid my forte is global scenarios, and I like building scenarios above simple wargaming ones.<br />
<br />
Dreadnought (more specifically): sorry I didn't reply to this sooner. You can find all (well some; all the decent ones) of my scenarios on my site: http://members.nbci.com/HistCiv2/index.htm <br />
<br />
Plus I hope everyone here has looked at my Crises of the New World Order scenario. That quickly degenerates into global bloodshed (a civ2 flaw, say I, which I'm trying to get around).<br />
