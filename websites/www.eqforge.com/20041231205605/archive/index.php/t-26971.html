<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scrimshaw</div><div class="date">Jul 12, 2002, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 2 machines running networked in my room right now.  Until recently both ran fine.  The one I'm using now still works fine but my other one just won't work<br />
<br />
It was a Celeron 600mhz, 194mb of RAM, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
The problem started about a week back.  I'd boot it and when it got to windows all would be fine for about 30 seconds and then without warning it would reboot.  No error message, noise, nothing. What I found odd was that I could boot in safe mode just fine so I figured for sure it was a software problem with some background app that wasn't loading in safe mode and causing it to reboot.<br />
<br />
A few days later it decided not to turn on at all.  I'd hit the power button and all the lights(HD, Power and Cd) on the case come on, the monitor gets no input, the cd-rom drive won't eject and even the power button doesn't work anymore.  I have to cut the power to turn it off.<br />
<br />
At first I thought maybe just my video card is messed up but the lights come on.  Then I realized it won't shut off and it won't effect the cd-rom drive.  I then suspected my power supply.  It Might still be that but I would think the lights wouldn't be on and it wouldn't turn on at all.  Could be some kind of mainboard and/or CPU trouble but I really don't know at this point.<br />
<br />
I'm out of ideas as to what it is.  I plan to take it to a repair dude to have them deal with it but I'm curious if anybody has any ideas before I do.  I just like to have some more ideas before I talk to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jul 13, 2002, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, put you hand behind the power supply exhaust on the back of your case.  Do you feel an airflow (e.g., is the fan working at full speed?)?  <br />
<br />
Next, open up your case and take a look at two things.... the cooling fan on your CPU and the cooling fan on your Video card.   <br />
<br />
This has strong symptoms of a CPU (or video processor) overheat.  If true, there is also a strong possibility that your CPU (or video processor) is now ruined.  :(<br />
<br />
Hope there is just a bad fan &amp; no actual damage.  Do not run your machine for extended periods until you verify it is definitely not a cooling issue.   This exact same problem can also occur if your cooling heatsink/fan separates or pops off.... but that's unlikely since you did not move the machine immediately before the sudden change occurred.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you machine is older, run a lot, or in a dusty environment, it can also be lint &amp; dirt in you power supply (or on the cooling fans, causeing one or more to slow down or stop).   I take my machines apart once a year and clean them, including the Power Supply (don't do that if you're not good with hardware, or if your warranty would be voided).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scrimshaw</div><div class="date">Jul 13, 2002, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My power supply fan does appear to be operating just a little weaker than usual.  Damn I checked it but figured it was running and was good.  I just compared to my second machine and it's a fair bit stronger.<br />
<br />
I know my video processor is good.  I actually swapped video cards when I first thought it was a video card issue.  <br />
<br />
CPU Cooling fan was the first thing I checked when I looked at when I opened it to try another video card.  It's going at full speed.  Fully latched on too.  Not loose or anything.<br />
<br />
Could be a fried cpu.  Maybe the damn heat up here.  Last few weeks we've steadily had like 45 degree celcius heat after humidity.  On a cool day we get over 35 degree and low humidity.  Isn't Canada supposed to be cold!?<br />
<br />
I have no warranty anyway so I may take up cleaning my power supplies too now.  It was something I never really thought of doing.</div></div><hr />
