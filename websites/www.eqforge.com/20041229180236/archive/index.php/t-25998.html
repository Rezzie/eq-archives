<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andyo</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2002, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">does anyone know of a program which can join 2 avi files into one, or to split one large avi file into 2 smaller ones?<br />
example - lets say hypothetically you download a movie (spiderman)* in 3 avi files - is there any way to join them together to form one large file?<br />
conversly, let say you download one huge avi or mpeg file (hypothetically, l.o.t.r.)*which comes in two files too large to burn onto a cd - is there a way to break it up?<br />
<br />

* note - i neither support nor condone the download of movie or other material from the internet, as it is both morally wrong and illegal</div></div><hr />

thanks again for your help, as always</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2002, 02:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No problem, esse.  All the stuff you need to know about splitting and joining avi files is in their FAQ, but if you need any help with it, you know where to find me.<br />
<br />
Personally, I like Virtual Dub.  It's pretty easy to use and runs on very little computer resources.  There are far more powerful applications for video editing out there, but unless you're in the business of creating avis for distribution, this simple program is all you need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2002, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That looks like a good program!   Certainly has a nice price :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2002, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Free is a damn good price. I like programmers a lot :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lostman</div><div class="date">Jul 10, 2002, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">XP has Windows Movie Maker that does it.  It's crap and not worth the bytes it's stored on (does that make any sence?).<br />
<br />
So ya, I just wasted a post.  Sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey indeed, there's such a free program called AVIjoin and/or AVIsplitter... I have them.<br />
<br />
Edit: finally did you get my reply to your PM? since I couldn't see you &quot;there&quot;, so I didn't know whether you succeeded to make &quot;it&quot; work or not</div></div><hr />
