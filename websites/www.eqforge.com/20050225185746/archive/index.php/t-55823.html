<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 13, 2003, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In this thread (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?threadid=55788) the science ministry presented a detailed science plan involving building a complete trade network and completing the necessary improvements in Dou. The tax rate (50% science, 30% lux, 20% tax) would not change but as before the president would have the authority to fine tune this.<br />
<br />
The Ministry of Domestic Affairs (MoDA) supports this plan. Therefore there will be no detailed plan from MoDA this time as recently has been the case. A list of additional things to do if the opportunity arises may be presented later in a different poll after I have taken a more detailed look at Tim's plan (in particular, it would be nice if it were possible to accelerate Shake's and Dou's sewer, build a stock exchange in Dou and get a settler or two).</div></div><hr />
