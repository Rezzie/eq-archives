<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CornMaster</div><div class="date">Jan 01, 2001, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone want to help me do a ST Mod?  I've got the units graphics done (but not the stats).  And can probably handle the tech tree (although I need help).  What I don't/can't do is edit the improvements and wonders.  I hate doing this.  I also have a bunch of sounds (I think) for the ships and weapons.  I've got the terrain done but it could use some reworking.  This will be my 4th!!!  attempt at a Star Trek MOD!!!  My first one was ok but I handed it off to someone else who finished it.  The next one was just sad.  My 3rd attempt was the basis for this try.  I took terrain from the first and second tries and redid the unit graphics.  Added more races units and expanded the map but never finished it.  (Quit about 8-10 months ago)  But I'd like to give it another go.  It won't be a scenario as such, but just a totally different Civ 2 game.  Although I will make scenarios after based on this MOD.  The tech tree will be tricky but the rest is just teadious and I can't handle it all.<br />
<br />
Any takers??<br />

Programming mods is my specialty and I have a special place in my heart for Star Trek mods! I can also help with sounds if you need them.<br />

I can send the units.gif file.  That's where all my work has gone.  I'll see what else I can find on my backup disks.  I wasn't expecting a response so soon. I plan to have the computer back in a few days.  So I'll be able to work full force then.<br />

<br />
Peace,<br />

I installed Civ 2 this morning.  HAve more stuff to install before I can actually start working on the MOD.  But I want to discuss all the ideas I have written up so far.  Do you have ICQ?  If not, know anywhere we can chat and send images?  I got units, tech tree, and improvments figured out for the Borg.  Got most weapons figured out and some ships but I need help with the improvments and the intermingling tech tree.  For example....only Federation, Klingon, and Romulans can research Warp but Romulan must get it later 5th or 6th compared 2nd or 3rd for Fed and Kling.  And cloak is similar. 3rd or 4th for Rom and 7th or 8th for Klingons but they can't get each others tech after.  Going to be a challenge!!  But I'm up for it.  Each race is going to have limited units and tech's so it will be cool!!!!<br />
<br />
But I need to talk to you JValdezToo!!!!<br />

<br />
I'm here for ya, buddy! Tell ya what I'll do...I'll log onto ICQ and get a screen name and we can chat...not this weekend but next weekend we can spend long hours working out the details....I am going to say this, I would highly recommend giving some of the techs to Romulans, Klingons and Federation ahead of time...this might be an opportunity for starting this scenario in a particular war situation....say the Kittamer Massacre or Federation Espionage in the Neutral Zone...<br />
<br />
The story line is going to affect the goals of tech research...also, keep in mind you can just assign techs and slow the research of techs down so much that no one can get techs &quot;except through conquest&quot;. That solves all the problems of determining how to assign techs to be researched by who...<br />
<br />
You can email me at: <br />
<br />
JValdezToo@yahoo.com<br />
<br />
I'll get ICQ asap!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
