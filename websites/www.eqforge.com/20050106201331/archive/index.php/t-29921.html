<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Narz</div><div class="date">Aug 16, 2002, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I was 15, many years ago, I thought of an idea for a war game, which I wrote down on paper.  At the time, my programing skills were very limited so I had no way to transfer my idea from paper to reality.<br />
<br />
Recently, I download a BASIC simulator for me and realize my &quot;programing skills&quot; are even worse than they once were.  Still I am somewhat inspired and was wondering if anyone could tell me what they think is the best language to make a game like this.<br />
<br />
The gist of the game was this, you control a nation and you have to conquer the other nations to win.  You have to build your army and keep your peasants happy.  Its very similar (although not exactally like) Nobunaga's Ambition, a NES (Nintendo) game.<br />
<br />
I have included the game plan for download, please note it is basically unaltered since its inception 8 years ago.  I will probably update it and make it more interesting as soon as I have hope that I may actually be able to make it.  When I can actually &quot;test-drive&quot; it, see how the computer controled countries interact with the player and each other, that will be a happy day for me and I'm sure will lead to much improvement.  I sincerely hope no one steals my idea.  Take care all.  Thanks for all comments!<br />

It hard to learn though. Still I know most gamed are writen in it, so you should look at that i gusee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Aug 20, 2002, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Forth is surely the most enjoyable programming language.  However, Narz, you must do everything yourself, and that tends to take the fun out of it for most people.  You are a seeker of wisdom, and there is real wisdom in Forth.  For example, the compiler is only 1K, and fits on the old successful spacecraft to Mars and such.<br />
<br />
Google search Forth DirectX came up with a few options.<br />
<br />
But I'd imagine C/C++ has the most support and examples.</div></div><hr />

Definitely can't use it now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Aug 20, 2002, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I learned on Basic, GE Timesharing basic.  It's a fine language to learn on, or at least, it was.  A key feature of Basic is that is integrated with the computer it lives on -- so commands to work with file directories, or graphics to draw a line or circle or color, all work without the vast complexity that normally attends modern languages.<br />
<br />
To learn to program, one must visualize a task, complete it, and be sure you have coded to prevent all bugs.  Games are very good, when you can get someone else to play them with you, because everyone is keeping score, and all bugs are identified.  In &quot;The Sole of a New Machine&quot; this was noted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tSlater</div><div class="date">Aug 21, 2002, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first thing I learned for PC programming was TGF/MMF ( www.clickteam.com ) They're programming tools without a language.. so basically all you have to do is learn concepts and ways to get programs/games running (although TGF and MMF also provide a few things which make programming a lot faster and easier.  You don't need to program your own display engine.)  You don't need to learn any language to accomplish things.  They also make Jamagic which is relatively new.. Jamagic is technically an interpreter but in short.. it is a programming language.  It is more powerful than TGF/MMF, but also requires you to learn a language.  (But because it is from the makers of TGF/MMF, the language isn't too difficult to learn, and there are some things which Jamagic does which is really nice.  Like with arrays.  With other languages I've seen, once you create an array and define its size, you're stuck with that size.  With Jamagic, you can create an array without defining its size and continue to add more to it.  Although things do go a little faster if you define an array size before-hand.)</div></div><hr />

FWIW, most programming lnaguages I've used have at least allowed dynamic memory allocation, if not specifically dynamic arrays.  I've been a professional programmer for 20+ years, and I've rarely run into a situation where I needed a dynamic array that I couldn't make one.</div></div><hr />
