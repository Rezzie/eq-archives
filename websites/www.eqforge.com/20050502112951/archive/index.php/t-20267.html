<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 14, 2002, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've made a working submission form, but Thunderfall is afraid I'll get bogus submissions through this, because people will try to see how it works. Yet I think a warning to prevent this is sufficient. ;)<br />
<br />
But take a look yourself. Don't try this one as well, cos I'll get spam then. ;) It's just to show how it looks...<br />
http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3gotm/civ3gotm_submit.shtml<br />
<br />
Reason I want this is because it's annoying to have to figure out what everyone's score is because everyone is mentioning it in a different way to me. And still some just don't mention it at all and I have to mail back to read the rules. But now, what do you think of it?<br />
<br />
Edit: changed the URL to the working submission form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Apr 14, 2002, 03:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The form looks like it would be easy for us to use.  If you think it'll make your job easier why not try it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trash</div><div class="date">Apr 14, 2002, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks good matrix. Anything to help you save time is good in my book. You do a awesome job running this thing. The results are always up so quick i'm amazed :)<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Apr 15, 2002, 03:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks good.  Perhaps you could do a check on the savegame submission - if there is no file attached, erase the whole submission (although let the submitter know...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 15, 2002, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Filtering false submissions won't be any problem. If someone didn't send me a valid savegame - and I can check with a very small program whether a file is in fact a Civ3 savegame and if it has been edited with Civ3MultiTool - the submission ends up in the trash can.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunderfall</div><div class="date">Apr 15, 2002, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new submit pages and script are uploaded. I had to put the script in the cgi-bin to make it work (and thus had to change some links on the pages). Besides that it works like a charm.  :)  Good work on the form!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldasar</div><div class="date">Apr 16, 2002, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah.. It looks great... :) It will make it easier...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2002, 07:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks great, but more importantly: works great! :D I helps me a lot making the results!! :yeah:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rain</div><div class="date">Apr 22, 2002, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice form and I would use it BUT whenever it try to send email to a link on this site my ISp rejects it saying it wont allow redirects, so i have to use hotmail to send my results unless you can suggest something I may be doing incorrectly. :egypt:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 25, 2002, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You shouldn't use the link above, but the page on the GOTM site. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rain</div><div class="date">Apr 25, 2002, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes i did try that one. Its not related to the form its my silly isp.</div></div><hr />
