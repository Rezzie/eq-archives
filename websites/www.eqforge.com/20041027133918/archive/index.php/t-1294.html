Comments and Feedback please. I will also give tips and hints here (when asked) until the strategy guide is posed at Art of War.<br />
<br />
Anyone who can complete at Admiral Level or better please post here as well for recognition. I myself have only completed at Commodore Level.</div></div><hr />

Maybe I'll give feedback to myself. Does anyone know how to make the AI fire quantum torpeodes at anything other than photon artillery and Sovereigns located in fortress squares?</div></div><hr />

I just think it takes very long to move all those units when you play the Dominion, and I wasn't able to use some of the torpedo units because they were to far away.<br />
<br />
Kobayashi? You play ST: Armada allright. KOBAYASHIMARU<br />
<br />
By the way. I've made severale new units from screenshots of ST: Armada. Are you interested? <br />

I played the Armada campaign to the end but it seemed to be a star-craft clone and crashed every once in a while so I never tried multi-player.<br />
<br />
I only use the kobayashi handle when I play Homeworld/Cataclysm. That is the definitive real time strategy game for me. Ships may not be trek but they are true 3-D and the variety of tactics is much greater. Some people were making a star trek mod at one time but they gave up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Mar 06, 2001, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. Armada is buggy allright. But KOBAYASHIMARU is a cheat in ST: Armada. You win the level if you type it. (after the enter button). I never played Armada multiplayer either. I hadn't played the game for a few months until now (for the units). I must say, the graphics are really cool if you make a screenshot in Armada, convert it to 256 colours and then put it in Civ II. Thanks! You gave me the idea! Though, I wonder. Did you visit the ST DS9: Dominion Wars site?<br />

Lots of &quot;goals&quot; to accomplish and a real feeling of space!  By all means, make more of these!<br />
<br />
And, yet, I'm bummed.  A couple of turns after accomplishing a particular goal, the game crashed (some page fault error).  I went to my last save and tried again, of course, and the same thing happened.  I then started an entirely new game and . . . yep, a couple of turns after that same goal, CRASH!<br />
<br />
Am I the only one experiencing this?  I would really like to finish this game!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Mar 06, 2001, 11:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah - were you playing as the Dominion?<br />
<br />
About the crash: It's the first I've come across, sorry about that. I'm no expert about these things. It's unlikely to be a corrupted file since Civ typically crashes at the start when there is even something slightly wrong.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a version problem. For starters, are you using FW or MGE and what version number? Maybe thunderfall can help you.</div></div><hr />

Well, yeah. I played the Federation first, ofcourse. But after that I played the Dominion. Something weird about that?<br />
<br />
I never tested it from the Dominion side. The game is not balenced for the other races. The Dominion gets many warships via events, and has a HUGE advantage with a human player. It should be easy to win as the Dominion. Did you complete it? And if so, do you remember on what turn? I'm just curious about it. <br />

To be honest, I haven't played it for about five days because I'm working on my own modpack/scenario. It was easy until now. I easily destroyed incoming Federation ships (and Klingon, too). And nearby planets hadn't got a single unit on them very soon. I &quot;skipped Deep Space 9 until now. I wasted a few good units on it. I have a few Quantum Torpedoes that are &quot;stuck&quot; in a part of my territory, so I can't use them. Maybe I'll go on playing this afternoon.<br />

<br />
You should also tell us all which turn that the game is crashing...<br />
<br />
I would also like to add that you should shut down all other programs while playing the scenario, there might be something that conflicts with your civ game...<br />
<br />
Also, try turning off the music when you play. I know this doesn't sound like it means much but I've found that (interestingly enough) on MGE, it makes a difference sometimes.<br />
<br />
If you have access to FW, I would recommend playing this scenario on FW. <br />
<br />
Let us know the details for your game.<br />

With regards to details on your game. Since you researched everything, it must be late in the scenario. Just out of interest, how many battleships did you kill and typically what did you use to kill them? Quite suprised to hear that you are going through the wormhole without finishing off the Cardies first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunderfall</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2001, 09:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">oops sorry. I will correct it asap. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/eek.gif</div></div><hr />

<br />
By the way. I'm playing it at commodore level now (that's high for me). I'm doing quite well, I must say. I reconquered Bajor and Betazed (those were the only planets I lost, including another that was destroyed (between Bajor and Vulcan))'. I control the wormhole on both sides, I conquered the two Dominion planets most far away fom the WH (in the gamma q), and I conquered a few Cardassian planets. But nothing has changed really for 30 turns. I've researched everything, and the Klingons are almost finished by the Romulans. This is not a complain. I am just telling a little story.<br />

The other ships have different functions but I think you need to build all of them to be sucessful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Mar 14, 2001, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. The Cardassian are a far more greater danger than the Dominion. The Dominion just attack and die near Bajor. The Cardassians attack Betazed, and die about 50% of the time. I keep sending Sovereign-class vessels from Earth, Andor, Delta and a few other planets as reinforcements. I have send a large fleet (20 Sovereigns) three times already. The first one was the most succesfull. It conquered three Cardassian planets, and showed up at Cardassia with five ships, but they all died and two of the planets were reconquered. The second was just a big disaster. It didn't even conquer one planet. It was surprised by about seven of those new Galor-class ships, and then by a lot of torpedos (strange, 'cause they don't use them if you're standing near the gates of their planet). The third was quite succesful, one Cardassian planet and two Dominion planets were conquered. But as for now, I have to watch my defence in Betazed.<br />

They're very strong. And I don't want to change production, so I sed a lot of Sovereigns to f.e. Betazed as reinforcements, realise that there are twenty sovereigns thare,l take fifteen, and go out to conquer a Cardassian planet.<br />
