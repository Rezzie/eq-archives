In general I like the music in Civ3, but I almost dread the Modern Age just because of that darn sax playing...OVER and OVER...   Gag!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tetley</div><div class="date">Jan 03, 2002, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I have tremendous respect for those who play their musical instruments well, including Kenny G.  That takes lots of time to get good at it.  I just hate that one musical score.  I don't know, something about amassing 50 Modern Armor and steamrolling everybody, all to that tune of, &quot;la la la la la la...&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Ancient: that one drum song is good [dance] <br />

I wonder if there is a way to somehow insert your own MP3's. I'm thinking make the title the same as a civ song and replace it. Hmmmmmm, maybe.</div></div><hr />

And you can alt-tab to other applications. So, once you have the game loaded, turn the game music off, pop in a CD, and listen to whatever you want.</div></div><hr />

Go into the folder :<br />
Civ 3\Sounds\Diplomusic<br />
There you just have to change the mp3 in it with the ones you want and voilà.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neo Guderian</div><div class="date">Jan 04, 2002, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">simply go to the folder that has the music and copy your own files there renaming them as the old files.  I did this with the star wars imperial march. no better tune for building empires =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pagh80</div><div class="date">Jan 04, 2002, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or you can do this:  Open your MP3 player and start the music you want to hear. Next open civ3 dissable the music and play the game. Works fine for me with the MP3 player playing in the background and no stop in the music nor in the game... Thats just as easy:p</div></div><hr />

There are a lot of songs in which I think the &quot;music&quot; would be great for a &quot;war theme&quot; or &quot;peace time theme&quot;, but would rather do without the vocals. I went in search and found this program. I haven't tried it yet, as I am at work, but... I will tonight, if anyone has time before that, maybe they could download it and let the rest of us know how it works.  Here's an excerpt from the site.<br />
<br />
 &quot;YoGen Vocal Remover is a standalone (not a plug-in) program that removes vocals from PCM WAV files under Windows 95/98/2000/NT 4.0, and allows you to save vocal removed files to disk. This software tries to remove any monophonic components from stereo music. So, the quality of removal depends on how songs are recorded and mixed. Some songs work great, while others do not. &quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know if PCM WAV is a fancy name for standard WAV files or not, anyone know???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zebomba</div><div class="date">Jan 04, 2002, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Either replace the old mp3 with diff ones with the old names, or just hit the &quot;windows&quot; key so you can access your desktop and play cds, mp3s or whatever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Psychlone</div><div class="date">Jan 04, 2002, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Divis, yeah, a PCM Wav file is a standard wav. And that does sound like a handy little program, thanks for pointing it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Divis</div><div class="date">Jan 05, 2002, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Where are the files for the BG Music, I changed all the GDDM music for diplomatic screen music, not BG, Anyone know where it is?<br />
<br />
BTW, the program that I posted before... I tried it and didn't like it. I only tried it for one song, so maybe that's why, but... Other people might like it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">docceh</div><div class="date">Jan 05, 2002, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having music running in the background from winamp is what I normally do. Works fine except for a little slowdown or &quot;lag&quot; occasionally, such as track changes but it's hardly noticeable.</div></div><hr />
