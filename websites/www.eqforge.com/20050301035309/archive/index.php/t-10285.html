<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">davedenis</div><div class="date">Nov 26, 2001, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I've had Civ2 Gold sitting around for quite awhile but never spent much time with it (no more than an hour or two).  I like it and want to get back in to it but now with Civ3 out, should I just shelve that and pick the new one up for Christmas and start there?  I'm just wondering if Civ3 basically delivers everything Civ2 did but all updated and new and better, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ApocalypseKurtz</div><div class="date">Nov 26, 2001, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Civ3 is definitely a better game; it has much improved graphics/sound over Civ2, better units, and lots of new options that make the game more fun.  I think you should try to sell Civ2 for a decent amount if possible and get started on Civ3.  Basically, as long as you don't actually SEE Civ3 being played, you won't miss anything.  But after seeing Civ3 you will not be able to go back to the inferior Civ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam_Catchem</div><div class="date">Nov 26, 2001, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK..I disagree.  Civ2 is worth the time.  It will only be fun though if you play it BEFORE you play civ3.  Civ3 is by far the better game..but Civ2 is worth playing and a heck of a lot of fun.  I played the heck out of it before Civ3 came along.  How many years was that?  It was like the only game I KEPT on my computer.  I got bored of everything else..but Civ2 was awesome.  Play it..and when you get good and like it..go to Civ3 and throw everyting you learned in Civ2 away!  Enjoy both!</div></div><hr />

I like civ3 much better cause of all the other aspects of the game.<br />
Its more challenging and a heck of a lot going on.<br />
Buy civ3, you will have more fun. Keep civ2 for when you want to go back to the &quot;old school&quot;Why worry when worry kills</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">davedenis</div><div class="date">Nov 26, 2001, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the real question for me is, is it worth the time playing Civ2 for however long when I can just start with Civ3 which is the better game from everyone's point of view.  It's not like playing Monkey Island 3 before playing 4, where there is a storyline.  I'd rather play Simcity 3000 than 2000 if I was just starting, right?  I'm guessing this is more like that situation.  It's not a big deal that I have Civ2 already, I'll give it to a buddy to play.</div></div><hr />
