<br />
I    Thou Shall not acquire polytheism or any of its derivatives.<br />
II   Thou Shall not be fundamentalist, or suffer alliances with fundamentalists.<br />
III Thou Shall not build a temple, cathedral, or coliseum or suffer one to stand in your territory.<br />
IV Thou Shall not acquire the Oracle, Michelangelo, or Bach; they must be burned.  <br />
<br />
I think this would be best in D+n. (all of the beautiful black hats :) )<br />
I, however lack the skills to code a D+n game. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stegyre</div><div class="date">Oct 05, 2004, 08:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For starting black hats, you actually want D+2 or higher.  D+1 (my favorite level) gives you starting red hats.  The &quot;coding&quot; is easy - even I, the English Major, could do it.  <br />
<br />
(1) Make a backup of the relevant file.  Save it as x.bkp, where x is the name of the file.  You should always do this if you've never edited a file before, and even if you know what you are doing, it is a wise practice.<br />
<br />
(2) Open the relevant .txt file (I believe it is in rules.txt but it could be menu.txt or something else) and add extra lines after deity.  It should look something like this:<br />
<br />
Chieftain (easiest)<br />
Prince<br />
King<br />
Emperor<br />
Deity (hardest)<br />
Adept   ; (Deity+1; these are now added levels)<br />
Elite     ; (Deity+2)<br />
Oh, Cr@p!  ;  (Deity+3)<br />
<br />
(3) After making the changes, close the file and save the changes.<br />
<br />
(4) You can test if you have done it correctly by starting up Civ2 and seeing if the extra levels appear when you are invited to select the difficulty level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prof. Garfield</div><div class="date">Oct 05, 2004, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The file you want is the GAME file.  If you go into mycomputer etc. untill you get into the civilization file, it will apear as a notebook file, but it will open into word.  While you are at it, you may want to add a level of barbarity, but only one level!  I don't think that you can avoid the thechs that you may want to, and, out of curiosity, why would we not be allowed to build colosseums?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TemporalAnomaly</div><div class="date">Oct 05, 2004, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think that you can avoid the thechs that you may want to, and, out of curiosity, why would we not be allowed to build colosseums?<br />
<br />
Coliseums produce tithes in fundy, so I think of them as quasi-religious.<br />
<br />
The Techs (poly, mono, theo, fundy) lead nowhere, so we don't need them. As you point out though, it may be difficult if not impossible to exterminate the AI without winning  them. So if nobody has any brilliant ideas about killing the AI safely, we should think of the techs not as an absolute limit, but huge style points.<br />
<br />
Who is in? <br />
I am open to suggestion as to the exact starting specs, but I think there would be a certain poetry to us being the Mongols.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Specialist290</div><div class="date">Oct 05, 2004, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A minor note: You can only do D+n and &quot;Barb Wrath&quot; in Classic/2.42. Of course, (and this saying has become something of my catch line, like &quot;You're Fired!&quot; for Donald Trump) I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Despite my relative lack of experience at such levels, I'd participate.<br />
<br />
And yes, given the situation, the Mongols seem like an appropriate choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be interesting watching a couple of guys like us (with no skills at D+n levels) take this on all on our lonesome, and even more interesting to be one of them ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I tryed a few (hundred) turns of a D+4 game last night. I noticed no bugs, execpt that the captial city has D+0 happyness when it is not suporting a military unit.<br />
<br />
Will you do the honours?<br />
<br />
Diff = D+4<br />
Barbs = Scourge of God<br />
Size = Large Map<br />
Land mass = Large <br />
Arch.<br />
Warm<br />
Wet<br />
7 Civs: Rome, Greese, Egypt, Babylon, China, ?????, Mongolia (us)<br />
<br />
<br />
Play 20 turns<br />
The big boys can join in latter if they want.<br />

As you will notice we have a bit of a nice stating position, and the int'l date line is only 2 west. :)<br />
<br />
// May the force be with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Specialist290</div><div class="date">Oct 06, 2004, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, this will be interesting (particularly for a guy like me who's never made a serious attempt at anything higher than Prince.) Downloading now.<br />
<br />
(Incidentally, my 'Net and my Civ2 are on 2 different comps (my dad doesn't like me wasting storage space on his computer), so it may take a tad bit longer than expected while I transfer between the two.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmmm some thoughts though -- I think the early landing strats will have to be explored;  perhaps an OCC.  Make friends and try your best to keep them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prof. Garfield</div><div class="date">Oct 07, 2004, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll play, and I think that we should go for early Republic, not monarchy, because we cannot get mikes anyway, and the blackies will be opressive without lots of lux, so build by the coast, or make a road near the city for the extra trade we'll need.<br />
As I understand it, we are allowed to reserch the 'Theisms, but for &quot;stile&quot; we want to avoid them.  Is that correct?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TemporalAnomaly</div><div class="date">Oct 07, 2004, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Prof. Garfield: Do you to take your turn after Specialist290 ?<br />
<br />
By Style I mean the game will probibly force us to take them off any thechnologicly backwards enemy we conquer, and I don't see this turning into early landing  game.<br />
<br />
I agree about the early republic, and I don't think we will have a shot at any of the early worders and propibly the renasance. I think our early goals should be:<br />
<br />
1. Republic<br />
2. Seafaring<br />
3. Sanitation<br />
4. 20 cities<br />
<br />
Once we biuld #19 all citzens will start as black hats , so we will be able to get size 20 -40 cites easyer than the easyer than on the D - n levels.<br />
Because we will have such easy happiness (once we get there), Domocrasy may not be the only choice. Power Commie could be interesting. :)</div></div><hr />

We may not be able to avoid techs though, either through huts, or if the comp gives us only one in the selection of techs for reserch.<br />
Your goals are slightly off.  We should go for Republic, then Trade etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TemporalAnomaly</div><div class="date">Oct 08, 2004, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah Trade, but isn't that your answer to everything. :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Trade &gt;&gt; Industrialzation<br />
Trade &gt;&gt; Wheel<br />
Trade &gt;&gt; Fission<br />
Trade &gt; Republic (close)<br />
Trade = Democracy (maybe)<br />
<br />
For future referance don't try OCOCC on D+5 on a large map. I was doing nicely at 1320 with Supperhighways, Newton, Copernicus, Darwin, UN, the Eifle Tower(by mistake) and almost enough freight for Applo and the SS, but Greece, after spending an age in fundy, suddenly decided to make peace with every one and go demo. They were getting 2+ advances per turn.  :cry: So much for the space race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prof. Garfield</div><div class="date">Oct 08, 2004, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was taught well in the lessons of trade in CFC.  As for your story about the Greeks, I was playing diety a while ago (one of my first times) and I was nicely established on an island (playing as English, ironicaly) and the larger Vikings were in fundy, so I was in the tech lead.  Then they switched to republic and started teching their way ahead.  I still got my SS to alfa first, so it wasn't that bad, but I know the feeling.  That position was also where I learned the value of submarines, and how their useful against opponents with lots of cruise missles.</div></div><hr />

3: Move settler.<br />
<br />
4: Move settler.<br />
<br />
5: Move settler onto hut: :eek: BARBARIAN HORSE* :eek: Switch production in Karakorum to warrior.<br />
<br />
6: Loose settlers to barb horse. Warrior build, causing disorder in karakorum, change prod to settlers.  Moved settler out of city, but doesn't restor order.<br />
<br />
7: Disorder, Move warrior into city.<br />
<br />
8: Disorder.<br />
<br />
9: Disorder.<br />
<br />
10: Barb Horse loosed to Warrior (vet)**, disorder, explore with warrior.<br />
<br />
11: Alfabet, go for code of laws. Disorder, change citisen to elvis, to restor order as city grew next turn.<br />
<br />
12: Order in Karakorum, size 2.  Explore.<br />
<br />
13-20: Explore.<br />
<br />
*This apperently means that the first 16 turns are not &quot;barb proof&quot;<br />
**This was planned.  I knew from this site that if you only have one city, and it is attacked by barbs, if the city is defended, the barb will die.<br />
<br />
Notes: There is a whales tile near the warrior, we should settle near it soon.  It will be for my successor to decide weather it should go there imediately, or wate untill the next city pops out a settler.  If it is possible to build a settler while Karakorum is still size one when we still don't have another city, do so.  I don't expect this to be the case, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TemporalAnomaly</div><div class="date">Oct 09, 2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Change tax rate to 0.4.6 and have elvis work the sea, getting us as many beaker as before (1) and an extra food.<br />

2 Explore<br />
<br />
3 Pop Hut: 50G<br />

4 - 7 Explore<br />
<br />
8 Pop Hut (near Karakorum): 25G<br />
  Pop Hut (West): Nomad  :D  Send nomad to cape of whales.<br />
<br />
9 Explore<br />
 <br />
10 Code of Laws go for Writing: 30 turns ouch! Stack of Babylonian wariors wanders over (two squares from our great capital)  :( <br />
<br />
11 Babylon makes contact: Demands CoL; we give. We ask for alliance; They give. Beg; get pottery; (Writing now in 48)  :( <br />
<br />
12 Find Babylonian city of Ur. Greeks make contact: Demand 50G; we give. Ask for peace; they give. Ask for alliance; They demand pottery; we give; they give. Beg; get map making.<br />
<br />
13 Settler complete. Disorder. Tax to 0.6.4 making one beaker by working the grassland.<br />
<br />
14 Settler starts road east of Capital. Nomab starts road south of future city on cape.<br />
<br />
15 Explore, Disorder<br />
<br />
16 Roads complete Tax at 4.0.6 for 1G + 1B.<br />
<br />
17 Samarkand founded on Cape of whales(disorder)<br />
<br />
18 AI starts building wonders (Lighthouse and Prymids?). China starts war with Baylon (we stay out of it). Barb uprising in the far west. (hopfuly wont affect us) <br />
<br />
19 Uprising turns out to be a lone archer and a leader (we have a warior near by)  :) <br />
<br />
20 Contact Babylon: they demand map making; we give. Beg: get Cerimonial burial (I don't think Greece has it yet  :)  ). Found Bokhara near Karakorum. <br />
<br />
So all told we now have 3 size 1 cities all in disorder (Karakorum will grow next turn though), Two allies, and three tech to go until republic.   :sad: <br />
<br />
'290, you have 20 turns; take it away!</div></div><hr />

 :joke: <br />
 <br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/Map.GIF<br />
<br />
City Ideas:<br />
<br />
1) It may overlap with  Bokhara, but it would be easy to found and suffer little coruption, and may be the only place we get a shot at on the Babylonian border.<br />
<br />
2) I am almost certain this is a multiple special spot.<br />
<br />
3 &amp; 4) Both nice spots on the coast; 4 propibly has multiple specials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prof. Garfield</div><div class="date">Oct 09, 2004, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty good.  The alliances give us a chance to beg.  Try to exchange maps.  Remember that cities in disorder still produce science, but that is not reflected in the tax rate view (though it is counted in the science advisor menu, and it is 24 turns).  With luck, one of our allies will discover republic and gift it to us, that would save some time in reserch.</div></div><hr />

If all goes well, I should have my turns in by late tomorrow/early Monday. Tuesday at the very latest.<br />

(That should give me time to mentally and emotionally condition myself ;) )</div></div><hr />
