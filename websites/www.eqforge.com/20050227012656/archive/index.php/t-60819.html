<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Aug 06, 2003, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has been suggested that we should build a canal city in Hell. Two locations have been suggested, between Knossos/Corinth/Delphi (C1 and C2) and between Athens/Sparta (C3).<br />
<br />
Also the Ministry of Domestic Affairs (MoDA) wants to start constructing a road/railroad from Hell to Barbaria ASAP. This is a project that takes a lot of time so the sooner we start the better. The MoDA suggests dedicating one engineer to this taks immediately and more once we have built some infrastructure (railroads, irrigation) in Hell. Also the engineer should be escorted by a diplomat and cavalry because we could run into hostile troops or even cities. The diplomat/cavalry could also explore this area to check for the presence of French cities. Starting by constructing a road seems to make sense and to build railroad later when we have more engineers for this task. Needless to say we would later found cities in this area unless there are French cities there.<br />

It has been pointed out that it would be useful to have a coastal city in southern Africa. To this end, the city of Bapedi could be relocated, it is of size 1 so it could immediately rush buy an engineer.<br />

<br />
Finally, we need a name for the area N/NW of China. Since in reality Siberia is N/NW of China we could use that name but I suggest replacing the first two letters and calling this province Cyberia. We could then found cities there and use names like Internet, World Wide Web, Dotcom and even Crash :D. More suggestions are welcome, both for naming this province and for naming future cities there.</div></div><hr />

Whats wrong with Barbaria? If you are referring to why not to call the area I called &quot;Cyberia&quot; above Barbaria the answer is that Barbaria is a smaller area around Berlin and Berlin Barbfarm etc.<br />
<br />
See a map of the provinces in this thread (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=58388)<br />
<br />
Cyberia would be the province between Barbaria and Hell (N/NW of China).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I voted no to the canals (I've now looked up the difference between Channel and Canal:) ), but one canal we maybe should consider is the one leading into the big lake of China. Maybe it's not first priority, but it could help us once we declare war on the Chinese.<br />
<br />
I voted we should start building this road. However, it's more than 20 squares to the mountain with the knight on, and the terrain is quite rough in some areas. This means that it will take more than 60 yrs to complete with 3 engineers. We could set some engineers to build the road between them, but not build the railroad until Hell is developed enough to spare the engineers needed.</div></div><hr />

I simply can't understand why you guys disband cities :lol:  On the other hand, at least Bapedi is only Size=1 now.  Don't waste your time writing why, btw, I can see the way this vote and many others in the past have gone.  I just wanted to gripe once.<br />
<br />
The canal city I recommend is Mined Hill 3NE of Eretria.  It connects Superstorms to China, two vast oceans.  Athens and Corinth can build military to ship along the new railroad we're going to build.</div></div><hr />
