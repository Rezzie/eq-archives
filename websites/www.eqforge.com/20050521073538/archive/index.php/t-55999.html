<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vote Rik Meleet.<br />
He has done an outstanding job in Gorina. He deserves your support. So please vote Rik</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 01:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vote for me. :) <br />
<br />
I will try to improve the citys in this province by building infrastructure and not that many military units. This province will eventually have our largest and most productive citys. This is my goal. I also hope to build or best harbours here...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our Western Province is going to be an important province. It has a diversity of land-types and recources and has a lot of coast. It will also be close to yet unknown seafaring savages who call themselves German, Babylon, Persia, China and Japan. I predict the Western Province will be the meeting ground of several of them, if not on land than certainly off our coasts. The geographical placement of the province will make other Civs view it as a landing-ground. I will make sure the will not view it that way for a long time. <br />
<br />
It is important to settle these lands quickly, but with brains. I intend to not blindly follow a dotmap or an &quot;optimal city placement&quot;, but use our ever increasing knowledge to gain the highest benefits from our lands. <br />
<br />
If we get lucky enough to claim all of the land I will make this in a cultural and economic region with harbors, markets and libraries.It's geographical location makes it ideal for and vulnerable to invasions. I will make it impenetrable for landing troops and if they do get an invasion force on our shores will throw them into our sea. When it's safe I will make it a jumping board for boats with settlers and troops. <br />
<br />
If we won't be lucky enough to claim all of the land I will make sure the savages are removed from our backdoor, either by force or by culture. the Western province must become our backdoor and I will keep it properly locked and flourishing. Our &quot;backgarden&quot; will be a region of great achievements and wealth. This will allow the other provinces focus on military, production and Wonders. <br />
<br />
The Western Province cannot really be a production-powerhouse region as it's cities are at best 2nd ring and most likely 3rd or 4th. But it can function as a military training ground for future wars as well. It's best designation is of as our cultural and economic heartland. <br />
<br />
Vote Rik Meleet for Governor of the Western Province and you will not be disappointed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 09:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will put it to vote, although I feel that this term should end on the 30th of this month.  Having one-month terms starting and ending at different times sounds like more trouble than it's worth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Term that this election shall cover is the remainder of the Second Term. At the end of the second Term, then an election shall be held to cover the next &quot;fixed&quot; Term, Term 3.</div></div><hr />

Thank you Mayor Cyc.  Shouldn't this information be part of the initial post?</div></div><hr />

I will be an active and listening Governor. I will make the Western Province a beautiful province. <br />
<br />
This requires hard work; which I have already started. I invite you all to the western province (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=56312) for a visit or as your home-province. We are a growing province with currently 2 towns; Nar Shadaa and needs-a-name-1. <br />
<br />
I will not disappoint you. <br />
<br />
Rik Meleet<br />
Governor of the Western province.</div></div><hr />
