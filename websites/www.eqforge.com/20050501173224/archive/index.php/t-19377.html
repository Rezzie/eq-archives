<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Mar 30, 2002, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thunderfall now always lets me make the new GOTM's. And I thought that it might be better to start the GOTM before it is released. That way I can see whether the map is fun or not and then I can also read the spoiler thread from the beginning without getting foreknowledge.<br />
<br />
Of course, I'll quit the game sooner than you, since it would be unfair to be able to play the game longer than you. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiga Merlin</div><div class="date">Mar 30, 2002, 01:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Matrix, you certainly can play the game ahead if you want.  I have no problem with it, but wouldn't you rather play the game with the rest of us?  GOTM5 was challenging, but everyone played the same game and it looks like most people enjoyed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taiga Merlin</div><div class="date">Mar 30, 2002, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK now that I read your post again I see I missed the point.  Yes go ahead and play before the rest of us.  It seems like a very good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Black Fluffy Lion</div><div class="date">Mar 30, 2002, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">good idea Matrix :)<br />
<br />
don't suppose you'd like to tell me what size map the next GOTM is on now... :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rain</div><div class="date">Mar 30, 2002, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">personally the notion of a difficult map is jsut part of the challenge. For example that last map while challenging was not unsurmountable and added to the game in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Mar 30, 2002, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The last map was hard, but fun too. ;) What I mean with a bad map is more like other than previous ones. If the next map has the same kind of starting position it will be tedious. But it won't happen often that I'll reject a map though.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the approval!</div></div><hr />
