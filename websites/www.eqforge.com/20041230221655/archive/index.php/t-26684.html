<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sumthinelse</div><div class="date">Jul 07, 2002, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is on the root of the C: drive, win2000. It has a bunch of .cab files and compressed files with extensions like .DL_ in it. I am tempted to move to to a cdrom or other drive to save space on the C: partition. I believe it is only used when I install some windows component, for example a network adapter driver, and then it would prompt me for the location anyway. It seems like a dumb idea to have all these install images taking up space on my C: drive....</div></div><hr />

Just be able to point  to it's path if you make system or setup changes.... it'll prompt you for the path.<br />
<br />
You can even write the contents to a CD-R.  :)  You can delete the \I386 directory from your C: once you have made a copy of it somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

You do not need to make a backup if you still have the original Win2000 CD as the folder is already on there.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
That depends on how the OEM did the \I386 directory.  If the \I386 is not updated with a service pack, then you can use the original Win2K CD.  But if the OEM updated it with a SP, then you want to back it up and use it for future system updates.<br />
<br />
Personally, I use an updated \I386 on my machine so I won't have to install the SP separately.  :)</div></div><hr />

It's not that I don't have disk space, but I like to keep the C: partition small because I use Norton Ghost to back up the partition, and everything unnecessary on C: makes the partition image file bigger. I moved pagefile.sys to another partition. I have MS office 2000 but I didn't install it because, no matter where I tell it to install, it puts several hundred megs on the C: partition! :mad: Right now the size of the partition is just about exactly 2 gigs. The image file (compressed) is about 1.4 gigs. <br />
<br />
About a week ago I was glad I had the partition backed up. The &quot;windows installer&quot; got stuck when it tried to install Mcaffee virus scan. To make a long story short, the  only  way I could stop the installer was to restore the C: drive from an image. After I restored the partition all my problems were solved!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I noticed MS Office dropping a lot of stuff on C drive also... I was installing MS Office XP (2002) and because I messed up and made my C partition too small I figured I would install it on the D Drive. Well it put most of the program over there but I did notice that I lost 80 Megs on C (and that was 80 Megs I NEEDED). I have changed back to my large drive being the boot HDD and it is all good now. :)</div></div><hr />

May MS Office die a painful, costly, quick death.  Anyone remember MS Bob?<br />
