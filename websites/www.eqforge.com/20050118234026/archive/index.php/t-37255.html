We eventually discovered that the reason we couldnt format the hdd and load windows was because the memory was bad.  (discovered this by trying some of my friends memory in the comp).  we loaded windows with this memory.  i've since been back to the shop to get the memory changed.  however, although the computer now works with this memory, there are small bugs happening, such as programs crashing was i click the icon to load them.  also computer games suddenly just close down after so long.  is this a bad installation of windows, or do i need to go and get the memory changed again?</div></div><hr />

Then go from there based on your results. Make sure the RAM is COMPLETELY secure and clipped in :)</div></div><hr />

I have managed to find out that it is the memory.   Its either faulty or just not fully compatible with my motherboard- im not sure.  im going to take the memory back and ask to swap it for the same make of memory as my friends, since that works fine in my machine.</div></div><hr />
