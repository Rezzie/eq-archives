<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy76</div><div class="date">Nov 21, 2002, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to get some ideas of what other developers use out there and why. My office currently uses make, gnumake I believe, but we are going to Ant. Who is taking us to Ant? Why me of course! :crazyeye: <br />
<br />
We do a lot of Java and C++ programming here with a little VB thrown in for fun. I don't do any programming yet but they are hoping that this will help me learn a bit. :)<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggestion something other than Ant and why would you? Oh, and it has to be freeware or at the least very cheap. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I forgot what's it's called.....ant something...or something ant.....just search for ant and you'll find tons of different proggies, download a few of kazaa(usually they have a trial version or else they are free) and look at the features :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You decide that :)<br />
<br />
PLEASE, let's get back on topic :p<br />
<br />
Have you done the search for Ant and make yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy76</div><div class="date">Nov 23, 2002, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't need to; I have Ant and Make books and programs. ndering what other people use for development, hopefully in a business enviroment and not just at home. We currently use make, gnu make I believe, and we are converting to Ant. I feel like I have said that before. :p I wanted to get feedback from others....websites normally point out only the good points of the software. I wanted to know it all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Nov 23, 2002, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh shut up :p<br />
<br />
Like I said, just do a search. Then, you could always TRY out the software...surely you can do that..anyone can do that :p<br />
<br />
Trying something for yourself shows all points :D<br />
<br />
Dork :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy76</div><div class="date">Nov 25, 2002, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like I have that much time. I am doing most of this on my own time as it is. Like I said earlier, good to know I can rely on gonzo. :p</div></div><hr />
