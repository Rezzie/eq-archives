<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 09, 2003, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These cities are much less developed than the western cities and more vulnerable so I'm recommending to IPRB a settler in Naervana - we really need to start connecting these cities with roads ASAP (no nice rivers to speed up unit movement as in the western province). Also the cities are very vulnerable so I'm recommending building an elephant so we can better protect Ipec and VM (the most valuable cities there) - I'm assuming we'll have polytheism a few turns from now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">May 09, 2003, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Voted all the recommended. After we IPRB the settler, we should go for a caravan in Naervana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 09, 2003, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A - Rush the 6 sheilds this turn.  The city will grow going into the next turn, so move the ocean worker onto the forest now. The new worker should go on the Sheilded grass - this would give us 5 shield production (even with the waste) and complete the settler in 2 turns.<br />
<br />
A2 - I'd build the elephant here instead of VM<br />
<br />
No to B - I'd probably build a Dip there next since we don't have one in the area. However, a caravan would not be a bad thing, either<br />
<br />
C2 - (See A2) Although I can understand both sides of the argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 10, 2003, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I once again agree with Tim:) <br />
It's better to spread out the settler support, so I'd like a settler in VM (which right now have good foodprod, but has run out of good food squares and will need irrigation). I'd also like a rider built in Nae for protection against those we can't bribe.<br />
<br />
I voted caravan, but agree we need a dip in the area (FW, Igl, EF and maybe Neu). We also need a good connection though, so we might want to help the settler in Igl at the same time to be able to road between the three cities.</div></div><hr />
