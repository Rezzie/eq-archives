This  was posted by someone, in their &quot;signature&quot; part, I believe.  Stupid me thought I could get it translated by a person where I work and didn't bother to note down where it was found!  And then, it apparently being somewhat idomatic, the literal translation didn't make for a smooth sounding quote.  And when I tried to use Search to find it, using several different words from it pasted in, it wouldn't show up!  (Maybe Search doesn't look in signature areas?)<br />
<br />
Anywho, it someone can enlighten me, I'd be GRATEFUL!!  THANKS!<br />

Some must pay only with their knowledge, since they have (while there is) no better currency.<br />
<br />
That's the best I can do without actually knowing the context. What does this actually mean?<br />

<br />
<br />
Maybe the term &quot;Paid with their head&quot; has rather something to do with beheading than with Knowledge.<br />
<br />
Cause they were not bright enough, their Project failed and they were (metaphorically) beheaded, i.e. held responsible for the failing of the Project.</div></div><hr />
