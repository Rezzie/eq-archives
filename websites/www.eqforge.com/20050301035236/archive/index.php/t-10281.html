Can't you, or is it better to build a city on a resource?:confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
This may be useful for a short time very early in the game, but as I think most people have found out, they are probably a waste of time.<br />
<br />
An attempt to bring a new dimension to gameplay that didn`t really work?</div></div><hr />

I found them useful because I a: didn't want to waste time trying to keep a population happy in a crappy environment and b: didn't want to waste money on the improvements such a city would need to be successful, or c: the resource, for instance diamonds, was in the middle of a mountain range that would take many many turns to be inside my cultural border and since you can't build a city on mountain tiles the colony worked out great! Make sure you station a defensive unit withing the colony though otherwise roaming barbarians will destroy it. Love them colonies!:p <br />

What is the proper procedure to make a Colony? Does the Worker go on the &quot;colony hex&quot;? Where does the little &quot;house and road&quot; icon go? How do I tell that the Worker has actually made the Colony?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance. (And yes, THIS time I bookmarked the thread!)<br />

I responded to your thread..I am not sure if I helped you any. I think what is confusing me is what is a &quot;colony hex?&quot;  It sounds like you have already built a colony to me. <br />
<br />
You may have replied, but since I can't the original thread I tried again.  :) <br />
<br />
By &quot;colony hex&quot;, I mean the location that I want the colony to be placed. Quick example:<br />
<br />
Placed a city, found iron outside of the city's &quot;X&quot;. Built road to the iron hex and then tried every which way I could think of to put a colony in the iron hex. None seemed to work and the Worker just kept flashing as if I had not given it any orders. (I finally got access to that iron by building a new city there.)<br />
<br />
Where does the little colony icon go to tell the worker to work? (I see it but it doesn't seem to do anything.) Where does the worker stand to start the colonization process?<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess I'm just unintuitive because I can't seem to grasp how this process works. I'd have thought that it was like starting a city, plunk the worker where you want the colony, tell him to build, he works for random number of turns, then flashes that he's done.<br />
<br />
Thanks again in advance.<br />

Immediate? No wonder I never saw any work being done... Thanks.<br />
