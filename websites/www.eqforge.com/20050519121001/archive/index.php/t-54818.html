<br />
The current classifications are:<br />
<br />
Settler/worker factory<br />
<br />
This category will build nothing but settlers and units to escort them.  When needed it will also build workers.  These should be low production/high growth cities, and in some cases may need to construct a granary before being set on their 'path'.<br />
<br />
Metropolis<br />
<br />
The primary purpose of these cities will be to generate income, culture and science.  They may also be used to construct wonders, and in times of need, units.  This category will normally contain cities with good growth potential and good production.  They will also generally receive the most attention from our workers.<br />
<br />
Citadel<br />
<br />
The primary purpose of these cities will be to produce trained military units.  A barracks will be one of the first things constructed, and then just enough other buildings to maintain order.  After that, they will almost exclusively produce troops.  Ideal candidates will be cities with mediocre to low growth potential but the ability to produce a good number of shields with only a small population.<br />
<br />
Port<br />
<br />
The purpose of these cities will be to generate trade and science income, allow foreign trade via a harbor, and produce whatever naval vessels we need.  They should build a harbor relatively early on, and then focus on markets and libraries while building enough happiness improvements to maintain order.  These cities will obviously be coastal, with decent production capabilities and growth.  They should be optimized to have as many citizens as possible working the coastal squares, as these produce extra income.<br />
<br />
Border town<br />
<br />
These cities are those resting on a border with another civilization.  They will normally produce several cultural buildings early on, city walls, a barracks, and then can be switched to the Settler/worker factory classification.  They will serve mainly as upgrade points rather than troop production centers due to the fact that they will often experience high corruption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">Jun 01, 2003, 10:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My take on what these classifications should be is as follows:<br />
<br />
Note that these are for Capitoline cities only.<br />
<br />
Noshuret:  Citadel<br />
<br />
Gorina:  Metropolis<br />
<br />
Penguinadua:  Settler factory<br />
<br />
Nar Shadaa:  Settler factory (emphasis on workers, however)<br />
<br />
Xak Tsaroth:  Citadel<br />
<br />
Inadatto:  Settler factory (after it finishes its temple in 3 turns)</div></div><hr />

later on, id feel that these would all be good citadels and metropoleses</div></div><hr />
