I've seen this on other scenarios, such as a WW1 scenario where the French and the Germans couldn't talk. How can I do that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 22, 2001, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You use the events. But you must do it two ways, A is forbidden to contact B and B is forbidden to contact A. Also remember to choose human and computer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Field Marshal Klesh</div><div class="date">Apr 23, 2001, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To have NOBody talk to anyone:<br />
<br />
@IF<br />
NEGOTIATION<br />
talker=Anybody<br />
talkertype=HumanOrComputer<br />
listener=Anybody<br />
listenertype=HumanOrComputer<br />
@THEN<br />
<br />
@ENDIF<br />
<br />
Just chenge the names if you only want to limit certain negotiations.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2001, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">FMK is correct but I would like to advise caution when using the ANYBODY identity. In some events using anybody, the first tribe to trigger the event will be known as anybody to the program and other tribes who are also supposed to be able to trigger the same response will be ignored after that.<br />
<br />
I am not sure which event commands are affected by the ANYBODY problem, so the best thing to do is to check manually after using the ANYBODY identity.</div></div><hr />

In scenarios when you truly want two or more civilizations to keep fighting throughout the entire scenario you tend to have to use that function, otherwise they simply will go to peace further or later...</div></div><hr />
