What's the best scenario ever created and who is the best scnario creator?<br />
<br />
I think that it could be imposible to say, each person have a diferent criterion, somebody like long, other the short ones, somebody want empire building and other war´s scenarios.<br />
Choose the best scenario is imposible and very unfair, I think that the correct question would be what is your favourite or favourites ones.<br />
Or you can made the question in other way:<br />
per example: Which is the best empire building scenario or which is the best sci-fic one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would also like to point out that there are a number of authors that I would say are &quot;dieties&quot; in the world of civ...many listed in the Top 100 scenarios thread and in the &quot;Scenario Hall of Fame&quot; here at Civfanatics. <br />
<br />
Also, scenarios are not competitive across the board or even against authors per se because one very good revolutionary war scenario might have been great in 1998, but the changes, upgrades and graphics available give another designer the ability to make a better one after playing the 1998 scenario and realizing that something could be improved.<br />
<br />
Scenarios as a whole can be said to have a style, such that some designers and some scenarios appeal to are larger number of players over a period of time. I like and design sci-fi scenarios most of the time, but I still play Paul Cauldwell's Civil War scenario. Why? It's simple, challenging, and well done for the version of civ. I've almost won as the Confederates twice and I love to keep trying. It's certainly not the best scenario, especially compared to Kobyashi's, Star Trek: Dominion Wars (read my review), which has changed just about everything you can change in Civ II.<br />
<br />
I'm working on two huge projects myself to be released this summer, but I wouldn't think of them as rivaling anyone else's work, just as something that people will likely enjoy or at least try for something different. And, that's another thing...we all want something different from time to time...<br />
