Mine is 15 GB and it is chock full! Right now I have a little over 100 MBs of it free, the lowest its ever gone, 1 MB!:eek: I thought my computer was gonna die! About 6 GB of my hard drive is taken up by music. I am going to allow multi vote because I know many of you have multiple hard drives. Now to go get the little frog that hopped under my couch, my sister thinks I'm crazy but I did see a frog!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Sep 03, 2002, 10:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I'll just say 2 100+GB HDs since I am buying a new 100GB tomorrow to go with the one I already have. My motherboard can actually support 4 HDs though :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CornMaster</div><div class="date">Sep 04, 2002, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a 1 GB boot drive....<br />
A 6 GB System Drive....<br />
A a 10 GB storage drive...<br />
<br />
yeah...that's less then 20GB.  Wait...let me recheck........*mumbling* carry to 2.....times pie squared...... yep.  Less then 20GB. :)<br />
<br />
However...the 6 GB is on the VERGE of crashing....as in I spent 30 minutes 30 minutes ago coaxing this ship alive.  First it detected it as EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<br />
<br />
Which is obviously incorrect. ;)  Then it wouldn't pick it up at all.  I reseated all the cables....you know...maybe I kicked it in my sleep or something....no dice.<br />
<br />
Then booted to the XP CD to try and run recovery.  And what did I see?  The 1 GB 10 year old drive is there (the one I THOUGHT had crashed...I mean....it's 10 years old!!!) nnoooooooo....it's the 6 GB Western Digital POS was missing!  And it's the system drive.  Anyway...After a few more boots and autodetects....it repicked up the drive. :)<br />
<br />
So I have most of the stuff backed up to the 10GB.....and egerly awaiting the crash.  Unfortuntally.....I only have $200 until the 25th of Sept.  So I don't know how I'll get a new drive..... :(<br />
<br />
But when I do....it will be at least 40 GB. ;)</div></div><hr />

I don't need anything bigger, when I have lots of music I just burn it on a CD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pillager</div><div class="date">Sep 04, 2002, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mine is 20GB, which is plenty for me. I don't dl songs or video, although I do have 10GB of games installed, so I'm down to about 3GB free.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Sep 04, 2002, 04:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ninety gigs.  A 10GB hard drive that was originally installed with my computer and an 80GB hard drive that I added back in May.  Everyone told me I'd never fill it up, but I have.  Now I want a new computer with dual 120s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padma</div><div class="date">Sep 04, 2002, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a 40GB drive.  It has about 6GB left free.  I'm sure that 6G is a lie, but Windows has been screwing with my partitions.  I'm just hoping it keeps working until I can find the time to re-format. re-partition, and re-load. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
But 40 GB are currently unpartitioned and unusable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have an 8 Gigger and a 40 Gigger.<br />
<br />
Gotta upgrade the proc, mobo, ram, and then finally the HDDs.<br />
<br />
Oh, and my system will allow me to have 8 HDDs!</div></div><hr />

So far, just 2 small 80G but they're always running full. So often my downloads stop because there's absolutely not even 1 byte free on it. 0byte free it usually says. And it won't improve those days (because of icewindale 2 and sudden strike 2 :))</div></div><hr />

<br />
It'll do just fine until they come out with 10gb games :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panzar75</div><div class="date">Sep 06, 2002, 03:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a total of 220 gigabytes, which isn't nearly enough. I will at least double that when I can afford it.<br />
<br />
Movies, games, TV-series and so on... CD's yeah, well, too much work. And too easy to lose. No to mention, rather expensive.<br />
<br />
I paid as much for my first harddrive, a whopping gigabyte as I did for my last one which is 120 gb. Now there's a good price development for once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MajorGeneral2</div><div class="date">Sep 06, 2002, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow. I have 4GBs. And I'm using barely 65% of it. Of course, I don't bother with music, videos, etc. Mostly games, and only the ones I play often at that.</div></div><hr />
