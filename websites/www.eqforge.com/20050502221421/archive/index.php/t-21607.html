This sucks the big green weenie!!<br />
<br />
Is &quot;Doable&quot; some sort of scandanavian synonym for &quot;Death by bunga, take away all possible advantages for the expansionist trait.<br />
<br />
First perceptions can be deceptive on this map and I am not sure a diety or emporer level contest is appropriate with all random settings and the lack of robust testing on the V1.21 patch release. I would have randomly generated the map in the editor and then perhaps added some key resource or terrain modifications.<br />
<br />
There are some severe embedded bugs in CIV3 particularly in the RNG routine. As an example, I made what may be the perfect starting move decisions for this map (won't discuss them yet) and have popped 7 huts so far.<br />

I just have 2 words:<br />
<br />
Russia!?!? NNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Given my experience with them in GOTM5, and starting on a mountainous (*GASP* and narrow!) peninsula, it doesn't look good. I only got 1 hut (regional map). I don't know how you could've gotten 7 huts. :) I moved one square north of the start... Plus, I think the Russian scout beat me to it.<br />
<br />
And, what's worse? It's only 1700 BC, and the Egyptians JUST COMPLETED the Colossus!!!!!<br />
<br />
(I have 2 cities, one more on the way. Is this bad? Does anyone have more at 1700 BC?).</div></div><hr />

Techs are ok but really not much value since the ai whips through it so fast. Main edge of scouts is fast contact with other civs. Then if you can establish some favorable trades you can get most of the ancient techs with some careful swapping.</div></div><hr />

Edit: 710 AD<br />

Well, it looks like there was an Anglo-Sino-Roman war, and Germany's shrinking. It seems Russia and Rome (the top 2) are taking their share of the German pie (via the histograph). Can't be too sure though.<br />

Its 270AD and I'm still alive. Main income is selling my map every turn. Scouts are my major income generators! <br />
<br />
Germany running amok. Scouts sit on mountains and watch the carnage. There are some serious battles taking place outside my peninsula.<br />
<br />
Yes sir - anything you want sir you can have sir. Just dont bother with me......<br />
<br />
Survival is main priority. Mountain chains always help in this respect. At least I'm not the first civ to be wiped in this game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">troilus</div><div class="date">May 01, 2002, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like I'm not alone in having a difficult time on this map. Right now its 480 a.d. in my game, and I was just able to trade for education from the germans (for my only gems; I traded my other gems for gunpowder from the japanese, since I don't really need them for more than two cities yet). I was going to start a 12-mounted-warrior-attack against the russians (this was circa 100 ad), to grab some land and maybe even a gl, but their many riflemen dissuaded me. <br />
<br />
Not that education will help me much yet, since I’m have but one city beyond size 6. Why I’m still alive, I don’t know, but the persians and the romans are laying into each other pretty good. Once the last lower green stretch of land is gobbled up and expansion is no longer easy, I imagine the bullseyes will rise to my peninsula. <br />
<br />
I think it is more difficult to have 7 opponents on this map as opposed to 15, because ALL of the 7 are huge and most are nearby with at least one city (which I probably couldn’t threaten, let alone anyone’s core territory) and I’m not much larger than I would be otherwise (well, otherwise on an emperor map—I’m unused to diety). Breathless! And what can we do, my mounties keep asking me, against those cossacks, or all that Roman cavalry? .  .  .  feels like a little piece of real history in the making (hope I get my Little Big Horn).<br />
<br />
Yeah, those mountains are a nice security blanket, but hard to build cities on them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 01, 2002, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it's over. Loss by SpaceShip. Don't know who built it (probably Rome). They were in 2nd all the way (in the histograph), but shot up a good 1,000 points in the end. Plus, Russia (#1) was attacked by Persia and Rome, and lost most of their southern cities.<br />
<br />
Well, here's the wrap up.<br />
<br />
For the first 2000 years, I tried to make my civ grow. I was able to get quite a few settlers ready, but by then, Russia had closed me in. They wouldn't even allow contact with other civs, and my scouts where too deep in the south - would've meant trekking through Russian territory and a possible war that I didn't want. So, gaining techs were slow. I was just getting out of Antiquity when everyone had riflemen, and some infantrymen and cavalry!! I also noticed Germany was in a few spots, and my sole galley found something interesting. An Anglo-Sino-Roman war that had occured sometime in the past. <br />
<br />
1000 BC - 10 AD - I was choking for techs, while most civs wanted my money, but wouldn't give me anything for it. I did trade my furs for horses with Russia. It gave me the Mounted Warrior (of which modern era Persia - close to 1400 AD where AFRAID OF!!!!).<br />
<br />
10 AD - 1000 AD<br />
<br />
I started to recover. built some marketplaces, and finally got to the middle ages. About 20-30% of the map was explored.<br />
<br />
1000 AD - 1485 AD<br />
<br />
Watched as high techs were developed. Started squeezing as much gold as I could, and bought my way up to banking. Built some banks, which certainly helped. Saved up 200 gold, and bought a world map from the Persians. Then I noticed something interesting. Germany had former cities all over the world! (they were destroyed way back - closer to 10 AD, I think). Berlin was gone. Apparently, they tried to do some Antiquity Colonization! hehe... (even on islands!). At the end, Persia kept trying to get me in a MPP. Discression was the better part of valor, as Persia attacked Russia, followed by Rome. A short time later, Enland demanded my furs (I didn't even know it expired!), and the Space Ship was built by someone after that (probably Rome).<br />
<br />
The funny thing is, Persia had the UN by 1275, and there were no votes! Maybe because everyone was polite with me? who knows...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paradõsis</div><div class="date">May 01, 2002, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This map is definately a lot more mountainous than the average map I play Civ3 on (reminds me of the smallest maps on Civ2). I got about 5 cities into the green areas of the starting peninsula, and then also placed one down in the mountains for defense (though I'm sure the other Civs are so far ahead in techs that my spearmen behind walls would be laughed at). Luckily my scout scoped the nice land on the peninsula next to the starting point, so I got mapmaking as quickly as possible and shipped over settlers (4 total). Then my Trireme found the other peninsula beside that one, so I got another 3 cities in good position (as far as terrain). Now I just have to work on fortifying them and building the Forbidden Palace on the 2nd Peninsula. <br />
<br />
Haven't had any battles yet, and I've been able to stay on the AI's good side, for the most part (well, I consider them being only &quot;annoyed&quot; with me to be &quot;on their good side&quot; in this game). I know that the Russians have a massive empire, that Germany has a few cities all over the map, and that Rome is getting punked out by someone, but other than that I haven't tried to keep up on what's happening internationally. I haven't even decided if I should try to take out another civ or two, or to just hope I survive to the end. I think once I get tanks I'll pick a fight with the weakest civ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">May 01, 2002, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My game has been much like Rain's so far... While I only played up to 1400BC, the fact that I have full knowledge of the map, and knowledge of iron/horses locations, makes reading this thread OK in my mind :)<br />
<br />
My initial goal was to cram as many cities into my little penninsula and try and hold on until the end of the game. But when I got out into the rest of the world with my scouts, I realized shockingly that I wasn't that much worse off than the other civs. Most of them have very bad starting positions too... especially Japan and Egypt :lol: Of course the best thing that ever could have happened in my game was getting a settler from the first goody hut. [dance] [party] :bday: [dance] I was literally thanking the Civ3 gods out loud on that one (eliciting a strange look from my roommate).<br />
<br />
Rain is right: the starting spot sucks, and expanding into the no-food mountains is simply not practical. I'm founding my first city across the little bay next turn (with plenty more on the way); it looks like a good area to begin the FP eventually. I beelined for mapmaking right away, and got it pretty fast due to some fancy trading. I think that the two most important things on high difficulty games like this are 1) flawless city management, both to maximize tile useage and build the proper things and 2) mastery over the trading system. I was the first to make contact with the English, setting off this round of deals:<br />
<br />
English: Contact with Russians/Germans for contact with Romans<br />
Romans: Contact with Russians/Germans for contact with Japanese<br />
Japanese: Contact with Russians, Germans, Persians for 2 techs<br />
Romans: Contact with Persians for a tech<br />
Persians: Contact with English for contact with Egypt<br />
Egyptians: Contact with English for a tech<br />
Romans: Contact with Egyptians for a tech<br />
Japanese: Contact with Egyptians for all their gold<br />
<br />
Net result: contact with everyone + 5 techs + cash. I made a similar killing when mapmaking came online; I traded my world map for mapmaking (the tech), sold mapmaking for other techs, sold my world map for money and territory maps, then used that money to buy a world map, and sell it again for more money. This kind of trading allows the human to make up for the ridiculous AI advantages. Of course I will be falling behind soon, and can't prevent that...<br />
<br />
Another thing: when you get surplus gold, either rush something with it in non-despotism or spend it on something. If I have more than 50g, I use it for an embassy because the AI will just demand it from me soon otherwise. And embassies provide info, improve relations, and allow for military alliances. <br />
<br />
This game is pretty sweet! :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Russia now completely taken out by Germany. Made the mistake of signing an MPP with Germany. It was the strongest civ and I figured it would keep the rest of the vultures off me. Wrong. Germany declared war on everyone and expected me to do the same ..... Rome marched my way until I gave them everything I had in money and techs (as if) . All I need now is for everyone else to nuke each other back to the stone age and I might sneak through.<br />

Still selling my map to everyone every turn. My scouts give me a fascinating view of the world -  CNN = Colins News Network.....Think I'm just gonna build twenty more scouts and set them watching.....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawrence</div><div class="date">May 02, 2002, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess what I've got?<br />
<br />
It's 310 AD and I'm in industrial times as all the AIs!!<br />
<br />
Wanna know how I made this?<br />
<br />
The GREAT GREAT GREAT Library.<br />
<br />
Here's the tale:<br />
    I built 7 cities, all on the right side(the russians side) since I didn't discovered Map Making until 10 AD. Since I am Iroquois I am developing Warrior Code - The Wheel - Horseback Riding, hoping I can build an army of Mounted Warriors and harass the Russians. <br />
<br />
I got about 9 MWs when it was 310 BC. To my dismay, the Russians has started to build Sun Tzu's Art of War! I figured that if I don't attack soon, I will stand no chance when they got Musketeers( I didn't know at that time there was no saltpeters on this side of the map), so I launch the attack and since my army was not big enough and the Russians' got some pikemen defending their city the war didn't end quickly. We are in a long war now.<br />
<br />
In the war I managed to bring my MWs to Moscow and destroyed all terrain improvements there, meanwhile a pair of Iroquois galleys shipped 4 MWs on the other side of the peninsula and destroyed Russian iron route. So the only units they can build are spearmen and longbowmen. But it is still hard to capture cities since my preparation was not enough. At about 280 AD my MWs finally stepped into Moscow. The city has The Great Library and Sistine Chapel in it. <br />
<br />
The next turn MAGIC happened. I got tech after tech, the dialog &quot;The Great Library was obsolete&quot; appeared, but was not able to stop the 'tech flush' to me. I was immediately upgraded from a poor, backward civ who were busily trying to figure out how to construct things(Construction) to a one-tech-to-industrial civ(only lacks Magnetism). Imagine it, I got the whole middle age passed in one turn!<br />
<br />
It is now 310 AD and I have to stop my assault. The Russians still have Smolensk as their capital, a couple of cities on this part of the continent and some distant towns. But they have discovered Magnetism, and as a scientific civ they got Nationalism for free. When my MWs approached Smolensk I saw riflemen fortified in the city:mad: , and I have no choice but to sign a peace treaty for Magnetism. So I am in industrial too.<br />
<br />
Even with this kind of luck I don't think I will win the game. My entire empire is only producing 30 economies a turn and my biggest city is of size 6. Japan has already twice the score of mine. But I have already SURVIVED 0 AD, that is a BIG achievement.:goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawrence</div><div class="date">May 02, 2002, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have popped many huts. 5-6 of them are empty. Two are techs, one is money and one is a settler. Unfortunately the settler was discovered near south polar. He founded a city there, but in the big war a Russian longbowman come by, my warrior tried an attack, he failed, and I disbanded the city. That is all my luck in huts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 02, 2002, 07:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, sounds like some got lucky with tech-trading. I couldn't even trade a thing! (I think I took my scouts too far south instead of to the left and right) I only found 1 hut, and that was about it. I couldn't even get the AI to trade communications for anything! I think Russia must've did some agressive scouting. As for mapmaking, No one wanted to trade that to me until everyone was in the modern era! I thought about the MW thing, but by that time, Russia had Pikemen, and were fast approaching the modern era.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TD 4 27</div><div class="date">May 02, 2002, 08:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the first time EVER I decided to diary a game.  Note, this is my first Diety game and I surprised myself by making it to 450AD!<br />
<br />
I knew the AI would have a major advantage so I took a chance.  I built a Warrior, Scout, Granary, then Settler.  I founded my second city as a defensive unit producer.<br />
<br />
In 2950 BC, I found Russia and was horrified by their 4-1 tech lead.  Not to mention they had iron in their lands!  I did send a settler out immediately for the horses.  I had started a Worker in that directions immediately after finding it.<br />
<br />
I continued expanding in my penisula and was ready to control the southern bottleneck, but the Persians beat me to it by 1 turn (690 BC).  I knew I was in trouble then, also because the Oracle, Pyramids, and Collusus were built in 1425 (before I could have built any of them).<br />
<br />
I knew Persia only have Immortals (only) and I had Mounted Warriors.  Could I win that battle?  I hoped so, but they moved onto Musketmen before I could fid out.<br />
<br />
In 150BC Russia started making demands of my little country.  What could I do?  I knew this was the beginning of the end.<br />
<br />
Finally in 110 BC I go Map Making and was pleasently surprised by safe land to my West.  I immediately sent a Settler there (30 AD).  In 50 AD Persia made some stiff demands.   I refused, hoping my &quot;safe&quot; western lands would allow me to &quot;start fresh&quot; if they attacked.  Unfortunately in 70 AD I found the Persians just south of my safe point (and the closest Iron to my capital!).  Then England joined the Iroquois massacre.<br />
<br />
In 90 AD Tonawanda fell to an Immortal assault.  No more horses.  But hey, my people improved my Palace on that turn!<br />
<br />
In 130 AD I won my first skirmish.  Mounted Warrior vs Pikeman.  Golden Age for me!  LOL  Rome and Russia must've been scared I'd catch up to their tech leads cause they joined in the massacre too, followed by Germany in 150 AD.  The Germans quickly took Mauch Chunk in 170 AD.<br />
<br />
In 230 AD, Niagra Falls fell followed by Oil Springs.  All this bad news was countered by finding another &quot;safe&quot; spot farther to the west.  In 260 AD I founded Centralia.  Then lost Cattaraugus and St Regis (my first &quot;safe&quot; city).  In 300 AD, Salamanca fell.<br />
<br />
My safety in Centralie ended in 310 AD when Germany sailed a ship that way and planted a settler to the southeast.  In the same turn, I found the Eqyptians to the southwest..  Allegheny fell in the same turn, leaving me with 5 Spearmen in Grand River and 2 in Centralia.  Better than nothing.<br />
<br />
In 330 AD, I sold my soul to the Egyptians to see the world.  I was pissed!  Had I beaten Persia to the choke point, I'd have been able to colonize all the way south (assuming peace) to the tip of the continent!  This way my way to &quot;see the world&quot; before I died.<br />
<br />
I was shocked when 390 AD rolled around.  No one had attacked.  Maybe my Spearmen scared them.  Nope...in 400 AD my Golden Age ended (aren't GA's supposed to be good?) and Persia poised themselves for the kill.<br />
<br />
For some reason, instead of attacking, Persia moved to take out all my improvements.  No more fur trade for me.  In 420 AD, England took Centralia.  In 430 AD I figured out why Persia was stallling...they wanted the rep for taking me out.  In 440 AD they began a naval bombardment of my single city (why?).  In 450 I sued for peace.  They wanted all my gold (and I knew they'd be back) so I refused.   My 7 spearmen took out 7 Immortals and 1 Rifleman before falling.<br />
<br />
I ended with a score of 488.  Persia (I believe) led with a score of almost 10000.<br />
<br />
It was kinda fun being picked on....I guess.  Hope the read didn't bore anyone.  Just wanted to share my humilating loss (one that will probalby be felt by mand GOTM players!),</div></div><hr />

Well, it's over. Loss by SpaceShip. Don't know who built it (probably Rome). They were in 2nd all the way (in the histograph), but shot up a good 1,000 points in the end. Plus, Russia (#1) was attacked by Persia and Rome, and lost most of their southern cities.<br />
<br />
Exact same thing happened to me including the year Rome launched the space shuttle:eek: <br />
<br />
This was my first game at this level and was I not prepared for it.  I was surprised I lasted as long as I did with everyone extorting me for what little I had.  Miles behind in techs, the most advanced unit i built was a swordsman and the only thing I could use that had any leverage with the other civs was my gems (until the japanese wanted them for nothing as well)<br />
<br />
I went south with my scout first finding 6 huts ( 2 empty, 2 techs, 1 warrior, 1 map ) which turned out to be completely useless as the first civ I met (Russians) had the techs I had.  <br />
<br />
In the end it just turned out to be a matter of survival.  I lost 2 cities in a war with Japan (including 1 when I sued for peace) and 3 culture flipped (2 to Persians and 1 to Rome).  My capital got cut off from the rest of the my lands due to Russian settlers. I only seen the middle of the world map. I havent a clue what the rest of the world looked like (except for the Romans territory map which I got for my gems late on)<br />
<br />
Did I learn anything?<br />
<br />
Dunno:confused:</div></div><hr />

How to avoid demands? Have nothing for them to demand from you: keep gold low, go max science all the way, follow the AIs on tech, and trade wisely. If you have a gems surplus, trade it immediately because they will demand it otherwise. As soon as the 20 turns are up, trade again for more tech. <br />
<br />
I'd like to mention that in my game the Germans are sending a large army against either the Romans or English; I've been shadowing them for 30 turns now with my scouts keeping track. By the time they get there, the archers and warriors will be hopelessly out-teched though :lol: I am really hoping for all-out AI warfare soon to slow them down a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would rate this as official Iroquis water torture.<br />
<br />
No water, no gold bonus from rivers, no iron, no sputter. (bet there's no coal either if I make it that far, but coal without iron is just a landmark.)<br />
<br />
I ended up hitting 12 goody huts total. Its a good time to point out that the random number generator can make these Diety level games severly mismatched particularly when the start position is a severe mismatch for the attributed of the civ. 12 huts yielded 7 maps of friendly no man's land, 4 deserted villages and a 25 cent bucket-o-gold. Lots of work for relatively nothing.<br />
<br />
Couldn't get anyone to trade me anything for about 2000 years. They were much more intent on demanding crippling tribute.<br />
<br />
Met everyone but egypt, still not sure where cleo is but that is unlikely to effect anything.<br />
<br />
In 540 AD, finally got grass in front of my stone hut while 7 russian infantry stood on a mountain nearby and watched my spearman drink salty water to celebrate.<br />
<br />
I am trading at every opportunity to stay a float, get about 4 or 5 extra coins per turn by trading my highly advanced world map for 1 coins from each civ. That's all they will give without being insulted. No GA, no GLs, No wonders, No techs, No joy in mudville.<br />
<br />
Germany just sent a stack of 8 settlers trooping through my tiny territory with 40 or 50 escorts of various classes from swordsmen and pikes all the way up to longbowmen, knights, and riflemen. Not sure where they were going. They acted like the Borg.<br />
<br />
Can't say I'm learning anything other than, the CIV3 game design for Diety level is very much dependent on the RNG. Sometimes you get the bear and sometime the bear gets you. With the designed in factors to give the AI's a 70% cost advantage in every area, its hard to imagine a scenario where more than 1 in 16 or 1 in 32 players would truly enjoy playing in this scenario.<br />
<br />
I want to reiterate that total random generation at diety level for the GOTM is inappropriate. Using those settings with a preset civ, only one out of 64 map games will represent a truly enjoyable gaming experience. The start postion and random luck in the first turns dominates the game instead of any reflection of player ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i  moved the first scout south. build queue scout/warrior/settler.<br />
<br />
i don't build any infrastructure at first at these high levels cos they are useless so i now have 7 cities, it's 1300bc and 15 warriors poised to be upgraded to swordsmen to strike the russians before they get musketmen. i thought i could maybe squeeze some alliances with the germans, persians or romans but what do u know? no iron!<br />
<br />
i could have lived with the crappy start position right next to the russians with their prime steppes...with cows, wheats, rivers and beeaaautiful land.....but i cannot live without iron!  by the time i hook up the horses my MWs will be useless. <br />
<br />
the russians are now building sun tzus, nobody has built the great library and the germans are crawling around planting cities in my tiny little neck of the woods. <br />
<br />
without iron, i am toast! i will tell you all how i lost.<br />
my 2 scouts are doing their part to slow things down by pillaging any improvements outside cultural borders. the stack of 10 immortals jumps around wondering what happened.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
just for the record, this was the least enjoyable GOTM of them all and the map is really disappointing. oh what a difference some iron makes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">troilus</div><div class="date">May 02, 2002, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, to finish. I guess I wasn’t doing so awful, since I had 12 cities, which included the oil, gems, and silks below our peninsula, and the iron to the west (and one city on the peninsula west of that). I think  Iwas too busy spreading down to get the land west in time. I was able to get by peacefully for a while, trading everything constantly to a-get stuff with it and not lose it to extortions, and b-keep my neighbors friendly with me (per-turn trades keep things peaceful!). I was around 4 techs from modern when war broke out, and I was able to trigger a GA (my mountie got a cossack!), but four turns into the war the Russians won a space victory (1445 ad). I was actually able to defend successfully against the russians (who knows how long that would have lasted), I think getting to replaceable parts is of key importance—that is worth any mad rush of tech trading. Stretching down to the silks helped with that, a lot.<br />
<br />
Well, good luck, all else.</div></div><hr />

You think THAT is bad? In my game, Berlin completed the PYRAMIDS in 1870 BC! Russia got the ORACLE in 1675 BC.<br />

The good news is that we were allowed to finish the Colossus in 1575 BC, starting the Iroquois Golden Age. :)<br />

I am at 320 AD.<br />
The Romans are way ahead of anyone(1495). I have an edge on Russia (639-609).<br />
I was able to get the Gems on the Southern region of our continent. The Persians almost got them, but my conscript warrior took out his warrior, and I used my two new workers for bringing in the Gems. I also built a city on the land bridge to protect myself.<br />
I have fought three short wars. The first was against the Persians after I took out their warrior. They sent another settler over and actually established a city, but I managed to destroy it.<br />
I fought the Germans for a short time. I don't remember why, but they asked for peace when I had two units outside their city which is between me and Russia.<br />
I also picked a fight with Russia when Mother Russia built a city to steal my horses! I am not sure why she sued for peace, but she gave me three techs and all her money, and two workers. Wow!...I think.:goodjob:<br />
Now I have iron in one of my cities. I just need to get a harbor built so I can make little swordsmen.<br />
uh. oh.<br />
There are about...8 immortals and a pikeman coming my way. :cringe:<br />

I got 10 or so huts that worked out to my favor, a few techs (Bronze Working on my first hut! Also got Wheel, Warrior Code, and Polythiesm) and 2 settlers. <br />
I pretty much concentrated on settler production and through trading I was able to stay up technology-wise until about 1000 BC, after that I just saved money and tried to trade. The bottom of the southern penninsula was all mine and the area to the north with the silks on up to starting postion I controlled. I had no wars what-so-ever, no GA either. <br />
I only built Temple, Marketplace, Harbor in my citiesfor the most part. I finished in 5th place, which wasnt bad for me, with a score of 1690. Not bad for my first completed Diety game. :crazyeye:<br />
Persia ended up winning after they built the UN in 1130 AD. They aligned themselves with everybody to take on Rome, who was in 2nd place just about the whole game and had what seemed the best area.</div></div><hr />

When I saw the start it reminded me vaguely of the last emperor game we played for GOTM. Since at this level the AI has a big advantage I decided on a plan to 'cherry pick' building sites and explore as much as possible. The plan has paid off so far. It's 360 AD and I just took the lead on points. I have the lead in land area but my lead in power is on paper only cause my military is still from the ancient times and we are just about to go to the industrial era. I have been able to bluff in negotiations but if a real war breaks out I will be in big trouble. If I can win it looks like it will have to be diplomatic or by culture.<br />

It also seems that if you declare war, your units have a lesser chance of winning than if the enemy declares war. (Conscript riflemen sure are deceiving with 1 HP left...) :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still, spotting the English warrior across the ocean was crucial.  I traded contact with all the civs on my continent for some techs and a world map, which I then traded to all of the other civs for even more techs and a bit of gold.  In all I think I got around 7-8 techs out of that deal and the ones that followed because of it.<br />
<br />
My problem with goody - huts:  They are all abandoned!!!  Out of more than 10 huts, I got Warrior Code, 1 &quot;surrounding-area&quot; map and the rest were deserted villages.  But I don't reload and cheat, so at least I can live with the satisfaction that I played fair.<br />
<br />
At around 700 B.C., my empire spans 3 peninsulas with 8 cities.  All the other empires are at least 20 cities, but they are having all sorts of  wars.  I am just trying to remain neutral and cranking settlers to  claim as much land as I can.  I might try to win by diplomacy on this one, since I probably can't do it by military might.  Actually, I've only finished 1 of the previous 6 GOTM, so the chances of me actually winning this one are slim to none.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawrence</div><div class="date">May 04, 2002, 03:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unbelieveable, I won!!:D<br />
<br />
My first try on Deity turned out to be VICTORY!!:goodjob:<br />
<br />
And it is a victory by Space Race, I would never imagine I can keep up with the computers in the modern time even though I had such a luck on Great Library.<br />
<br />
Last time I stopped by 310 AD when I got to industrial, but still a small and poor country, I will start here.<br />
<br />
Looking around I know that I would never be able to wage another war now. Although I had 15+ MWs which can be upgraded to Cavs 'theoretically', I have neither the money nor saltpeter to upgrade even one of them. When I set science percentage to 0%, I could get only 40 gold per turn(how miserable I am!).:eek:<br />
<br />
The world is not peaceful, war is a constant threat to everybody. Most wars are fought between a Western(Rome, Japan, England) and an Eastern(Germany, Persia, Egypt) country, as the AI was stupid enough, they always take the land route and walk all the way through my territory.  ;)  Hence a constant sight in my country was an Egyptian force of 15 units faces a Roman force of 15 units and they just fight beside the Iroquois city Oil Springs! :confused: As I didn't have any ROP agreements with any of them, these armies took a really long time to traverse Iroquois land, I guess this slowed down the AIs' steps greatly, and that might be the reason I was able to win. :D <br />
<br />
Back to Salamanca. Before 800 AD I was busy developing my economy and population, the science percentage was always 0% and the money was used to hurry granarys and harbors. The AI distorted several times for money and territory map, they got satisfied, so no one punished me, that was great since my defensive force consisted of only spearmen, I haven't got any Iron or Saltpeter or Nationalism. <br />
<br />
At about 800 AD I decided that I have to start to catch up. In the 450 years before the AI didn't developed too many technologies, and during the course England and Egypt was lagged behind. So through some clever trading and diligent researching I was able to make the gap smaller. In late industrial the Germans became the target of mighty Persians and Romans and also falled behind, so I managed to get Atomic Theory, Electronics and Motorized Trans from them, researched Radio I became the fifth to come to the modern age.<br />
<br />
The Germans at this time was unable to keep the Persians outside their borders and several German cities were destroyed. Their capital, Berlin, got many good wonders. Namely, Pyramids, Smith, and Bach. Eager to have those, I signed a ROP with the Germans and soon declared war after getting my tanks next to Berlin. Every civ immediately turned 'Gracious' to me in the sight of my 'righteous' invasion to the 'evil' Germany. :cool: While I got the real profit from this war when my forces captured Berlin just that turn.:lol: <br />
<br />
The Germans was soon extinguished along with the poor Russians. Now Persia made a choice that made me win. They started an attack at the Romans! :eek: With Japanese and English soon joined the force, Rome didn't even bother to start a vote when they built the UN. Hence I got time to research those Spaceship-related techs. The three most advanced civ(Rome, Persia, Japan) dragged in a World War, they could not match me in research. At last, when their Modern Armors were firing at each other, the Iroquois Ship launched, to their biggest dismay.<br />

But I've noticed something strange in my game. I have seen posts in this thread which mentioned 1485, 1395 and other dates. My victory date is at least 200 years later than the latest of those dates. I don't know why the AI was so slow in my game. Maybe they took too long time in traversing my land. Here's a screen shot of my land in 430 AD. <br />

<br />
But I needed to catch up in techs so when England was left to 1 city left I took all their techs and hoped they would be killed next turn.  Russia got mad at me though.  Rome still loves me and I have an expensive MPP with them but I am worried Russia will still attack.  They have a ton of MechInf dancing around my border.  I am just trying to learn Physics and keep the Russians preoccupied, my hope is that Rome will join an alliance against Egypt or Japan and Russia will join in with us, but this is a fantasy.<br />

I played a PEACEFUL EXPANSION game, no exploits. The first combat action my forces saw was in 1355AD. By that time, some of the AI's already had all the techs they needed to launch, so I had to &quot;take steps&quot; to interfere with their production. Kind of hard to do when you've got five tanks and a dozen artillery and they have 180 mechs and dozens of modern armor, so I had to pull out the old smoke n mirrors.<br />

<br />
My first diety game in a while...and I have to say I could have played it much better with hind-sight (I expect we have alot of those types!).<br />
<br />
<br />
I concentrated on exploration as the expansionistic ability makes all goody huts good for you. NOT one settler from a goody hut, which really disappointed me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I quickly built cities along the peninsula and at the junction between the peninsula and the jungle land. Problem for me was technology and the speed at which the A.I discovered tech.<br />
<br />
Quite simply it is 450 A.D I have a reasonably large civilisation but the lack of water nearly EVERWHERE I AM to irrigate is hindering me big-time. The A.I rarely traded tech with me and we have some very powerful civs out there dominating the world.<br />
<br />
I wish I had just gone military and mounted warrior rushed the Russians instead of the Germans taking them over.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will survive, the question really is will the A.I by fighting itself give me the chance to win? I think the lack of rivers and the numerous hills really have made this an arduous game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I figured I would be history by 10AD as I popped 8 goody huts and got..........can you guess???...........squat...didly...nothing!<br />
<br />
So I stayed on my peninsula and beelined for map making.  I left one tiny square uncovered in the extreme NW of my territory and Catherina plopped down Riga.  It took away the second fur from me eventually.<br />
<br />
So I played to hold out as long as I could.  Yes, I sold my only iron and fur to other civ's attempt to catch up.  I watched in dismay for centuries as that little city Riga led to many Russian units rolling through my territory without regard for my soveriegnty...nor did I say a word.  I saw a stack of infantry and calvary roll by my capital, defended by five spearmen.  I was poor and weak.  I bought all my tech from Catherine so she wouldn't attack me.  Eventually I got tanks, and plopped a settler down next to some oil in the former Roman empire.<br />
<br />
Then I saw my chance, the Brits built the UN beating the Russians to it, but the Ruskies were conquering the world (took out the germans and greeks, had the Egyptians on the ropes.)<br />
<br />
I knew it was only a matter of time before war broke out with England, so I loaded my two Galleons (yes, I could not afford to upgrade them) with tanks and set them off the coast of england waiting for the war.  Unfortunately for me, the Japs struck first and raised London.<br />
<br />
So I built into the spaces left by former Civs.  Eventually had about 16 cities with factories and was starting to build a spaceship when the Russians wiped out the Japanese and the remainder of England.  Won by domination, and an impressive victory it was, 30,000 gold in the bank, and hundreds of modern armor running around.<br />
<br />
Amazing game in that I didn't go to war once, nor was I attacked, but in the end, I could have had a shot at winning if the Japanese could have held out.<br />

I was riding high at the time, with a territory almost as large as the other civs and only one or two techs behind the leaders. <br />
<br />
Well a lot has changed since then... :crazyeye:<br />
<br />
Fortunately, not all of it was bad. I fell behind drastically in the Middle Ages, both in terms of expansion and tech as the AI bonuses began to offset the advantage I had from popping so many goody huts. Well, that and the starting postition is terrible land for rapid growth, and cities quickly become corrupted since east and west of the capital can't be used to build cities. Let me put it this way: I was on Education when the Russians entered the Industrial Age! :eek: THAT was an unpleasant wakeup call (I knew they were ahead, but not by so much...)<br />
<br />
The sad thing is the AI didn't even skip optional techs, they were just researching purely at that speed. Well, the most important thing I learned is that everything on Deity is about trade. You cannot possibly survive without squeezing every possible tiny drop from the trading system, especially in this month's starting position. And the biggest bang for your buck in trade comes from trading luxuries and resources. <br />
<br />
Around 500BC I began settling in very spread out locations in order to secure as many resources as possible. Unfortunately I lost almost every settler race I was engaged in. :cry: The Russians beat me to the horses near the starting position by 2 turns, then proceeded to build a library and university in the city so I couldn't steal the tile by culture. England beat me to the cluster of two silks in the south by 3 turns, though I did get the lone silk next to it. (That city had better flip to me soon too... it has no culture and I control almost 10 of its 21 tile possible radius) My scouts saved the gems for me though, by standing on the only desert tile in the mountains where a city could be built, thereby saving it from the Russians :goodjob: Those two gems have, of course, more than paid for themselves. The Romans had built a city on iron in the south, but it was razed by the English in a war and I settled there almost immediately. That iron brought in big time deals from the Japanese, who have none on their island (and I'm still supplying them now :))<br />
<br />
So the goal was to trade luxuries and strategic resources for tech. I kept one lux for myself and sold the others to the highest &quot;bidder&quot;. I deprived myself of both irons again and again for tech - it's not like I could stop an attack anyway! Slowly, the 12 tech deficit began to lessen. The AI civs got into some bigtime wars; England and Rome fought practically forever, with the result that the Romans have now been reduced to a single island city (darn; they're gracious with me too... there goes a UN vote) The Germans and Russians similarly went at it, and unfortunately for me the Russians won. They are also hunting down a few scattered German cities at the moment. But this did slow tech down a little (although not much)<br />
<br />
Finally, I got into the industrial age in 330AD (AI entered it in 10AD), only to see that the other civs were still about 5 techs ahead. It was a bit frustrating to see the Russian infantry walking by as soon as I entered the industrial period. I continued to make harsh deals as much as possible, but increasingly found that my luxuries were losing their buying power as the techs increased in &quot;cost&quot;. Fortunately, strategic resources are always in demand. :) <br />
<br />
The AI hasn't made it easy either, as Russia and Persia took different research paths and rushed through several techs very fast. But again, as expected, the industrial age introduction of railroads (which I paid all my income to get), factories (an iron deal), and electricity --&gt; irrigation everywhere (another pain in the ass deal) have started to turn the game in my favor. I have a good group of about 12 core cities that stand to become massively productive in the near future. They are currently low on population and shields, but now that I can actually irrigate, the granaries I have in place will explode growth all over the area. I also have a well placed Forbidden Palace, and very little overall corruption. To make matters better, Persia's only source of coal popped into my territory to accompany the one I already had. I was more than willing to give it back - in exchange for replaceable parts. :lol:<br />
<br />
Finally, after another massive series of trades I got the message I wanted: Sid told me &quot;We are technologically advanced.&quot; I definitely felt a sense of accomplishment from that! As it stands now in 530AD, I am one tech back, lacking only Scientific Method. Unfortunately, someone else is going to build TOE, so I will be behind again soon. But my income and production is going to be going up drastically over the next 50 turns (it already has in the 10 since I got the crucial techs) while the AI civs will go practically unchanged. Barring an AI attack, I should stay caught up on tech permanently now and be in position to nail the UN. As long as they keep fighting each other, I *should* win. With that said, no game on Deity is ever in the bag until the victory message pops up, and this is a Looooong way from that point. But I feel I have weathered the storm and things are only going to be going up from here. :king:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">May 05, 2002, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally done. Made it alive to 1650 AD and was only 3rd fron the bottom when England jumped to the lead and completed 2 parts of the Shuttle in one turn.<br />
<br />
It is important to emphasize here, that games on the Diety level are really dominated by the impact of the start position and the random number generator. Because the AI cost factor is 6 to ur human cost factor of 10, every small variation in the random number outcomes gets multiplied turn after turn. This means that no two people will be playing anything that looks like the same game after about 100 turns of play.<br />
<br />
In my game we got bupkis from the goody huts due to the RNG.<br />
<br />
In my game, all the AI's survived by the grace of their peers. Rome, Japan, and England got into the first war with Rome setback about 50% and England gaining all the former Roman holdings.<br />
<br />
Russia and Germany dominated all the early growth and wonders by a 4 to 1 lead such that it seemed at one point as if Russia was up to almost 6000 points in the early AD and had a culture lead that was unholy.<br />
<br />
I think Hiawatha was researching Astronomy when the first AI civ offered a MPP. We cowered and set back because Russia was all about us and Germany's expansion had surrounded us on the west side. The Settler Diarhea was over whelming. At one point there were 20 AI settlers moving through the Jungle isthmus to the south.<br />
<br />
Russia had beaten us to the isthmus and the oil but had position their isthmus city to take the Uranium mountain (that was invisible to me as the Human but obviously the Russians could see).  Instead of blocking the isthmus with the city and also positioning the city to open a &quot;Panama Canal&quot; between the east and west, Russia chose the mountain position. This left the isthmus open to traffic. All the AI civs would tromp about 40 units toward the isthmus and whenever someone would pass a unit through the one tile neck, then all the other units would reverse and head back the other way because they thought their route was blocked. Stupid.<br />
<br />
Finally saw the world map and Cleo. The Egyptians definately had the worst starting position of all, but the ability to build $6 people instead of the standard $20 kept them in the game.<br />
<br />
In about 890, Russia threatened us with annihilation if we did not give her 11 gold per turn and join an MPP/ROP. Thought this might be the beginning of the end. Already trading her Gems to keep peace and gain techs so how could me refuse. About 12 turns later, all hell breaks loose and Germany attacks Russia. I think the point count was Russia 6100 and Germany 3200 with the Iroqs in 8th place at about 500 points. Kept stacks of about 10 spearmen fortifying the home isthmus and loaded all 8 of our mounties into our single Galleon (two trips in one turn) across the narrow water gap to the southwest.<br />
<br />
The mounties assaulted one German infantry defender backed up by a rifleman and 6 of them died in the valiant effort to crack a GA before golden number 7 scored the victory. Our one gold per turn effort to build the FP also came on line and &quot;Wallah&quot; 200+ gold miracle economy.<br />
<br />
Now began building stuff and buying techs to regain parity.<br />
<br />
Russia decides the MPP with us is of no value and cuts us off but keeps ROP and trade.<br />
<br />
By the end of the GA, Russia had reduced Germany to Berlin plus about 4 cities and then Persia, Egypt, Rome, England, and Japan all join in against Russia. The ensuing war reduces the russian world domination (losing Moscow and many other Russian home cities.) Russia's point total remains number 1 throughout the game even though they are now clearly in 4th or 5th place.<br />
<br />
The war lasts up until the 1300Ad time period and I am able to gain techs and them colonize an oil source way down south in the promised land. Only got two turns of oil out of that location because Russia, Egypt, and Persia were all at ware all around and the links back to Salamanca were via ROP and the foreign harbors. SInce the AIs were decimating each others roads and cannibalizing their own communist populations, the harbors and road links evaporated.<br />
<br />
Used those two turns to upgrade infantry to mechs.<br />
<br />
Even though Russia was virtually destroyed, the massive culture memory had her cities flipping back to her throughout the game.<br />
<br />
Eventually got our local oil source to culture flip to us from Egypt who had taken it from Russia, but that evaporated in just about 10 turns as well. Had set every city to build mech inf in the interim.<br />
<br />
Bought improvements at every turn possible to minimize the impact of almost constant extrotion demands from Persia and Japan. Sold worthles World maps for 1 coin or 2 coins per turn to suppliment income for almost 200 turns (tedious, tiring and not lots of fun).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another 20 turns played has resulted in a much worse situation. To put it simply, the AI is researching WAY too fast. Russia took out Germany by 400AD in this game, and Moscow has a perfect central location for a combined Russo-German empire. With their 24-shield libraries, they are just pulling ahead at massive speed. Since both Rome and Germany are finished, and Egypt is way behind, I have to buy techs at 5th civ prices, which are very, very high. The AI is staying out of war, which I desperately need them to start to have a chance. At the current pace, the modern age will be entered in 900AD - that's pretty fast even for a Deity game. Even after paying for a ton of techs, I am still behind by one (Radio). <br />
<br />
I see only one real chance: trigger a golden age at the critical time right before the AI enters the modern age and use the boosted income and shields to catch up and steal the UN. I can do this by sending mounted warriors to attack Germany's 2 remaining cities; I plan to try this very soon. It's a longshot, but the only chance. Otherwise, I will have to start a war between Russia and England, but that will be extremely dangerous to me. <br />
<br />
As others have said, Deity games come down to a lot of luck. I've had my share before, but the lack of real AI warfare over the last 500 years has really hurt my chances at winning. Similarly, if the civs had all stayed relatively equal, I could have bought techs at the cheap 8th civ costs. But the victory of Russia over Germany has been a disaster for my chances of winning.</div></div><hr />

Sullla: I popped 16 huts, got a maps, a conscript warrior, one tech, and 13 abandoned villages, in that order. My second city was founded in 2390BC. You got within a few techs of the lead? I was behind by a whole era or more through the whole game and came within a few turns of an AI completing a launch. When it's over for you, try replaying without that free settler at the start and see how it goes for you.:)<br />

Sirian: I'm 100% convinced I would have had no shot without my incredible fortune of an earlier settler. :) Starting with two settlers, like the AI does on Deity, probably makes my game uncomparable with other who didn't have that fortune (my second city was built in 3750BC, thanks to the hut). <br />
<br />
One thing I'd like to know is how you were able to catch up on tech; I've fallen behind at various points but was only (&quot;only&quot; :D) about 12 back at the worst point, and rarely more than 4 or 5 back. I understand the idea (probably necessity) of starting a war between the AI civs on Deity so they go communist, but I still find it hard to believe that they didn't build a spaceship if so far ahead. Were you sabotaging their production on spaceship parts, or are they really so dumb as to build nothing but military? I am planning on triggering a war between the #1 AI civ versus the #2, 3, and 4 ones in the near future, but I need to get some infantry and not warriors/spearmen in my border cities first! :lol: <br />
<br />
<br />
Research bogs even for the AI's in the industrial age, and especially in the modern age. Egypt was #3 on totem pole in terms of tech and had only four techs (Computer, Rocket, Fission, Space Flight) when I finally got to the modern age. The AI's stopped having enough cash to buy techs automatically late in the industrial age, and so I think the &quot;simultaneous research&quot; down different paths came to a halt, and the true tech leader was pulling all the weight with pure research and no more help. I also pulled some diplomatic tricks to better my own position, but I don't want to give them away even in the spoiler thread, since I don't actually believe everybody still playing always avoids the spoilers. (HINT HINT, NUDGE NUDGE. What are YOU doing here in the spoiler thread while still playing? :p ). :lol:<br />
<br />
I don't think the AI's got ALL the techs needed to launch until right about the time I got my spies into operation, as only Russia had modern armor for many years, and they were pursuing (and not entirely out of the range of achieving) a domination victory, with no resources spent on the space race. The civs that stayed in democracy until the very end (Persia, Egypt) were the ones who started building their ships asap.<br />
<br />
As for how I kept up, well... other than min science gambit, which netted me five techs total, I did not do a single lick of research until SuperConductor. This includes the very start of the game, for the first time ever I tred a NO RESEARCH policy and had just enough cash on hand as a result to trade for a commodity I could then trade for research, and caught up on all the very earliest techs in one big leap.<br />
<br />
Germany was wiped out relatively early, so my last-civ prices were 7th of 7, and this held true until I caught up to modern age. I got a couple modern age techs at 5th of 5, then one at 3rd of five for which I traded for two more at 5th of 5, then I had to research the last three techs myself. I also traded once more with low man on totem pole for Recycling, at 5th of 5, but that was last minute and of no consequence.<br />
<br />
I was more than a whole era behind from the moment the AI's hit the midieval age (while I still had NO TECHS AT ALL other than the two I started with, plus Mysticism from a hut) until I caught up to the industrial age while they were all building Hoovers in about 700AD. Other players got to industrial before me, it seems, but they either had free settlers or went the militaristic route. I was building my cities peacefully, so I didn't NEED more tech yet anyway, I was still building the basic stuff then in all but my innermost core cities, who were busy building me a scrappy military anyway. That's when I started to close the gap, and the whole way I skipped all the optional techs except Monarchy (at min science) and Democracy (paid for with my firstborn), so I could swap to those governments at my earliest chances. I had WAY too many units (warriors, workers) to make early republic a good choice, as I spread out as far and wide as I could and wanted to keep my unit count very high to deter surprise attacks.<br />
<br />
The AI's were RACING on tech through the middle age, the leaders all in republic and using cash to rush their infra (some were expanding borders a few turns after founding cities), and the rest in Monarchy tagging along. The German war was the only early war of note, and it was a massacre. They vanished in less than ten turns. The wars from then on were either wiping out colonies (consolidating control of disputed areas down to one or two civs) or else phony, for the most part, until the modern age was already WELL upon us, and Russia marched THIS SoD across my land in 1100AD.<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/sirian-iro-1110ad.jpg <br />
<br />
When that stack got to Rome, Rome started dying in a big hurry. Russia even had a base in the area to retreat to, to heal its wounded tanks and cossacks and mechs, so its losses were high but not as bad as a typical invader. You can extrapolate backward on how long it would take Russia to amass that many mechs for how soon the AI's entered the modern age. I think it was around 850AD (shortly after I got to Industrial age).<br />
<br />
Russia went communist early but that may even have helped them, since they were widely spread out but not having so many cities yet that their total corruption was kaput, and they had already built all their infra long ago at home, so they could afford a production hit there. The communist let them build up culture and strength in their distant cities too and that was just killer for them overall. Being in lots of brush wars, they did most of the colony destruction. Rome was Monarchy all game long, but the rest were democracy for huge stretches, and tech FLEW until they hit tanks.<br />
<br />
How did I catch up? I never did. The AI's beat me to the space race, it was only on a prayer that I managed to maneuver some of the AI's into badgering other AI's enough to disrupt production of the last couple ship parts while I raced through a very late Golden Age, desperately clinging to extremely thin hopes. Having your fate in the hands of AI generals is NOT a fun place to be. :)<br />
<br />
Now if only my luck with the huts had not been historically BAD, I might have had an easier go with this. I was in desperate, dire straits the whole way, even compared to other Deity games I've played.<br />

I had a lot of breaks in my game with the huts, and I would feel almost bad if I didn't use that to produce a good result. I've been rethinking my strategy a bit, hoping to use a war to slow down the other civs. Maybe it will work, maybe it won't - we'll see.</div></div><hr />

anyways...some bad starting position give me some bad start...my scouts went out to find some better location...but by the time my scouts crossed the mountains to the east, Russia was everywhere already...but the funny thing is...10 turns later, Germany has taken almost all of Russia. Persia and Egypt took the rest to the east. I got just one city there b4 all the lands were filled there. Also sent some settlers down south. Took that choke point to prevent the east civs from going west and west civs from going east. But Persia and Egypt got across the sea anyways.<br />
<br />
Well...by 0 AD, i STILL dun have iron, and everyone was getting into the industrial age...i m still getting Monarchy at 40 turns...that was sad...but i acquired some gems, spice, and silk, got a whole bunch of tech. Still, no iron...<br />
<br />
By 200AD, English went berserk and took the entire west side of the continent, killing Rome like it was nothing. I had to pay all those civ some big money just to stay out of war...since all i have was MWs and Spearmen<br />
<br />
In 400AD, found out to the south below the jungles were all empty rich land...if i had only found out earlier...start making settlers like mad, sent them down in ...galleys...I as too late, Persia and Egypt took most of them in the turns i used to get settlers, i barely got 4 cities there...but they were everywhere now.<br />
<br />
Right now, its around 840 AD, surprised that i m still alive, maybe cuz i m ton a war yet...got iron...finally...and knights could finally be made. I traded for military tradition, but no i cant get any slatpeder, so it was only knights..<br />

<br />
When Sirian mentioned this I realized that the Persians were shooting for a domination victory in my game. That would help to explain why they started a war on the Romans so soon after destructing the Germans.<br />
<br />
In my game the AI got to modern age at about 1400 AD. Surprise as you might be, it is that late. I'm now pretty sure that my territory just helped to this fact. In my game, the English and Egyptians are lagged, but still far from destroyed. Actually, no civ was destroyed in my game until the Germans became the first victim of the Persian empire. In Sirian and Sulla's games, at least one civ is destroyed. I would guess that this would give the destroyer a great advantage in tech so they could modernize that early.<br />
<br />
Since the modern age came as late as 1400 AD. I was able to keep up with the research. I researched a total of 6 techs in modern ages by myself. Don't believe that you can still buy advances at that time, since I offered Persia my exclusive Superconductor and 3900 gold for their Synthetic Fibers and they would still reject me until I have discovered Satellites which I gave them too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: Re-read Lawrence's earlier post. A high-risk strategy played out big-time when he captured the Great Library and got all of the Middle Age techs at once. Not giving out a ROP to other civs, forcing them to take forever to get their armies to one another, was definitely a great move (though I'm sure unintentional). The result was constant warfare by all civs, with no one strong enough to defeat the others, dragging them all down to the player's level. Whether Lawrence engineered it or not, this is the ideal situation for a player on Deity, so I commend his strategy :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

I'm at 1200 AD and the current state of the art tech is Refining and I'm the only one who has Electronics. [Thanks to 'Darwin' the only wonder I have been able to build so far.] <br />

The Egyptians took out the Persians. The Romans took out the English.[After the English attacked me and my MPP was activated.] The Germans took out the Russian. Now Romans have just started a major war with me but they are at war with everyone left on the planet. The Romans and i have traded a few cities the first few rounds of the war but it looks like I'm getting the upper hand now. If that happens I might get a chance at domination.<br />

This is the second GOTM that the English stabbed me in the back while in Polite relations. But this time the Romans, while we had a MPP and a ROP ran about 15 squares up my railroad and razed one of my behind the lines cities to declare war. They then razed about 5 more of my puny ICS cities. When I counter attacked their cities in the jungle areas they only had a riflemen and a musketman in those cities. Taking these cities from the Romans now makes a connected railroad network from every city that I own. This will increase my military mobility to a much stronger position. I still only have a single scientist in the entire empire under democracy and have purchased or traded all my techs to this point of the game. I won't change this until I can research techs cheaper in the number of turns required than the turns required to get enough cash to make a tech purchase. Although I have Electronics I have not found a single site in my domain that I can build the Hoover Dam. &lt;sniff&gt; :eek: <br />

<br />
I knew immediately the random seed preservation was disabled. However, just to prove it beyond any doubt, just now before posting, I loaded up the 4000BC official save at the start, and three times performed the same exact sequences of every move, to beeline to the closest goody hut, and yes, I got three different results. :( Here is a composite screenshot to prove it.<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/sirian-randomseed.jpg <br />
<br />
Apparently, those of us like me who drew really bad luck in the goody huts had more than luck stacked against us. We actually had a worse hand dealt to us! I'm disappointed in this, although in an odd way, even more proud of my win as a result of it. Nobody can discount any of my results as &quot;you had better luck with the huts&quot;. :)<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/sirian-2390bc-mapfile.jpg <br />
<br />
Without the random seed preserved, every RNG outcome in the game changes, not just player to player, but the course of destiny within the same player's game changes at every session break, every new loadup. Was this a mistake? Or by design?<br />
<br />
I found it most odd when Sullla told me his second city was founded in 3750BC. I'd bet he and I made almost the exact same moves to start with our scouts. The dice rolled differently.<br />
<br />
I mentioned spotting this in my report to Matrix, but perhaps he has not opened or read any of those, or even in this thread paying attention, if he is still playing the game. I actually had three game crashes, but only the one at tail end of the game involved combat, allowing me to see that rolls were not coming up the same, as they should have been.<br />
<br />
Anything that adds more luck factors to the comparison between games is not a good thing, in my view.<br />

I got a terrible yield for the 12 huts I popped and after I finished the game to submit, I reloaded the start game and played a couple of sequences to see if the out come would be improved.

Also the random outcome generator had Germany destroyed prior to 1200 BC in one of the scenarios. In one other scenario Russia was hammered down to less than 230 points and 2 starving cities and ROme had beaten england to smoking pulp. All three outcomes were radiaclly different and my iroqs played absolutely no roll in the outcomes short of effecting the generation of the random seed.<br />
<br />
I should reemphasize my position that randomness in tournament games and GOTMs is not appropriate on the buggy scale that it is implemented in CIV3. If this game had had barbarians in it the random effects would been even more widely varied.<br />
<br />
GOTM maps should be randomly generated in the editor and then strategically editted to add or remove resource positioning. I am currently seeing about 1 in 4 to 1 in 3 of the random maps that have screwed upr resource allocations and screwed up starting positions due to flaws in the CIV3 map generation algorithms. The code is amazing in what it does, but there are still some severe unbalancing outcomes that can make a game either trivial or torturous.<br />
<br />
The Map generated by Matrix in GOTMV was a great example, only one river on the whole map and that was through the Russian start position.<br />
<br />
We have already seen several examples of maps without OIL anywhere on the map as well as maps without reasonable ratios of horses and or coal/iron.<br />
<br />
This does not mean that random games may not be challenging or exciting. They just do not qualify as &quot;tournament&quot; games because after only a few turns, the players are no longer playing anything that remotely looks like the same game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I read that, my first impression was :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Upon further reflection, though, I realized that might not even be a major factor, much less the decisive factor, in why the tech race is lagging SO much in his game compared to mine. It could be, but it may not be. And I would like to figure that out at some point. The pace of AI research dictates how much time you have in which to work. Cartouche Bee may indeed have a shot at domination with tech parity in the industrial age. I've gotten to virtual tech parity at that point in a Deity game, and secured every wonder I cared to from ToE onward, but that was prior to the current patch when it was markedly easier to buy your way up the tree.<br />
<br />
ICS, that S stands for &quot;sleaze&quot;. I didn't say that. But that term is now widely in use to refer to it, so apparently I'm not alone in thinking it falls outside the parameters of the spirit of the game. I am sincerely hoping that it's not such an effective move that it will inevitably dominate Civ competitions the way that a couple of overpowered weapons dominate any Descent competition, unless they are left out. If it really is that strong, to a point where going without it would (in terms of competition results) mean a major handicap, it will be impossible to regulate, and all the contests will take on the same flavor, everyone doing the same things. If packing more cities boosts score and boosts chances of taking control of the game, in any and all situations, then any rules &quot;against&quot; doing so could still be exploited. Say that a rule was made forbidding any cities within two tiles of another city. ICS-minded players would then just squeeze all they could in without violating that rule. At some point, piling on more and more rules only ruins the game, as there are times when NOT doing any city packing at all for score or general advantage purposes, where you would do so in a disputed area to claim more of the land, or in some oddball rocky area because the settlement sites are limited by mountains, etc etc. It would be simply impossible to control.<br />
<br />
Since I have no interest in milking goats or anything else, nor any other form of contorting my game to angle toward advantages offered by flaws in the game design, and since I understand that one player's sleaze is another player's good time, I've been hoping that Firaxis could close all the major loopholes and what remains would not dominate competition. If ICS dominates THIS gotm, though, I'll have to surrender that hope.<br />
<br />
In any event, something has led to dramatically slower tech tree progress for the AI's in Lawrence's and Cartouche's games than in my game. AI's are a whole era behind in their games, vs where they are at the same time period in mine. Since I was never in a position in the middle game to foster wars, all I could do was keep my head low and hope I didn't get stepped on while the giants played their games around me. Did Cartouche Bee also pursue an aggressive early war strat? Could that be the key to slowing up AI tech race? If so... :rolleyes: ...yet one more advantage to early war. Most of the teeth of that has been taken out with the closing of poprush loopholes and diminishing of value per population sacrificed (although still necessary for GOTM to forbid adding workers to cities to whip them). Early war should be a viablo option, but if it's the main ingredient in slowing AI tech, I'd find that almost as disappointing as ICS being the cause.<br />
<br />
Or could it be something else? Might it even be pure luck? :( If so, that's an even bigger problem for unpreserved seeds.<br />
<br />
Whatever is the cause of such dramatic shifts in which AI's survive, grow strong, etc, and the pace of research, it would definitely be useful to figure out. Whether by luck or by result of my moves, or both, the AI's in my game were tech gurus.<br />

I did what I'm sure every other competent civ player did: moved the scout on the initial turn to get a survey of the land for the initial settler, then proceeded to pop the goody hut immediately afterwards. The fact that the &quot;preserve random seed&quot; is off explains this.<br />
<br />
But why is it off? I play the game fairly, and believe that the vast majority of others do as well. However, there are some who will reload when things go badly, and this gives them an open invitation to do so. You can reload until you get a settler from the first hut, or reroll every battle turn to ensure that an ultra-risky early war pays off. This is NOT what we want to see in a tournament game. I always felt that one of the best things about Civ3 was that it ended the Civ1/2 possibility of reloading to change battle results. Please, please, do not allow this in future GOTMs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In regards to the tech race and such:<br />
<br />
I suspect that most people that experience fast tech races do so cause they sell techs to the AI. I'm from the old Civ school and don't sell techs(all most never,well, if I want a quick space launch). This selling of techs is probably the factor that accelerates tech advances cause people assume that if they don't sell a tech then they miss an opportunity to recover some expenses. I may miss some profits with my style but I have learned how to leverage this position.<br />
<br />
I didn't do any early or late gambits[ I don't consider gambits to be viable for GOTM at all]. The English took one pop at me earlier for only one turn, then they were much busier with the Romans. So I have not taken the first shot in any war but I will if I want.<br />
<br />
ICS debates have been beat to death but on a standard map each map square [not accounting for curvature] represents a 250 X 250 mile area. So two cites would be 500 miles from city center to city center. If you use them or not is up to the individual. If you want to press your culture it's an option. If you want your city of 1,250,000 square miles (20 squares) out on the perimeter to yield a single shield and commerce you have that choice also, and I have done that too. I am learning to use ICS on outer perimeter areas, this is new to Civ3 for me and used to combat corruption and deliver culture to unholy infidels. ;) <br />
<br />
But to go from researching Nationalism to launching a space ship in 48 game turns does seem a bit out of scale to me. I think it's a result of alot more free trade than ever existed in real life. We can sell a tech to another civ and they can use it right away. It took Marco Polo alot longer than, instantaneously, to bring back treasures from China to Europe.<br />

The Egyptians are about to buy the farm vs my 27 MW and 10 knights after their prolonged war vs the Persians that I forced.<br />
<br />
I paid staggering amounts of gold for alliances and MPP's and broke them just as I was about to go bankrupt. The Germans have no access to resources so had spearmen as their only defense. I made them war the Persians until all their military was gone and snuck attacked their empire. I had all 20 cities in about 4 turns. For a while after that no one would speak to me. Eventually I forced the persians and egyptians to fight and paid the English some 2400 gold to fight the Japanese who declared on me out of the blue. Eventually the Japanese surrendered to me even though we never fought after they destroyed my far west city and the English declared on me. The Romans cannot be bribed to fight the English but the English lost all their military fighting the Japanese so I don't think I have anything to worry about. If they do muster some sort of force I'll just have to bribe them for peace.<br />
<br />
Those immortals were a pain. I'm so glad the Persians are gone.<br />
<br />
Rome, England and Japan are all quite advanced with Nationalism and Industrialization. I have to race to upgrade to cav and rush more units. If I don't win a domination victory before they get infantry I'll be in big trouble. If I can't see the rubber I can't block their access to it.<br />
<br />
I found that switching between monarch and despotism works well. Monarchy allows faster pop growth with irrigated grasslands and despotism allows rush. Having the Pyramids and Sun Tzu's will allow me to use my 50 small cities to rush cav every 20 turns or an average of 2.5 cav per turn. JS Bach's keeps the unhappiness down nicely (Persians built it with a leader they got from attacking me and built it in a frontier city, what luck!) I'm picking up lux along the way though I had to trade away my only fur to avoid bankruptcy when bribing the English. I've only gotten 2 leaders. Once to build an army and one to build the forbidden palace. Its disappointing to have so many elite MW and almost nothing they can defeat anymore. I figure I should have gotten more leaders but other than moving my palace or building more armies I don't have a lot of use for them.<br />
<br />
I also got the massive tech rush when capturing the great library. I went from early dark ages (horseback riding) to mid middle ages in the first turn of the German sneak attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way the three scientific Civs evolve in this game would clearly be part of the difference. There's nothing like a few strong, peaceful, Deity level scientific Civs for raw research capacity. In your game Sirian, it looks like Russia and Persia flattened Germany and pretty much divided the spoils, resulting in two scientific super-powers. If those two usually chose different research paths, that's a lot of research capacity between them. In Lawrence's game he weakened Russia and eventually Persia went after Germany. Sounds like at most one scientific super power? In Cartouche Bee's, Egypt weakened Persia, and Germany hit Russia, again at most one? Also, though it is hard to be sure from the descriptions, it sounds like perhaps there was more general warfare in both of their games, which of course could slow down research.<br />
<br />
I also wonder how much a different start (due to the non-saved RNG seed) could affect even the long term research rate. I sure agree that this (non-saved RNG) is not a good thing to have in GOTM! There are already more than enough luck factors in the game. Even with the same RNG seed, of course the rival Civs can evolve quite differently - a small difference in the player's early moves could result in a great divergence later in the game. But with an inconsistent RNG seed the divergence could happen even earlier and have a greater effect.</div></div><hr />

ICS ... I am sincerely hoping that it's not such an effective move that it will inevitably dominate Civ competitions<br />
Aeson and I have been comparing notes over time. In the 1-1 tourney game, I understand that he used a very dense build. I used an open build. Our domination date appears to be nearly the same!<br />
<br />
At this point I think that a dense build, properly applied, is just one more powerful technique to add to our inventory. Not a technique which is overpowering because other techniques can do as well. There may be exceptions - maps where a dense build with a Settler flood will perhaps out-perform any other approach. But that's not worrisome I think - if a technique is over-powering only on some maps that doesn't spoil the game. One more caveat: it may be that a dense build is THE technique for an earliest cultural win on almost any map...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suspect that most people that experience fast tech races do so cause they sell techs to the AI.<br />
<br />
Wars are definitely the biggest factor. AI's at war do not trade with one another, and they concentrate on unit building over infrastructure.<br />
<br />
I never HAD any tech not already owned by ALL the other civs on the planet until I paid for Synthetic Fibers at 3rd-of-5, with three civs already eliminated. That was... circa 1380AD. So your idea of selling techs to the AI's doesn't fit my game in any regard.<br />
<br />
I had a similar thought, perhaps blaming my cash feed to buy techs, but you did the same thing, so that's not it either. And you didn't do early war or big gambits, so those aren't it. Something was different, though. Perhaps a matter of who builds the wonders? And maybe, after all, whatever ICS you did could be an important factor, still. I haven't seen anything to rule it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm from the old Civ school and don't sell techs(all most never,well, if I want a quick space launch). This selling of techs is probably the factor that accelerates tech advances cause people assume that if they don't sell a tech then they miss an opportunity to recover some expenses.<br />
<br />
1.17f changed that for me. I was perpetually taking the tech lead and being stingy with it, timing the selling of a key tech now and then ONLY to prevent AI double-trades when they were researching down different paths. That was up through 1.16f, but in 1.17f they added the Screw You Factor, where the AI's would no longer ever pay you anything decent for what you might offer. You could no longer hold a tech lead by trading. You had to get them to ruin themselves in communism. War! It always comes back to the wars.<br />
<br />
<br />
ICS debates have been beat to death but on a standard map each map square [not accounting for curvature] represents a 250 X 250 mile area. So two cites would be 500 miles from city center to city center.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes: :rolleyes: :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
This isn't a simulation. Arguments about &quot;realism&quot; or lack thereof in the design for city density miss the point, in my view. Entirely. I've not weighed in on the debates, and frankly, I don't care. I know that some are bent to press the letter of the rules and some like me are not. I respect the results obtained with this strat, within the context of &quot;anything the game allows&quot;, but I also do not feel they represent the same game, any more than the old unlimited poprush or the infinite bombard range. I would bet that if Firaxis could find a way to defeat this tactic without major side effects, to take it off the table, there's a good chance they would do so. I don't see it happening, though; this flaw runs deep into the core elements of the game. That's my view, and this sort of argument won't influence me. The game (and the GOTM) allows it and on that basis you can do it. Enough said.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am learning to use ICS on outer perimeter areas, this is new to Civ3 for me and used to combat corruption and deliver culture to unholy infidels.<br />
<br />
Unless you are milking for score, you don't need distant cities to be productive. You don't need markets, cathedrals, hospitals. One cultural building (temple, library) to expand borders, maybe a harbor in some cases, walls if its not on fresh water (because walls are cheap and cost no upkeep) then let the cities build workers every 10 turns or settlers every 30, or wealth, or sit on shields pending a rush project. Two good cores is plenty enough production and economy to play the game.<br />
<br />
Of course, GOTM players have been milking, and that's great at the level where SirPleb and Aeson are fighting over maxing scores for the Hall of Fame: an exercise in perfectionism. I grok that and that's fine, but if that turns into the POINT of the gotm, well, that's why I've stayed away. No interest in doing that much work at what I consider to be the least fun part of the game. I played this one because the game looked fun, and it was.<br />
<br />
But back to corruption... each successive patch has gone more and more in the direction of reducing corruption in distant cities. I don't know about you, but I remember playing Emperor games in 1.07f in which cities about a dozen tiles from the capital were 90% corrupt! The only way to get anything done at the colonies was endless lumberjacking, and that was SO tedious that after one game of overdoing it, I was already burnt on that idea. They took that away in 1.16 but gave us police stations as second courthouses and reduced severity of corruption. Since then they've gone further. Now if you build a courthouse and run WLTKD you can pull a useful number of shields out of cities as far as two dozen tiles from the capital, on a standard map. Farther on larger maps.<br />
<br />
And you think cramming extra 1/1 cities in there instead is better? Maybe it is, but if so (I believe) largely due to not having to wait to build up the city. Plop down a bunch of small cities, they all pull in 1/1 right away. Put one full size city there and it takes time and effort to make it more productive. Civ3 is mainly about what happens early. ICS is just the logical extension of the basic idea of cramming cities together so that each has 12 tiles, and ignoring hospitals or the late game, because by then on ANY level short of deity (and often even then), the game is already decided. In that regard, the Civ III game design fails in an area where Civ1 and 2 did not.<br />
<br />
<br />
[/quote]But to go from researching Nationalism to launching a space ship in 48 game turns does seem a bit out of scale to me.[/quote]<br />
<br />
I should think so, based on 'standard' presumptions. Remember, though, I skipped all the optional techs but monarchy and democracy, and got navigation at one point as the only thing they would trade me for a spare resource I had. I did 40 turn research and pulled in five techs with it. I missed being the first to discover Polytheism that way (after popping Mysticism from a hut) by TWO TURNS. Two turns short of brokering it to everybody for max value! Arrgh. Then I did Monarchy that way, then Engineering, and was still waiting on Engineering when I had the whole top half of the tree, sans optionals. I had banking, democracy, astronomy, navigation, and sitting around waiting for the 40 turns on Engineering and building cash. I went up the lower side of the tree in a hurry, spending first all my cash, then buying in with gpt. I got as far as Industrialization and was flat broke (and selling maps for 1 gold to everybody every turn because I was THAT close to being forced to sell off buildings). I researched Corporation at 40 turns, 20 of which I sat on flat broke, the other 20 of which I caught up to Sci-Meth. THEN I started researching Nationalism because it was the one spot on the tree where I could wait 40 turns for a result, while I bought my way up to modern age. I ONLY needed Nationalism to get to Espionage anyway, so it could and did wait. That was the fifth and final one-scientist breakthrough I made, so I was not as far back as it may look when the Russians sent those mechs through. I was about three fifths of a an era behind at that point, since their progress had finally slowed.<br />
<br />
Besides, it was more than 48 turns. More like 70ish? You may have overlooked the time slowdown at 1250AD. Techwise, I was right about where you are in 1200, maybe a few ahead of you (I had combustion). Just, in your game, you're on par with or slightly ahead of the AI's, and in my game they would soon be completing the UN and Manhatten.<br />

<br />
The way the three scientific Civs evolve in this game would clearly be part of the difference.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that's even most of it. Russia and Persia in my game never chose to war against one another, so they were always open to trading. They were the tech leaders in the modern age, at the end, but they did not combine to defeat Germany. Cathy did that all on her own, and Persia plopped down two of its own settlers in the gaps. Japan was allied with Russia vs Germany but that was mainly phony, I presume.<br />
<br />
There was only one superpower and that was Russia. Persia may have been been about equal in economic power, though, since they never left democracy, nor did Egypt, and none of those three warred with any of the others. They all warred against Rome and England, and let Japan take the brunt for them over and over in the middle wars, and Rome and England fought each other, too, so the west was badly divided many times while the east remained united throughout. Perhaps that threesome pushed it ahead rapidly, and the deflation accompanying let all the rest keep up? Just the three in east could research by themselves three different techs every four turns. That's about the pace at which they swallowed the middle ages whole.<br />
<br />
<br />
I also wonder how much a different start (due to the non-saved RNG seed) could affect even the long term research rate. I sure agree that this (non-saved RNG) is not a good thing to have in GOTM!<br />
<br />
No idea. Could be this, could be that. If, as you suggest, a dense build (non-derogatory term for ICS? :lol: ) turns out to be a minor or irrelevant factor, I'd consider that a positive thing. At every level short of Deity, the player has his own fate in his own hands. On Deity, you may also, but surely to a lesser extent, and relying significantly on whatever means you have to pit AI's against one another in the &quot;best&quot; combinations.<br />
<br />
Research speed is a double-edged sword, though. I should think that anybody whose AI's research significantly slower than the ones in my game would have troubles matching my launch date, although maybe popping free settlers could override that?<br />
<br />
<br />
If a technique is over-powering only on some maps that doesn't spoil the game.<br />
<br />
I would agree to a point. Depends on how many are &quot;some&quot;. A few special circumstances where it doesn't work out would not meet that standard for me. And while &quot;the game allows for it&quot; is the primary standard for GOTM, I would argue that imposing some additional rules could further improve the game. GOTM already does that with some exploits. Dense building doesn't lend to that sort of regulation, though, so if it's too strong, it's going to rule the roost, I'm sure. We'll see. Maybe it's not that big a deal.<br />
<br />
Have you read the RBD13 game thread? In the SG forum. We tried a no-culture game, restricting wonders, disallowing any cultural improvements of any nature outside the two palace cities, and naturally this required a denser than normal build. The results were rather staggering, and what I thought would make for a rough game pretty much flew by easier than a standard game. After experiencing that, there certainly seems to be quite a bit at least to the notion of packing for 12 tiles per city or thereabouts. Maybe denser than that is of little added value, but at that stage all cities are still full strength until hospital time, and that's what matters the most. I won't be doing that on any regular basis, though. Some tools, I don't want in my arsenal. :)<br />

[party] :bday: My military gamble paid off bigtime, as a world war I triggered greatly slowed down tech progress, allowing me to catch up into the Modern Age and build the UN. It was pretty hairy for a while as Russia sent the bulk of their forces at me initially (LOTS of smoke and mirrors here; artillery saving my life, explorers ranging inland to pillage and distract attention, etc.) By capturing one Russian city, I managed to get horses for the first time around 1100AD, and the next turn a mounted warrior started a very conveinant golden age.

Since this is a tough Deity map and I'm making good progress, I'm posting a more detailed story than usual, in case some people want a detailed description of how a conquest can work on this map. If you don't want all this detail I apologize, please just skim or skip! :)<br />
<br />
It sure is a tough map. Not only is it Deity, the start position is limited in size and resources. But there are good things about it too: Horses are available (barely); expansionist exploring can result in profitable trading; Mounted Warriors can be powerful even when behind in tech.<br />
<br />
After moving the Scout at the start I decided that a four city dense build was likely in that area, and I settled in the start position.<br />
<br />
I built Scout, Granary, Settler in Salamanca. The Granary was ready before Salamanca grew to size 3 resulting in rapid growth. I eventually built up six towns in the start area.<br />
<br />
2390BC. One of my Scouts meets the English. I already know Russia and Rome, so this is a major trading opportunity. I trade contacts, tech, and gold for a net result of gaining contact with 3 more Civs (Germany, Persia, Egypt), 8 techs, and 8 gold (net gain from all trades.) I'm almost caught up in tech. I see Horses in the hills south of Salamanca. There's no sign of Iron anywhere near home.<br />
<br />
1990BC. Some nations have Map Making. I do another round of heavy trading, capitalizing on our maps. In this trading I learn all the other nations' maps (except Japan - no one knew her at this time) and learn 3 more techs, at a net cost of 77 gold. Now I can see much of the world. Most Civs have access to both Iron and Horses. We don't have Iron. There's Iron on the peninsula to the west, and Iron north of Russia. The Iron to the west may be hard to claim, Rome might get there around the same time. The Iron north of Russia will definitely be hard to claim. But it is their only source. Time to make an initial decision between builder or conqueror approach.<br />

Between the choices for Iron, I decide on the conquest approach. A tentative plan: I'll use a Scout to deny Russia the Iron north of her territory for as long as possible. I'll build up a force of Mounted Warriors and take that Iron. If I can keep Russia Iron deprived long enough, my MWs will be stronger than her defenders even if she has advanced technology.<br />
<br />
From this date onward I traded maps with everyone on almost every turn, for a small but important income. I kept a few Scouts exploring, and sent one Galley exploring, to keep adding value to my maps. My Scouts eventually opened about 10 goody huts to get not much: one tech, one warrior, 25 gold. The rest were deserted or maps.<br />
<br />
I stockpiled cash and paid tribute whenever demanded. I like to keep a good reserve of cash on hand in a Deity game. I am not sure of this but I think that as long as you have something of value, the other Civs are more likely to demand tribute than to simply launch a war without warning.<br />
<br />
1870BC. I've been watching for a chance to buy Workers every turn and finally get one from Germany this turn. Over time I bought a few more Workers.<br />
<br />
1830BC. I've produced our fifth Settler. This one will go south to claim the Horses. At this point we have four towns:<br />
Salamanca: Size 2, has Granary, is nearly finished Temple.<br />
Niagara Falls: Size 1, has Temple, is just starting Barracks.<br />
Grand River: Size 2, has Temple, is 4 turns from finishing Settler.<br />
Allegheny: Size 1, has nothing, is working on Settler.<br />
<br />
1675BC. Rome knows Japan. Another trading round results in our knowing Japan and her maps, learning four more techs, gaining a worker, and paying out a net of 50 gold. We're behind just one tech now (Polytheism.)<br />
<br />
1575BC. Russia has completed Pyramids in Moscow. If Russia wasn't already my target she might be now! :)<br />
<br />
1250BC. By now I've discovered the large unoccupied southern peninsula. My scouts went east and west originally and missed it. I send a Settler on the long trek to that peninsula, hoping to grow there. I ended up being too late of course, but our settlement in that area did eventually grow to three small towns.<br />
<br />
1225BC. I've finished the long road to our Horses and switch some cities to producing Mounted Warriors.<br />
I now have 6 capital region cities plus a 7th claiming the Horses. I'm rapidly falling behind in tech, have learned just one (from a hut) since the trading in 1675BC. Three of our towns have Barracks, two more are working on Barracks before switching to produce MWs.<br />
Our forces now consist of 4 scouts, 2 workers (plus 3 purchased ones), 1 warrior, and 1 galley.<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/SirPlebGOTM07-1225BC.jpg<br />
<br />
1200BC. Russia has had a town beside the Iron in her northern lands for a while. She now demands that I automatically leave. I agree. Next turn Russia has not moved a unit onto her Iron so I move our Scout back there.<br />
<br />
975BC. Russia demands automatic withdrawal again. I agree and again return next turn. (By now it may be too late for the Iron to help Russia a lot but I'll sit on it as long as I can.)<br />
<br />
925BC. I trade for two techs. After this I'm four techs behind: Monotheism, Engineering, Monarchy, and Republic.<br />
<br />
690BC. I have 10 veteran Mounted Warriors at Russia's doorstep. This is not the kind of overwhelming force I prefer to have when launching a war. But it is a force which has good odds. In a Deity game, and given the situation I'm in, that will have to do.<br />
My objectives are to gain control of the Iron in northern Russia, to capture The Pyramids in Moscow, and to try for a Great Leader.<br />
Since Russian culture is about equal to ours (and ours will outpace hers soon after our attack) I will capture cities instead of razing. This saves some effort since Settlers will not be needed. I will ignore the Russian outposts south of our homeland. I don't expect them to produce fighters. If they do it will be easy to divert MWs on their way from our homeland to take care of them.<br />
This will be the first war I know of in this game. The other Civs have just been quietly expanding. (I've purchased embassies with 3 of them by now - am not sure if there were earlier no-event wars.) Too bad - I'd prefer them to have been wearing each other down a bit.<br />
I begin the war on Russia, capturing one of her towns at the edge of the desert. We experience no losses in this initial attack.<br />
We enter a Golden Age - now we can produce new Mounted Warriors at a good rate. Five of our towns are working on MWs, two need to finish Barracks first.<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/SirPlebGOTM07-690BC.jpg<br />
<br />
Mounted Warriors are far better on the offensive than defensive. So after capturing the towns at the edge of the desert I kept the MWs there for a few turns. Russia sent Spearmen and Archers to recapture the cities. As they approached, my MWs used hit and run tactics to pick them off, seldom exposing themselves to counter-attacks. After a few turns I advanced again and captured the next city. I continued the same way, waiting out counter-attacks, then advancing. When attacking a city I was careful to do so from 2 tiles away, to avoid giving the defenders a cheap shot at my advancing MWs. I lost a few MWs (mainly to Horsemen, which Russia fortunately had few of, I don't know why.) Units from the homeland more than offset losses and I steadily gained elite units as the assault progressed.<br />
<br />
In 350BC a Great Leader appeared, after 13 wins with elite units. All objectives achieved: Pyramids, Iron, and a leader too! Also a bonus objective - I'd captured the Russian city controlling the southern gems. At this point I had 21 MWs, a number of them elite. GA production had far outstripped losses in the war. I gave Russia peace in exchange for four techs and three cities.<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/SirPlebGOTM07-350BC.jpg<br />
<br />
One of the cities I took for peace raised an interesting decision. Russia had settled Riga on the bottleneck south of home, blocking access between the eastern and western lands. Should I disband Riga or keep it? If I keep it, wars between eastern and western Civs will be ineffective. If I disband it, I will probably have large stacks of rival units walking through my lands with the associated risks. I decide to keep Riga.<br />
<br />
I made a blunder during my assault on Russia. When I decided I'd capture instead of raze I forgot to build the one Settler I'd need for Forbidden Palace if I got a leader. (Don't want to build FP in a captured town - even a small risk of flipping is too high to take with this.) I hurry a Settler from home - FP will be delayed by about 10 turns due to this blunder. I'll build it in a new city between Moscow and Smolensk, on the river.<br />
<br />
End of gruesomely detailed notes Phew! From here on I'll just write a summary:<br />
<br />
Soon after my war with Russia, my GA ended and I switched to Monarchy. Rome had been growing furiously and was becoming the world's strongest nation. Rome went to war with Germany. Soon afterward she drew in Egypt and then Persia, all at war with Germany. I sold Rome an alliance against Germany and joined the fun.<br />
<br />
In the first part of this war I hung back and picked off hordes of weak German units. A leader appeared (11 elite wins) and I used him immediately for Sun Tzu's.<br />
<br />
Early in the war I gained Chivalry (cheaply, as part of a peace renegotiation) and connected the Iron in the Russian north. I upgraded a number of veteran MWs to Knights. But I kept my elite MWs. I didn't have money to upgrade them but didn't need it! Elite MWs are about equivalant to veteran Knights in attack strength. And better in some ways - they can produce leaders and have a better retreat roll. So I combined a lot of elite MWs with a few veteran Knights in stacks. The Knights provided their full defensive strength to the entire stack - this combination of units works very nicely.<br />
<br />
With these forces I began a serious assault on Germany. I razed and settled - Germany's culture was much higher than mine. One exception: I captured Berlin in order to take The Great Library. It spewed out a number of techs, including three that it should not have. (Banking from the Great Library?) This seemed like a bug/exploit and bothers me - I don't want unearned tech. But I can't give them back. Time to rationalize and move on: I'd probably have gotten most of those techs from Germany at peace time. :) After the Great Library gave up its secrets I disbanded Berlin. (Thank you 1.21 patch!) I did not want it to flip back and then be captured by Persia - instead I built a new city on its ashes.<br />
<br />
Another leader appeared (17 elite wins.) I saved this one for a while - built Smith's with it a bit later when I traded for Economics.<br />
<br />
When my alliance with Rome expired I gave Germany peace. Couldn't get both of her island towns in the deal. Soon after that Persia razed her last mainland city but Germany remained (barely) in the game.<br />
<br />
During the war I'd traded for Military Tradition and now worked to connect saltpeter and then begin upgrading Knights and MWs to Cavalry.<br />
<br />
During that phase I took out the remaining Russian towns in the eastern lands. Another leader appeared during this. I'm still holding onto that leader now, many turns later, intending to use him for Theory of Evolution when the tech is available.<br />
<br />
I gave Egypt and Japan MPPs for a better deal on some tech, then declared war on Persia. My 20 or so Cavalry took out the big stack of Immortals near one ex-German now-Persian town, then rushed south to the Persian border. It was tough slugging but they captured a few Persian towns, including one with wines - a  much needed fifth luxury for us.<br />
<br />
And that's where I am now...<br />
<br />
Rome has grown furiously. She's been at war with England for quite a while and has been winning. She controls much of the western lands.<br />
<br />
I'm not yet sure which victory I'll go for. But it is essentially conquest of course. Certainly not space - if I'd wanted that then hammering the three scientific Civs as I've done would be silly, they're the ones that could have done fast research for me. I could still go for early culture, though for that I should probably have started filling in dense towns by now. A high score UN victory would be a good challenge from this point - I'd want to &quot;frame&quot; England for that I think. But I did that condition last month. So I guess I'll go for conquest or domination. It is still early in the month, lots of time left to play, so I'll probably milk it for a high score instead of going for an early win.</div></div><hr />

It sure is a tough map. Not only is it Deity, the start position is limited in size and resources. But there are good things about it too: Horses are available (barely); expansionist exploring can result in profitable trading; Mounted Warriors can be powerful even when behind in tech.<br />
<br />
After moving the Scout at the start I decided that a four city dense build was likely in that area, and I settled in the start position.<br />
<br />
I built Scout, Granary, Settler in Salamanca. The Granary was ready before Salamanca grew to size 3 resulting in rapid growth. I eventually built up six towns in the start area.<br />
<br />
A tentative plan: I'll use a Scout to deny Russia the Iron north of her territory for as long as possible. I'll build up a force of Mounted Warriors and take that Iron. If I can keep Russia Iron deprived long enough, my MWs will be stronger than her defenders even if she has advanced technology.<br />
<br />
690BC. I have 10 veteran Mounted Warriors at Russia's doorstep. This is not the kind of overwhelming force I prefer to have when launching a war. But it is a force which has good odds. In a Deity game, and given the situation I'm in, that will have to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Glad to see SirPleb had also gone military with Russia, that would at least convince many of you that it is a strat that will work!<br />
<br />
Great work done by SirPleb, I've learned a lot. The initial dense build and the scout disruption tactic were equally great. I have ployed neither of these two tactics, so I have had some trouble with Russian Pikemen. And my attacking date was far later, though it was still barely enough to get the plan work, it would not give a strong Iroquois when the war ends.<br />
<br />
290 BC. I have 9 veteran MWs at Russia's doorstep.;)</div></div><hr />

In Lawrence's game he weakened Russia and eventually Persia went after Germany. Sounds like at most one scientific super power? In Cartouche Bee's, Egypt weakened Persia, and Germany hit Russia, again at most one? Also, though it is hard to be sure from the descriptions, it sounds like perhaps there was more general warfare in both of their games, which of course could slow down research.<br />
<br />
<br />
I totally agree with your point in AI researching speed. However, in my game the Germans were able to remain as an advanced country until about 1350 AD, when Persia started to charge with their tanks.<br />
<br />
But neither of the two had got enough territory to be so strong. So the 'desire for more land' urged them to start wars, and the result you have all seen...<br />
:crazyeye: :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawrence</div><div class="date">May 07, 2002, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And my starting strat seems to differ from most of you. I saw many players used scout-&gt;granary-&gt;settler approach. I think that the out time for the second town is too slow in this strat. Here's my starting strat, open for discussion( excluding those who have got bonus settlers!!;) ).<br />
<br />
<br />
Turn 1: Settle, build scout, worker go to the bonus grass tile.<br />
Turn 2: Worker start to road and mine the tile, city work on this tile.<br />
Turn 6: Scout out. Build warrior.<br />
Turn 11: Warrior out. Culture Expansion. Pop increase. Build Scout. Worker go to the forest tile with game, city work on that tile. Warrior garrison to offset unhappiness.<br />
Turn 13: Scout out. Build warrior. Worker start to chop forest.<br />
Turn 15: Warrior out. Build Settler.<br />
Turn 21: Pop increase. Settler out. Pop reduced to 1. Build Wealth to offset cost by units.<br />
Turn 22: Change to build settler.<br />
Turn 23: Forest chopped, 10 shield returned to city, have city work on the grassland with game now. Worker road and mine the tile.<br />
Turn 25: Pop increase.<br />
Turn 32: Pop increase. Settler out.<br />
<br />
I think you can build a granary at turn 21 if you like. In my way 6 shields were wasted during the production of the second settler. But I've also got 2 settlers, plus 2 scout and 2 warriors, or 3 scout and 1 warrior if you like it. And I've got more roads in my empire.<br />
<br />
EDIT: If there's some timings wrong with this I apologize. It was written without entering CIV3. I've deleted the game to reduce the temptation of playing it over and over, day and night. Will re-install it when the next GOTM comes out.:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">May 07, 2002, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh! I have 32 Elite wins and still no Great Leader. I've turned the tide against the Roman infantry with artillery. The Romans are starting to conscript infantry so I know things are bleak for them and my allies have started to settle towns in their southern areas. The Japanese and Germans are both Gracious to me and my MPP with Germany is coming up next turn. I will try and renew that and use those 20 turns to work over the Romans. If I can remove the Romans I will control almost all of the western part of the continent.<br />
<br />
I have scaled back to Monarchy to alieve war weariness. The Germans are the scientific and cultural power at this point. Looks like we will hit the modern age about 1300 AD.<br />
<br />
Still not sure about the type of victory I will go for but I'm sure that it will hinge on how things go with the Germans at this point. I'm over half way to a domination victory but I would have to make up alot of ground by 1400 to settle for an early win.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elfi Wolfe</div><div class="date">May 07, 2002, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I lucked out in that the first two minor civ (goodies Huts) both pop setlers.  First one I placed south of captial where it wouldn't overlap the capital just to get it started the other i looked for a good site with the scout and found a good spot just as I found the russians.<br />
<br />
My plan was min sci, max money and go streight for Great library.<br />
most of my first workers sole mission was the prep the second city to make the great library.  The terrian was set up for max shield production with military unit doing martial law.  Traded for Masory so the city could start working on a new Palace, and adjust shield production so the palace would be built one turn after I got litature, so I could switch over to the great libary with the most shields.  finally got the great library (with 1 turn to spare, set up an embasy with the Russians and they were building the great libary, and it showed how long)  I would have had a screaming fit if I was 1 turn away from the great library and then lost all that production.<br />
<br />
With the great libary I was able to catch up with tech and trade tech with everyone (each trade improves the relation) so everyone is now happy or content with me.<br />
<br />
Second plan is to just send out settler constantly to sites already found by scouts.  When I say the land bridge south of me it was the second city founded by a made settler (as aposed to goodie hut settlers.) First city was north of capital, send two warrior, 1 setler and first production was grannery and now it is a worker/settler production facility.<br />
<br />
the City close to the russians set up a second city but now it is cut off by russian cities inbetween.<br />
<br />
Set up 2 cities in route to the land bridge (to grap the horses and keep a land route open to the south)<br />
<br />
and now i'm in a land grab race for the south, 4 settler was sent in a very long run down there to grab a nice spot with cattle and iron and it is working on the second palace.<br />
<br />
takes forever to get roads across mountains and jungles.<br />
<br />
well It just hit 10 AD, and I'm falling behind on tech again (the great libarary just became obsolite)  <br />
<br />
I don't think I'm going to live long, I got everyone friendly but with all my production going towards making the great libarary and setting up new cities my forces suck, and my taxes suck and my research suck.<br />
<br />
now my plan is to keep grabbing land, and to trade with everyone close to me with all the resources I have grabbed to keep them nice and just try to live though this.<br />
<br />
(new city production is warrior, temple,) so I'm got culture equal to most people and the point spread between the leader and me in last place is less than 100.<br />
<br />
EDITED<br />
<br />
Um I have only had one country demand stuff from me so far (england about 6 turns ago wanted my maps and 20 gold (out of 1000 gold) (2 civs payed me with 30+ gold a turn for techs)<br />
<br />
I was reading the others where the AI demands MPP, ect.  I have never had that happen in any of my civ3 games.  AI has never asked me for MPP or Demanded it either.  Is it my play style?<br />
Tend to be Civilized Expansiveness, Perfectionest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirian</div><div class="date">May 07, 2002, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">SirPleb: superb campaign. I did Temple-Granary-Settler, which put me in good stead for early culture and took care of MP, but did not have me as far along at the crucial 2000BC threshold. It looks like scout-granary-settler was definitely better. I also did not use a &quot;dense build&quot; but I did have some city overlap, pulling 5 cities in the area where you had 6. I would not have gone conquest anyway, but I did not get the chance. Since I did not build a second scout, and my one scout went south into the peninsula and cleaned up a ton of abandoned villages (got nada, but I see your luck was no better) I was also, apparently, a bit behind on making contact. I made about the same trades, except that I did not get contact with all, some of that had to wait a bit longer.<br />
<br />
I built my city in the horse region before I had Wheel, and then it was too late. Russia plopped down a city across from mine, with overlap on the horse tile, rushed a library before I could get a temple up, and throughout the entire game, I never had control of that tile, not even for part of any turn. My first horses came online in about 1340AD, with a source on the north side of Rome. I got myself shut out of horse access by way of luck in the horses appearing one tile out of my reach.<br />
<br />
Do you think you could have won the war against Russia with another civ? Say... England, Greece, or even Japan or Zulus? Would you have tried it with horsemen?<br />
<br />
A definite clinic on how to play the Iro's to their best potential. You captured a wonder, got an early second core and leader to rush the FP, and got it done without any gambles, and took a commanding position in the game. Superb.<br />
<br />
The scout-to-deprive move, I see that one as a loophole, in that the AI is not set up properly to detect the function and intent of your invasion. There's no way you OUGHT to be able to deprive another civ of access to resources like that, with a SCOUT, once they have settled nearby and the resource falls within their borders. Prior to that, sure, but to keep saying &quot;OK, we'll leave&quot; and going right back is treacherous, in the same vein as (though not on par with) Right of Passage abuse, and the game is not designed well enough to handle it. The moment they settle or expand borders, the game ought to require a military unit for you to do what you did, and the AI ought to recognize, after kicking you out once, that if you return again to sitting on an unconnected resource, it's an act of war. RoP betrayals are allowed in GOTM, too, so contempt for and abuse of the AI's is SOP here, but IMO this takes away a bit from what you achieved, and I would have liked to see how it would go without that tidbit. How much difference did it make? Then again, if you're going to be milking, your eye is on the bottom line, and you're content with the game balance as it stands.<br />
<br />
Do you really enjoy milking enough to keep doing it? For me, that would be a do-once &quot;to see if I could&quot; kind of deal. Am I alone in being baffled at someone taking time to do it over and over? How can you find the motivation to slog through the tedium when the game is long since over? You're paying a great deal of homage to a deeply flawed scoring system, at expense of game play.<br />
<br />
Your Russian campaign was brilliant, simply brilliant: well timed, well run, well done in every way. You could have moved your scout the moment they settled near the iron and not gone back. Why should you do that? Because the game is not competent enough to make you do it. But it should be. Shouldn't it? I know that playing video games always comes down to defeating the program, and knowing what its limits are and working around those is essential to victory. Where to draw a line between &quot;strategy&quot; and &quot;abuse&quot; is sometimes debatable, a matter of opinion, but is it your opinion that the ability to park on a resource is something that SHOULD be there?<br />
<br />
One thing I learned playing competitive Descent: competition is about both achievement and recognition, but many people confuse the two. There were lots of Descent players on ladders or in leagues who focused on the numbers of their records. They would avoid players they feared and single out those they were sure they could beat, to pad their stats. They would avoid taking on opponents in situations not in their favor. The raw numbers would impress some people, but the people they most wanted to impress, their peers, could see right through it, and in that regard it only backfired, as these guys were roundly discounted for their cowardice. It was particularly sad when they had real talent too, but wouldn't lay it on the line. Running up the score, padding the stats, angling their records -- however you describe it, the numbers, the stats took them over. The kind of recognition they truly longed for would elude them, and the insatiability of the pursuit of outside validation would undermine their standing in the end anyway. This would add to an illusion embraced by some, but mature players know how to evaluate performance, not just records.<br />
<br />
You've carried milking about as far as you can, don't you think? You set the standard in that regard, and it took a lot of micromanagement talent and patience to do so. What's to be gained from continuing? A place of honor in a contest so flawed that it declares as winner those best able to run up the score? Is that really worthy of your continued devotion?<br />
<br />
You're a brilliant civ player, and that goes way beyond your ability to wring points out of the scoring system. I picked up a few things new to me just reading your partial report, and I'm no slouch. So why do you cross the line and &quot;run up the score&quot;? That's not sporting, even if it is the yardstick of this contest. I propose to you that milking for score isn't worthy of your time. There's more to be gained with a graceful victory, whether or not it scores best in a flawed contest. You say you are debating between going for early win or high score, but I don't think either of those goals is automatically worthy of you. Either might be, in some situations, but based on the game particulars, not the standings in GOTM. Isn't the play the thing? Don't you see yourself giving up something of real value, in crossing certain lines to pursue the flawed extremes laid out by the polarities of Score and Early Finish? After all, the game itself is deeper than those two points can measure. They give indication, but that indication can also be corrupted, twisted, and abused, so it cannot be taken as a value measurement. Why must the scoring system be honored at all? Wouldn't you agree that to the degree its flaws fail to account for measuring real performance, that it is not worthy of being validated as a measurement?<br />
<br />
If you eschewed using the loopholes and put milking FOR THE PURPOSE OF FURTHERING YOUR POSITION IN THE RANKS OF THIS CONTEST onto the shelf, you'd make a bold statement (IMHO) from which you would only gain. Right now, you seem to be leading the field down the path toward milking. As you find new &quot;tools&quot; with which to inflate the score, and you and Aeson and a few others compete to see who milks the most efficiently on a given map, isn't something more important being lost in the shuffle? Don't you think it would be possible to demand a higher standard of yourself, this contest, and this community?<br />
<br />
Good luck with the rest of your game.<br />

Depends on how many are &quot;some&quot;.<br />
Sure does, I should have been more specific. I was thinking &quot;a small number&quot;. I guess that's only a bit better :) but at least a step in the right direction. To a large degree it depends on the definition of ICS. I was thinking in terms of a very dense build, where the density or pattern of the build is an overriding factor, outweighing almost all other factors (land grab, geography, etc.) in the player's mind. My feeling (hard to prove) is that on a large majority of maps, a thought-out (unpatterned sometimes denser, sometimes more open) build which plays to the map and the situation can compete with or beat any formula build. Factors which might make an ICS/Settler flood overwhelming would be things like: more room between Civs at the start; flatter land; pangaea; quiet barbarians.<br />
<br />
Originally posted by Sirian <br />
non-derogatory term for ICS? :lol: <br />
Yup! But there's another reason I use that term (dense.) I'm very fuzzy on what ICS means. I think that perhaps it is different things to different people. If I understand correctly (missed this bit of history) we've inherited the term from CivII play and it had a precise meaning there. In CivIII discussions it seems to be used for varying degrees of &quot;building towns tighter than is required to claim territory.&quot; (Am I missing something? Do you think there is a precise definition?) So rather than use the term &quot;ICS&quot;, which seems to imply something specific but I'm not sure what it is, I've tried to think in terms of &quot;dense&quot; or &quot;tight&quot; builds vs. &quot;open&quot; builds. Those terms seem more appropriate to convey the fuzziness of the concept in terms of how I play. At some times I build more densely than at others. But it depends on the land and the situation, not a formula approach, so I'm not worried about it being &quot;ICS&quot; :)<br />
<br />
I would only think of dense (or ICS) builds as being an unfortunately overpowering technique if there were a formula approach for doing a particular kind of dense or pattern build which worked on a substantial (there I go being vague again :) ) percentage of maps.<br />
<br />
Another perspective on this: The densest build possible is one town per 4 tiles. If &quot;tighter is more overpowering&quot; were true, should it not be that building one town per four tiles is the most powerful? I don't think I've seen anyone argue or demonstrate that to be true. If it is not true, that must be because there's a tradeoff somewhere - tighter is better only up to some point? If we can't clearly define that point then it remains an interesting tradeoff, and it won't hurt the fun factor in the game. (I hope we can't clearly define it!)<br />
<br />
There's definitely one problem in the game related to all this I think: One's rating on the powergraph seems to be too much influenced by the number of cities owned. It is possible to gain an appearance of power by settling more cities. I think this is imbalancing. But fortunately the worst part of this imbalance has been addressed in the 1.21 patch - it is no longer possible to demand cities in a simple peace renegotiation based on power. (Zero-turn wars can still be used but that seems clearly outside Firaxis' intent with the 1.21 change so I think it should in future be considered an exploit and avoided.)<br />
<br />
I hadn't followed the RBD13 thread, just went and skimmed it now. The pattern build used at the start makes nice sense for the no-culture variation, but that of course is a special situation. One city per 16 tiles doesn't seem a very dense build to me - did it get a lot denser later on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirian</div><div class="date">May 07, 2002, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding RBD13, packing isn't that tight in interior lands, and the capital even has control of its full 20 (not counting center tile). Along the shores, though, the build gets more dense, and FEELS even more dense than it is for lack of borders expanding out to sea.<br />
<br />
I only recently (thanks to Sullla) learned about the coastal/sea tiles counting for score, and coastal toward domination. Some things get missed when you hand out only in the boonies and avoid the crucible of something like GOTM where lots of talented players convene and share knowledge, test stuff, etc.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't call ANY tile overlap &quot;dense&quot;, but other than special considerations (very little land to work with, fresh water or lots of mountains in odd locations, etc) I would set the bar for &quot;dense&quot; building to start at 16 tiles per city and downward. Certainly anything aiming deliberately at putting all available tiles to use (12 per city tops) before hospitals would be very dense. Your homeland layout in GOTM7 is definitely on the dense side, though more along the lines of grabbing as much of the sea as possible in a &quot;make the most of a small homeland&quot; way, than packing for exploit purposes. Or so it appears. Certainly, squeezing in more cities made for stronger, faster army buildup, which seems crucial for early aggression.<br />
<br />
RBD13 was plagued by poor lands, so that too felt tighter. A lot of desert tiles, or cities with too much floodplain in a few cases, and lots of coastline. The number of cities that were &quot;strong&quot; in their own right is few, but having so many of them overwhelmed that, and the total power was just insane. That was aided by the UU we modded for that game, but it was a pricey unit, so we never did get large numbers of them.<br />

<br />
I hate to butt into your conversation (I'm not worthy! :) )but I couldn't resist. I tried ICS early on and it seemed that the old corruption model had blunted its appeal (I recall early threads supporting the old corruption model for this very reason). However the corruption model has been relaxed since then, and I wonder if Firaxis has inadvertantly resurfaced this old monster.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I've found that the best approach is to start off with a dense core of cities, and spread out as you move away from the core. Overlap just isn't a problem until later in the game when you're able to support those large pop cities (especially true on maps like this where there's no fresh water to be found), so it makes sense to make the most of your land early on at the expense of future expansion. It has more subtle benefits as well; workers don't have to lay as much road; settlers get built and settle faster giving you a few extra turns of early growth; your empire is easier to defend; overall distance corruption less due to dense core, etc. And thanks to the new 'abandon city' feature, you can thin out the core density if you need the space later in the game.<br />
<br />
Core ICSing is enough to get me a good head start, even on the more difficult levels, and that's usually enough to put me over the top overall.<br />
<br />
Finally, just wanted to give props to both of you. I've been lurking in your threads for awhile now, and your feedback about the game has been invaluable. You guys rock :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

Do you think you could have won the war against Russia with another civ? Say... England, Greece, or even Japan or Zulus? Would you have tried it with horsemen?<br />
<br />
It was very much an Iroquois strategy. The desert/plains/grassland in Russia were ideal for mounted units. The higher attack strength of MWs was a big factor. Triggering a Golden Age to produce more units to follow was another big one. And though not a big factor, I did enjoy the image of the MWs coming whooping down from the mountains :)<br />
<br />
I don't know if the same assault could have been won with another Civ. I wouldn't want to do it with Horsemen, too much of a gamble. I might go the same route with Egypt - 50% more &quot;Horsemen&quot; (War Chariots), faster road building, and would also trigger Golden Age at the right time. If intending conquest with any other Civ I'd go for something different. Probably start by going for the western Iron and waiting to see what opportunities developed for a while. With Japan or China a tentative plan would be to visit Russia with Samurai/Riders if no better opportunity arose.<br />

<br />
It sure is a loophole. The AI should have booted me out and treated my moving back as a hostile action. It would be great if Firaxis could fix this and many other loopholes. But &quot;contempt and abuse of the AI&quot;? I don't see it that way. No matter how good a game's AI is (and I think this one is very good) it will have serious blind spots. It has some advantages to compensate for this. (Number crunching ones. Knowing where to settle. Huge bonuses at Deity level. Constant trading at reduced costs. Etc.) I think it is a bit like playing chess against a much weaker player. I'll happily give a queen handicap. But will I subsequently ignore an opportunity to take an exposed piece, which a better player would not have left exposed? Not me - I'll set the handicap at the start, then play to the best of my ability from there on. If the game isn't fun on those terms then it probably isn't a fun game for me.<br />
<br />
Having said that, this particular example is at the edge of a grey area to me. If a game has too many blind spots like this, or if using any of them becomes too overpowering, then I think the game becomes less fun. One of the good things about GOTM I think is that we can collectively agree which ones are in or out. If some player(s) discover blind spots which lead to overwhelming advantage (and thus imbalance) then we can rule them out. I do think the resource denial move is borderline. I don't regret or apologize for using it. But I wouldn't mind having it explicitly disallowed either.<br />

I do still have some fun milking. I would guess that I spend less than 20% of my total time on a game in the milking phase. That part is more like working on a jigsaw puzzle I guess. There's no doubt of the outcome but the pieces need to be moved around and fit together. It also has some elements of &quot;finishing the job&quot;. It may well stop being fun at some point. If it does I might continue anyway. In a competition there have to be rules which establish a playing field and rules which measure results. In any competition there will probably be some parts which feel like work. Probably different parts for different people. At the moment we don't have a better way to compare results than by comparing scores. The score for a milked game will generally be higher than an early win. But between two milked games, the score for the one which was &quot;better played&quot; will generally be higher. So it isn't an invalid measurement. Matrix is evolving the system as clear improvements become apparent - it is now possible to shoot for awards without milking. Perhaps it can be further improved over time.<br />

<br />
Sirian, much of your note is thought provoking and raises many issues I think are valid and important. But these statements seem over the top to me. &quot;At the expense of game play&quot; seems debatable, it assumes a definition of game play. I certainly don't feel like I'm paying homage to anything at all. And to declare the contest flawed because the winner is best able to get a high score (or because the scoring system is flawed) seems a jump to me. I agree that the scoring system is weak. I'd love to see it well thought out and reflecting more elements of game play. But given what it is as a definition of a common goal, I don't think it is nearly so bad as to result in a flawed contest. It seems to me to be a very interesting and fun contest.<br />
<br />
Originally posted by Sirian <br />

<br />
I also have trouble relating to this statement. The concept of &quot;sporting&quot; is of course very important to me in how I deal with people, with a competition, and with the world at large. But I guess I just don't get how to apply &quot;sporting&quot; to my interactions with the game. At that level I am concerned about interesting, challenging, puzzling, rewarding, etc. But sporting isn't a word that figures there for me.<br />
<br />
I am having a lot of fun with the game. For me that's what it is all about. If it weren't for CivFanatics, GOTM, and now the tourney, I'd probably have stopped playing CivIII by now. Because of these things I'm enjoying the game immensely. I enjoy the random maps, the competition, the getting medals and trophies beside my name (yes, I really do like that part :) ), the discussions, the comparing of notes for the same map. I know that some have found other ways to enjoy the game but I'm quite happy with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hurricane</div><div class="date">May 08, 2002, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was my first GOTM, and I played it in a hurry in one 3-hour session. It comes as no surprise that I quit around 600 AD :o <br />
<br />
Anyway, I too had no luck with the goody huts (popped about 10, got 1 tech everybody already had and 50 g from another, all other were empty or gave maps). I had three scouts running around, and being in the middle of the world, I managed to get on par with everybody by selling communications and maps between the western and the eastern civs. This gave me all Ancient techs except the last few.<br />
<br />
I had earlier fought a small war with Russia to get the Horses (I guarded the spot with 2 archers but I had them fortified, and later noticed that the computer doesn´t show other civs´moves around fortified units, so they managed to sneak a settler in). I made peace for a few techs and built about 10 MW (and 2 catapults). I had been lucky with workers, being able to buy 2 russian ones very early, so I quickly got the road to the horses finished.<br />
<br />
By this time, Russia was at war with Germany, whom I allied with for 1 tech. I had little trouble advaning up to Moscow (they only had Spearmen).<br />
<br />
Then I made a serious mistake. I made peace and got 3 techs from the Russians as well as a city, but now I had broken my treaty with the Germans. I could not sell any of my precious furs, gems and spices for tech, only for gpt (which the AI almost never had). So I decided to continue towards the English while waiting for the Russian peace treaty to end.<br />
<br />
I never reached the English before the Romans demanded tribute of me. I declined and promptly conquered twp Roman cities which controlled the Silks in the middle of the map. The Romans started to move heavy reinforces against me, but stupidly I kept on fighting. I got one leader, but the Romans were too strong. I had to abandon the other city, and when I saw Cavalry moving up against me, I decided I had had enough and quit.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Hurricane, your game sounds like it was much better than mine - fight the Russians? I couldn't even begin to fight them! :lol: But you cannot - CANNOT - get away with refusing the demands of the AI on Deity. They WILL declare war, they WILL ally with every other civ against you, and they WILL hunt you down and get you. Or at least you cannot do so unless you have a commanding lead in the game, which is quite unlikely to come up. Keep in mind that their demands are normally on the order of 1 or 2 turn's income, which hardly hurts to lose. <br />
<br />
On the subject of alliances, when I actually did end up starting a war, I made sure every other civ on the planet except Russia was in a MPP with me; simply because Russia would have gotten them on their side quickly otherwise. If you ally with one or two other civs, you greatly reduce the likelihood of suddenly finding the whole world is against you. <br />
<br />
Also, I had played far more than 3 hours by the time I reached 600AD - probably closer to 13 hours, if not more. You wil do better by slowing down the pace and getting the most out of your cities each turn.<br />

I did set a city on the continental choke point. The major side effect for me was that I could ferry settlers down south. I tend to 'control' geographic formations to limit the free travel and expansion of the AI when possible. This move was fairly costly for me cause I was unable to acquire horses until much later in the game. Since I was on a peaceful mission this was not much of a problem. I muscled in later to get the horses culturally. :lol: <br />

It has some advantages to compensate for this.<br />
<br />
I disagree, SirPleb. The advantages are there to compensate for its limited intelligence, not for breakdowns in the rules of the game. I mark a distinction between the AI, which is the automation by which the program makes decisions for the players it controls, and the rules of the game.<br />
<br />
You are placing the onus on the AI to figure out your intent, or to suffer for not being able to, with the justification that it has advantages in other areas, so it's OK to cheat it.<br />
<br />
I place the onus on the rules. Your action was an act of war, and the rules fail to deal with that. When you settle on AI land, pillage their improvements, or attack their units, the game automatically declares war. You don't get to perform acts of war without a state of war. That's clearly the intent of the game. Blocking resources like this is an act of war, and I don't think you'd argue that since you knowingly did so as part of your war strategy. On neutral ground, you would have the right to do what you please, but once within their borders, that's a hostile act. Once you were kicked out, you should not have been able to return without the game automatically declaring war in the process. IMHO.<br />
<br />
You agree it's a loophole. What's borderline about it?<br />
<br />
The problem with laying the responsibility on Firaxis is the limitation of resources. Even today's PC's struggle with the true pathfinding in the game. Firaxis has limited processing power on hand. Even if they wanted to, and knew how to, resolve every flaw and loophole in their design, it wouldn't be practical for them to do so. They have only so many man-hours to work on it, as it is a business venture to them above all else. They have to turn a profit, and that places limits on them. They also have to deal with the limits of the computers, in that they COULD make the AI much smarter than it is now but that would mean expanding the time it takes to process, and their is an economy to that they must work within. Trying to separate intentional resource blocking from incidental resource blocking is a nightmare unto itself. They might well break five other things trying to fix this one point.<br />
<br />
Yet you, the player, could fix it easily, permanently, and effectively, by forming and adhering to a principle of adding your rule to the game, effectively. Where the game fails, and cannot hope to succeed, you could. Choose not to exploit the loophole.<br />
<br />
If you won't do so for its own sake, but only if that's a rule agreed upon for the formal contest, you have that right, but it is also an instance of placing your own results ahead of the value and integrity of the contest. I propose to you that that diminishes the result. Why? How? Two ways.<br />
<br />
First, it does show contempt for your opponent. You raise a chess handicap analogy, but the one you painted doesn't fully match. This is not a situation of a weak opponent, but of an unfair rule. It's not a case of you accepting a queen handicap and playing from there. Rather, it's more like playing with different rules for both sides. You take a queen handicap because you're a stronger player. That doesn't then entitle you to move your pawns like bishops in a certain situation. Nor does it allow you to arbitrarily forbid the opponent from moving certain pieces, which you then capture because they were prevented from advancing their position fairly.<br />
<br />
Second, there's a blur factor involved. It's not the same kind of blur as adding luck factors, but it has a similar result. Just because the same options are open to all may make it FAIR, but that doesn't make it healthy for the contest. Take a cheat code, for example. Say there was a cheat code that allowed you to make a one-time generation of 1,000,000 gold. You activate the cheat, which is not forbidden by the rules of the contest, and you then have cash to buy all tech instantly, rush whatever you want, etc etc. And others can do it too? And the results are still valid because there's skill displayed in how and when to best put all those unlimited resources to use? Yeah, sure, but it's not the same game any more, and I'd argue it's not as worthy a game.<br />
<br />
So with loopholes in the rules. This one doesn't have the scope or range of a million gold cheat (or call it a bug, maybe some flaw in the code where you can pull 100 gold for free out of some broken game element, and do it ten thousand times if you have the patience, and get a million gold free -- doesn't matter, same results), but just because it's not of the same DEGREE does not mean it's not of the same NATURE. The more of these loopholes in a game, the less real value to the contest. The results are blurred, diminished. The nature of the game shifts into being about something else: in my million cash example, about managing the expenditures; in the current scoring system, about adding population and managing territory up to but not past the domination limit, etc etc. That was not the intent of the game, and everyone knows it; likewise with the blocking of resources. The resources are clearly a huge part of the game, and so is denying them to the enemy, but this particular kind of denial is not functional. The cost that should be attached to doing it is for war to be declared. That you can get away with the benefit without paying the cost is in no waya gray area. It's definitely unsporting.<br />
<br />
You are perfectly within your rights with everything you are doing, but I am observing that your priorities are on the ends, not the means, and I do believe you are passing up opportunities in this regard. The means are where all (ALL) of the value of any game will be found. The ends provide form, direction, context, but never content. The stuff of the game comes in the playing, and when that is minimized and the ends exalted, everything has been turned on its head.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I do still have some fun milking.<br />
<br />
Fair enough.<br />
<br />
It may well stop being fun at some point. If it does I might continue anyway.<br />
<br />
That part I wouldn't understand. Or rather, I do understand, but don't agree with, and this is what I'm getting at.<br />
<br />
<br />
At the moment we don't have a better way to compare results than by comparing scores.<br />
<br />
Use your imagination. I can say right off, there are elements to this GOTM7 that render ANY comparison diminished in meaning, if not bereft of it entirely. Those who pull a settler out of that first hut are greatly advantaged, and this is made worse by lack of seed preservation (at least if seed were preserved, identical moves would yield identical results).<br />
<br />
Of what value, then, is comparing the results of games that do not compare? Apples do not compare to oranges. Those who draw a settler are playing a DIFFERENT game than those of us who do not.<br />
<br />
We do, in fact, have a better way to compare results, a much better way. We can look at more variables than are measured or accounted for in the scoring system. The scoring system only measures what it measures. It doesn't factor any of the luck.<br />
<br />
This map didn't have many variables for which directions in which to explore, but I've seen many that do, and whole games turning on decisions about which direction to send explorers. <br />
<br />
I just see it as foolish to force comparisons that are irrelevant, or to place more stock into measurements than they warrant.<br />
<br />
<br />
The score for a milked game will generally be higher than an early win. But between two milked games, the score for the one which was &quot;better played&quot; will generally be higher.<br />
<br />
That's my point. Between two milked games? The only way to meaningfully compare results with this scoring system is for players to bend their games to it, to play with the express intent of maximizing score UNDER this system. That can be done, but is it worth doing? Such hard numbers are required for GOTM style &quot;awards&quot; and &quot;medals&quot;, but I suggest that you have lost the spirit of the game here, and wandered off into a tiny area of the game called &quot;milking&quot; where submitting your gameplay to the requirements of score maximization have taken over.<br />
<br />
The rules of the game are flawed, but rather than addressing the flaws, you're adapting your gameplay to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
So it isn't an invalid measurement.<br />
<br />
I believe it is. What is being measured? You're right, it's valid, in the sense of being &quot;fair&quot; and also being objective and (somewhat) enforceable. But what is being measured? If someone puts in the &quot;good performance&quot; but then does not follow through on assembling the jigsaw puzzle (or is less skilled or less dilligent in doing so) they could still come up short.<br />
<br />
Valid measurement yes, but only of milking, not of Civ III play. It measures only what it measures. I, for one, will ignore that and focus in on more vital matters.<br />
<br />
I can glance at your game, see that you got no major luck boosts from huts, follow your moves through settling the start area, building barracks and massing troops, and through your campaign. I can measure that in my own mind far better than any scoring system, and certainly way beyond THIS scoring system. What do I need the scoring system for?<br />
<br />
I can also then extrapolate from there, in comparison to my game or anyone else's. Your moves get you to place X, with so much tech, cities, resources, military, wonders, etc. Your game from there no longer compares to someone else's in direct fashion, in terms of your moves. Your moves in 10AD-1000AD will not compare to mine, because we're facing different problems. At the end of the day, though, we can look and see where your choices led you and where mine led me, give nods in our own minds to moves the other made that were impressive, or see what was achieved within a certain subsection of the game based on the situation as it stood at that time.<br />
<br />
We both understand that the scoring system is not up to its task, but we differ on how to deal with it. You settle for it as the best available, and use it to compare what little it can measure, while I reject it as unworthy, and make my own subjective comparisons.<br />
<br />
My question to you is, regardless of the fairness or validity of a measurement, if the scope of the measurement does not extend far enough, what's the point of measuring? We do not have here a Civ 3 contest. We have a hybrid Civ3-Jigsaw contest with a side dish now and then of Bug Exploit. You're having fun with it, so that's cool. I plan to play the games that interest me, without a lick of energy spent in the direction of the scoring system.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;At the expense of game play&quot; seems debatable, it assumes a definition of game play.<br />
<br />
It does indeed! The game has victory conditions, and it has a scoring system. You are postponing victory to run up the score, and I don't see that as gameplay. Even you describe it as jigsaw puzzle assembly. I don't expect you to stop, but I do lament you pressing on with it, since it to the degree that you angle toward maximizing score, you stop playing the same game. Past that point, no further comparison can be meaningful.<br />
<br />
<br />
And to declare the contest flawed because the winner is best able to get a high score (or because the scoring system is flawed) seems a jump to me.<br />
<br />
Not to me. I'm not declaring it invalid, I'm suggesting that it's irrelevant to the core of the game, which is NOT the score or the scoring system. What's being measured is fine, but I see it as off the track, being led around on a leash by the limits of the available objective measurements.<br />
<br />
Some things are too complex to be measured with a few stats and numbers, and Civ III is one of them. When we try to force it anyway, we end up losing sight of what we set out to do.<br />
<br />
When you bought Civ III, did you envision yourself sitting around assembling a jigsaw puzzle? Is that what you came for?<br />
<br />
<br />
If it weren't for CivFanatics, GOTM, and now the tourney, I'd probably have stopped playing CivIII by now. Because of these things I'm enjoying the game immensely.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed GOTM7 immensely too, and some of that is the idea of competing or at least comparing, and sharing. I didn't have the chance to milk, as my peaceful expansionism was not sufficient ever to put me in control of the game, but if had taken control, I would not have used it to halt my domination/conquest and sit around running up the score on meaningless points vs defeated opponents. I don't see fulfillment for me in following the path of having to add milking to my gameplay as the price of admission to the &quot;comparison&quot;, though, and I would expect a majority of other players feel the same way too, if they stop to consider it.<br />
<br />
They want to be part of the competition, and some may be willing to venture into distinctly UNFUN territory in pursuit of the accolades, but it doesn't have to be that way. We might be able to shape a better contest, or we might forsake the scoring system and rely on subjective analysis. Is a trophy, ANY trophy no matter how off-the-path the contest it measures becomes, worth more than the inherent value of the game? <br />
<br />
Since the GOTM is focused on objective measurements, instead of judging, I do expect it to continue right along the same track it's always been. Might get better, might not. I'll jump in when a game looks interesting, pass on the elements of no interest to me, and be generally quiet in future.<br />
<br />
The RBD players are organizing our own tournament, essentially to cover the ground NOT covered by events like this, forsaking the prize elements for the subjective comparisons. I don't expect this to be at all in competition with GOTM, rather to be a different sort of group activity. Those wholly satisfied with this format and the gaming it inspires may not be interested, since there won't be any awards or standings, but it may appeal as an alternative to those who are somewhat restless with the unresolved problems of existing competitions, including this one.<br />

<br />
The fact that I called this &quot;doable&quot; is because there's nice land to the west, but across a sea. The only thing it you need to get Map Making pretty fast.<br />
<br />
Now for my game: it does not go well. I am amazed how hard deity is and I'm certain I'll loose. Just when I finished another settler to settle in the green area above the capital, the Germans built a city there (using the sea)! That's when I decided I got to have that city (very well located: it could get both furs with one time border growing), so I built four archers; unsuccessful. Three mounted warriors; unsuccessful. And now the Germans attack me from the south of course. But that too well protected (city with walls on a hill). I only might loose the horses.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's 630 BC and I still got four cities of which one is located on the peninsula on the west. Hell, I won't be able to keep my land. Someone will crush me. It's just a matter of time.</div></div><hr />

Whatever I thought was a fast time wasn't even close to the fastest in any other GOTM.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if I know exactly the best way to milk either. You have to kill off all the computer opponents and fence the last opponents last city so it can't make any more cities then go democracy and have lots of luxuries and everyone be happy with as many people as possible? Do you make a bunch of coastal cities because they have more &quot;happy&quot; people without having more dominated terrain?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawrence</div><div class="date">May 08, 2002, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally like the spaceship settings in Civ 2 more. It was harder to build, and it will take some years for it to fly to the destination, with the time affected by the structure of the ship. So if one player build a small ship and launched it immediately others would still have time to cope with it. Perhaps, they will sign a world alliance against him to try to destroy the player before he can win, or they can build more powerful ship themselves, or even try to achieve another type of victory. In CIV 3 it is all simplified to 10 parts and immediate victory. This, for sure damages gameplay. Great success can come from sneaky build projects, like what I and others have done in GOTM 7.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">denyd</div><div class="date">May 08, 2002, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...I survived to 1280AD, never fought a war, never lost a city, was into the industrial age for research (electricity) and had a string of cities from the top to the bottom of the continent. I also finished ahead of the Romans and almost caught the Russians (behind by 200 after being down almost 400 at 1AD)<br />
<br />
The bad news is I lost. Persia built the UN and got elected to end the game. I spent the last 500 years trading all my resources and luxuries for knowledge. I had 1-2 spearmen in every city, was able to build only 1 MW, 1 pikeman and 1 swordsman before I traded away the iron and horses. Was about to trade away both coals when it ended.  <br />
<br />
It's also good news that it's May 8th and I'm done and have the rest of the month for other diversions. The fact that there was no 'milking' in this game made it a lot quicker. I was a little annoying to have to trade my world map for 1 gold to everyone each turn just to keep in the black. <br />
<br />
This map didn't really suit the Iroquois strength, by the time the MW were available,in the east the Russians and Germans were way too big to take on and to the west was nothing but jungle, not what you look for when using MW. I feel pretty good in being able to survive and keep my little empire intact until the end. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tenpenny</div><div class="date">May 09, 2002, 04:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just finished my first GOTM, and I have to say it was quite enjoyable, though very difficult.  I've only played one or two games on Deity, and didn't do too well on those either.<br />
<br />
I rushed to MapMaking and was therefore fortunately able to establish 5 cities near the starting loc. and 4 cities on the peninsula to the west of it.  And that was about it for a long time until everyone around me started fighting, leaving gaps that my settlers were more than happy to fill in.<br />
<br />
Technologically, I was always far behind.  The AI wouldn't trade techs for anything.  They started their Industrial Ages before I emerged from Ancient Times.  My AI was very advanced in all regards, however - Germany built the Pyramids in 1950 BC for example.<br />
<br />
My Iroquois were peaceful people, and I built only one military unit during the entire game - a warrior at the very start in case there were barbarians.  I was fortunately well out of the way of the battling superpowers, and none of them ever felt like picking on me.<br />
<br />
Whoever won did it with a Space Race Victory in 1560 AD, when I was finally discovering Sanitation.  I wasn't running the AutoSave, so I didn't save my game before it ended and I won't be entering it in this month's competition, but I came in 5th at 1316 pts, with Germany trailing by one point, and Russia, eliminated early on, with about half my score.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, it was fun, and I look forward to participating in next month's game!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iver-P</div><div class="date">May 09, 2002, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Previous Installment:<br />
<br />
I forgot to mention that I got horses early and built one MW. Used him once and triggered a GA. That was much too early to do me much good.<br />
<br />
I had just refused tribute to Japan who proptly declared war and brought most of the world down against me.<br />
<br />
Reading this thread, I now see what a big NO-NO that was. :( <br />
<br />
Well, I was at 726 points in 1140 AD.<br />
My decline continued until 1355 AD at 712 pt.<br />
<br />
Russia went to war with the Germans leaving a few nitches for me to settle, to the west.<br />
<br />
After a few trades I finally got invention, but never really had much chance to build military.<br />
<br />
1540 at 731 pt. I have 1-2 defenders (pikemen or swordsmen) in each city as I watch mech inf patrolling borders and rolling along my dirt roads. Advisor says &quot;Compared to these guys we have a strong military&quot;!!! :rotfl: <br />
<br />
Well I continued the slow building process, and slipped in next to the Iron near Moscow (or was it Berlin?) Then built temple to culture expand and take it. That gave me an iron to trade with Germany who paid world map and about 30 gold. Russia had cut them down to only a few cities. :sigh:<br />
<br />
I was finally over in 1635 when Hiawatha the Meek suffered a &quot;humiliating defeat&quot; with 759 points.<br />
<br />
I agree that is is annoying not knowing who won or how. <br />
Had to go look at the score board to find out it was by Space Race.<br />
<br />
Suprisingly I did survive to the end. <br />
<br />
Now  a couple questions. Forgive me if these seem too basic:<br />
(Those forum newbees! :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
1. Is it possible to run other programs (like mapstat) while Civ3 is running?<br />
<br />
2. Early in the game Russia built an embassy in my capital, but no one else seemed interested. I wonder how other players handled their embassies. Did you build them early? Were you like me - I didn't build any at all (couldn't afford them)?<br />
<br />
3. Is it normal to trigger a GA the first time a UU wins a battle?<br />
<br />
4. What about that choke point? Seems to me that it was a very stretigic position, controling land movement N/S, and with a city creating a canal for E/W sea traffic. What did players do with it?<br />
<br />
Comments:<br />
<br />
1. Seems to me that if we are playing at deity level we should be able to create land bridges and move mountains. That would have been helpful in this game. &lt;chuckle&gt;<br />
<br />
2. Really though, it seems to me that a tech that should become available around Railroad (?) is canal-building. In the real world, canals have played a critical role in transportation, communication and security. In GOTM 6 I did build a Panama Canal in the middle of the starting contenent using two cities and the lake, but that is not really the same a digging an Erie or Suez Canal.<br />
<br />
3. Finally, could I suggest that those who want to discuss the pros/cons of a particular strategy take it to another thread unless it pertains directly to this particular GOTM? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">May 09, 2002, 10:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Iver-P's comments only add to the general conclusions I've been drawing about this game. The most interesting thing to me is the radically different speed of tech progression from game to game, which is almost entirely dependent on which AI civs are fighting and how much fighting they are doing. In my game the modern age was entered in 930AD, and it was even earlier in Sirian's game (850AD!) But other players have reported not getting to the modern age until 1300AD or even later. Iver-P's game didn't end until 1635AD? If I hadn't initiated a war, the other civs would have built the spaceship by 1250AD at the latest. One of the sobering results of this is that much of the game on Deity is wildly out of control of the player. It's pretty easy to manipulate the other civs on Monarch and lower difficulties, but on Deity it's just not possible to impose your plan on the game (in most cases). That's part of the reason why we're seeing results that are literally vastly different in nature (unlike GOTM6, where almost every game was a copy of the others). It's somewhat disconcerning to think that your game might have been twice as easy or twice as hard as another player's simply because of what the AI civs were doing. <br />
<br />
And to answer your question, it's entirely possible to run MapStat while Civ3 is running, at least on my computer. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iver-P</div><div class="date">May 09, 2002, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1635 AD its true. Matrix has the SAV files. I think the AI strung it out just to prolong my agony. Like picking wings off a fly. :lol: <br />
<br />
One good thing about the random quality of this game is that players cannot cheat (as much) by reading the Spoilers. Each game is different. Yes I know it promotes reloading, but we are on our honor not to do that.<br />
<br />
AND that variability gives more modest players a chance at a prize if they get lucky.<br />
<br />
BUT the top players may complain that luck should not enter into this competition. Well, in the long run, luck should balence out. The best players will still rise to the top of the global ranking, right?<br />
<br />
My question re: MapStat - Yes of course I figured I could run it. But how do I get to my desktop or toolbar to see it? Civ3 always runs full screen. (Somehow I have the feeling I will be responding with a Doh! soon, but that's the way it is.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JediSloth</div><div class="date">May 09, 2002, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whats the best way to lose? (seriously, read on )<br />
<br />
This was my first ever attempt at diety level, and for a while I thought things were going well, 2 early settlers  from goody huts and I think a tech.<br />
<br />
So I got 5 or 6 cities going very quickly, :)  then put 2 other citys further south one on the horses one near the gems. Was giving cash gifts to the russians, the idea was to keep them as a happy ally. But I didnt pay attention to how they were doing, and a short while later they were killed by the germans.<br />
<br />
By this time I had an force of about 15 MW so I thought 'What the hell' and attacked germany who were already at war with persia. Between us we got about half of germanys cities each, with me finishing off germanys last city. Problem was no leader appeared and corruption was so bad that it took an age just to build a spearman defender in each city, meanwhile persia got gunpowder, (I hadnt even got iron working at this stage).<br />
<br />
This is where I made my biggest mistake (I think), I thought about attacking persia - there newly conquered cities seemed to be poorly defended, and I still had a dozen or so MW's at full health.<br />
<br />
Instead of attacking immediately I decided to take a break to build some more units, and to try and aquire some tech.<br />
<br />
Got Iron working from english - then discovered nearest iron deposit is on other side of the bay - crap. Send settler on hastily built boat across and found city, realise building a defender and a harbour will take ages.....<br />
<br />
Traded gems and furs and extortionate amount of gpt for gunpowder - then find nearest saltpeter deposit is far to the east - through the middle of persia :( <br />
<br />
Made do with building more MW's and giving in to demands from all and sundry.<br />
<br />
Marched to attack persian held city of berlin, find out to my horror that persians (and everyone else for that matter) now has nationalism AND cavarly. So I halt at the border again, and waste several more turns trying to decide what to do, income is all being swallowed up by the upkeep of my troops, and am still stuck in ancient era, everyone else is in industrial.<br />
<br />
Trade some furs to the english for saltpeter, and start building some musketmen.<br />
<br />
Suddenly Persia declares war, and at that moment I realise they have steampower and have built railways from their well developed core cities right up to and past berlin, to right next to my entire force of MW's. <br />
<br />
The MW's were stomped by cavalry in one turn, and I lost the first couple of my previously german cities. After that it was just a scramble by me to try and abandon cities and make a last stand in the mountains on the peninsular.<br />
<br />
To really rub salt into the wound, persia got nearly every other nation in the world to ally with them against me (like they really needed the help  :cry: )<br />
<br />
I only got peace in the end by giving away all my cities except my capital for a peace treaty.<br />
<br />
So back to the original question: is it worth even carrying on? or should I just pick a fight and go out in a (very brief) blaze of glory?<br />
<br />
I know this is a sort of spoiler/cheat request, but as we have to 'complete' the game (ie not retire), I would just like to know the best (most painless) way of doing so, rather than spending 100 turns pressing 'return' then get wiped out in one turn by another civ.<br />
<br />
Cheers all</div></div><hr />

My game isn't over yet but it's only a matter of time.  I hated the starting position so I sent my settler south.  What did I find?  MOUNTAINS!:mad:   Of course the Russians to the east had grassland and a river!<br />
<br />
The mountains looked like a dead end so I walked my settler all the way back to the rotten start position.  The round trip only took about 2500 years.:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
By the time I got back and built Salamanca my scout had found the choke point beyond the mountains, traversed the jungle and found the wide open promised land that I had looked for.<br />
<br />
Of course it was too late by then even though that land was still unclaimed!:cry: <br />
<br />
Around 800 AD I got tired of the bullies taking my lunch money and told Ceaser to go pound rock salt.  He declared war and proceeded to land a rifleman and archer one turn and 2 infantry and 2 longbows a couple turns later.  My spearmen defended valiantly and I ended gladly paying Ceasar much more than he originally had asked for.  BUT: my spearmen had defended my cities and my country was intact.<br />
<br />
500 years later I've just upgraded to pikemen in time for my only iron to run out.  Secured am MPP with Rome 'cause Russia just wiped oout Persia.<br />

Well, one of 'em should launch the ship pretty soon and this nightmare will be over.</div></div><hr />

There are lots of notes about milking techniques on this thread: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=18729<br />
<br />
Basically as you are thinking, kill off all but one controlled rival, then build for territory and happiness. Coastal tiles are good if you can get the sphere of influence to expand to include some sea as well.<br />
<br />
At 1300 you've played 250 turns and have 290 to go. A useful reference date I keep in mind is 1400AD - that's the halfway mark, 270 played, 270 remaining.</div></div><hr />

The demands are usually at most 1 turn's income, so I hardly feel like I'm losing much. And of course they will be paid back later...<br />

I haven't even played half the game yet? It took forever to dominate the world and now I have 7 armies and I could sweep in and win instantly. Are you going to milk every game you play SirPleb or are you going to try for a quickest something? Maybe the last 290 turns go a lot quicker than the first 250. <br />
<br />
Iroquois Pangeas (IP) are my specialty. I've played more of those games than probably all the others put together. I've played easier and harder IPs before but this was one of the more exciting probably because it was a GOTM. The worst IP scenarios are when it isn't really a pangea but 2 continents, I hate those. I never pick so many mountains either. Only getting 20 shields for the first forced pop rush was a bit of a setback but I got used to it. I think the fastest I won an IP scenario was around 2000 BC on a tiny map when a horse was next to my starting city and I popped horseback riding and a settler after the first couple huts. That was back when rushing was king. Aztecs are just sad now with the rules changes.<br />
<br />
About the tech race, I don't think tanks will ever be discovered in my game. Its 1295 AD and Democracy hasn't even been discovered yet and it will take me something like 19 turns with 100% sci and I have 80 something cities. I suppose I could do 7 techs in 280 turns and get tanks at the end of the game but wouldn't that just cause pollution? I know how tech can get away from you in Deity level games. I got totally crushed in my first Diety level game playing as the French. Space race ENDED something like 1050 AD. I was stunned. The stupid English had their own island and won before the Russians could win a domination victory. I learned about IP scenarios here on Civfanatics and I found I loved them. It was just great! I thought Diety level couldn't be beaten without a custom map or something.<br />
<br />
I'll have to learn how to win a diplomatic victory someday. Is there some point where the computer opponents become permanently furious and you can't win a diplomatic victory no matter what? I never won a cultural victory until the last GOTM and it sort of happened by accident. :love: It has a different ending. I'm so used to the domination ending I forgot there were different endings. I rape and betray the computer at every opportunity, I'll have to stop doing that if I want to win a diplomatic victory. I just can't resist attacking a settler when it moves by my borders. I always see two free workers.</div></div><hr />

That was the first mistake :mad: <br />

the second mistake happened earlier when the japanese were making demands offof me. i got pissed and refused figuring &quot;theyre too far away too attack&quot;. then after a while i forgot i was at war w/ japan (they never attacked) and they formed an alliance with practically everyone against me!!!! I managed to get my two closest neighbors (russia, persia) to stop attacking me, but they took nearly all of my spearmen garnisoned cities (Persians had calvary!) i gave my last city away for peace (no money no science) and only my capitol left.. im on republic... its 700 AD i wont last much longer :cry: <br />

It was funny watching me block a 5 gap pass to Russia with 3 people- a worker, scout, and warrior.  Russia had 6 settlers and 6 spearmen all trying the exact same path each time so I would just move the three one step either direction.  Had it split the 12 people apart they could have easily gotten through.  I had a city there as well, but the AI seems to disregard borders.  And if you chastise them about it they just teleport to the other side anyway.</div></div><hr />

You had the right idea about attacking the Russians, you just might have done it too late. If you build enough mounted warriors fast enough you can always win. You have to know the right time to make peace too and when to buy alliances. You didn't need any technology beyond horseback riding to win because of the effects of the Great Library. When you get the Great Library you get every technology in the world presently researched even past education. Iron working helps to have so you can see iron to deny it to the computer but that about it for early tech. Without iron and horses all the technology in the world doesn't help you until you get nationalism. The mounted warrior dominates until the advent of the musketeer/knights and even then its pretty powerful because it is cheap and easy to rush. You just have to make the push to Military Traditions (usually 1-3 techs after Great Library) and cavalry dominate until the advent of infantry but infantry require rubber otherwise the computer is stuck with riflemen who can be plowed by cavalry. Armies, armies, armies. The importance of armies cannot be over emphasised.<br />
<br />
I loved the whole east-west blockage dynamic. That's what made this such an interesting map to play, that and the resource distibution.<br />
<br />
I've done that settler block trick before. If the computer has a path to its desired spot it will always try to move there but if you block it completely it will build a city right where it is and force you back with its cultural radius.<br />
<br />
You can play Iroquois Diety games on Tiny-Small maps in about 1-3 hours (about one evening's play) I suppose you could win in about 30 minutes on sub-diety difficulty. It really helps to play a couple dozen of those to polish your diety skills. In last months game as the Indians I beat my nearest neighbor into submission (actually right out of the game) with warriors since it was Warlord level, imagine how easy it would be with mounted warriors. The elephant is awful and actually a penalty since it can't upgrade to cav. I'd rather have no UU than the elephant.  The mounted warrior by contrast is hands down the best UU in the game.</div></div><hr />

I see you answered your own question :) Unless you're going to go for an early war and get ahead of the AI that way, you really can't leave anything for the AI to demand from you. I always traded my luxuries as soon as the deals came up for renewal, simply because the AI would demand them from me otherwise. I traded all contacts immediately as soon as I found the western civs for the same reason. If you have something good, get rid of it before it's demanded from you.</div></div><hr />

Archer99, have you ever considered playing the game without using exploits like this? It's entirely possible to win on Deity without building the Great Library (or capturing it), or by playing peacefully. After all, I did it in this game, and so did Sirian. Please don't take this the wrong way, but you are certainly using an exploit in the game by playing this way, whether the GOTM considers it &quot;legal&quot; or not. It's no wonder you've never won by the UN if you break so many deals! :lol: I am very much against players blatanly abusing the ROP betrayal to gain enormous advantages like this. I would challenge you in future games to try and win on Deity without using these kind of exploits; I would imagine that you are probably a much better player than I am, so I'm sure you can do it. :) But focusing your whole playing strategy around betraying other civs to capture the Great Library? That doesn't sound much different than the endless whipping exploits of the pre-patch days. :(</div></div><hr />

I assume its a bug that was not intended. On the other hand if one presupposes that libraries contain a lot of information and the civ that owns it has passed well beyond education, then capturing it would presumably reveal information on later echnologies as well. <br />
<br />
As far as the exploit aspect this is another thing that would be impossible to control in any case. I suspect if it was not intetnional then the bug will be fixed in future. Its a bit surprising thats its not been addressed to date if it is in fact a bug. On the negative side the existence of this bug adds another element of extreme variabilty to diety games since a lot would depend on which civ built the GL and how acessible they are.<br />
<br />
On the other side of the coin breaking all those deals carries a penalty as well when you try to trade for later techs.</div></div><hr />

No it jsut floods tech beyond the education when you capture it then goes obsolete the same turn. SO basically you will jump up to the current state of knowledge discovered by other civs.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely. But it's a fragrant abuse of the AI, and clearly not the way the game is meant to be played. I recognize that players will do this because it provides an enormous advantage, but I hope that some will have the decency to avoid an exploit like this and respect the way the game is meant to be played.

I sign RoP to sneak attack. The game doesn't let you do this over and over you know. You do it once and its a very long time before you can do it again. If I actually tried to pay the absurd amounts of tribute I agree to, it would bankrupt my nation and I can't afford to lose all my temples and barracks. The computer does RoP sneak attack to you if you don't do it to them first so first strike is totally legit. Success through betrayal is historically accurate in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

BS.<br />
<br />
The computer will sneak attack, that's true, but it's nothing like what you do. It's not even on the same continent, much less in the same ballpark.<br />
<br />
If there are rails, they will move ONE unit to the target of their choice and attack, war is declared, and the rest of their units then have to contend with your cultural territory under war conditions.<br />
<br />
If there are no rails, they will move along your roads, and they move stacks around prior to being able to get a unit to their target of choice, but NEVER with the intent of &quot;moving into position, then attacking&quot;. They attack their chosen target at the first opportunity.<br />
<br />
You move all the units you want for the attack into position first, then attack. Correct? So your justification that &quot;the AI does it too&quot; is dishonest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Success through betrayal is historically accurate in my opinion.<br />
Spare us. You admit that your playstyle is based around betrayal. The game does not in ANY way accurately reflect the severity of consequences that befall those who betray to the degree that you are undertaking, so falling back on history as a defense for your strategy goes beyond ludicrous. Way beyond.<br />
<br />
Relying on &quot;historically accurate&quot; is a double-edged sword that will slice your tactics to ribbons. Let's take the &quot;Right of Passage&quot; betrayal, and stipulate solely for the sake of argument that an ally would ever be stupid enough to allow your nation to move its entire army into attack position outside the city with their Great Library. You betray them, attack, grab all the scrolls, burn the city to the ground and run. You're deep in their territory and would have to get that knowledge home to do anything about it. Most if not all of it would be lost or destroyed in the process. Where is the historical accuracy in your civ jumping from backward boobs to enlightened state-of-the-art learned men by setting foot into a library? They don't have fax machines for you to call up and send facsimiles of the scrolls home, and there's no way to copy the contents of the entire library onto a hard drive and smuggle it out before anyone knows what happened. Doesn't work that way. I could go on here, point out the absurdity in historical context of all the various forms of betrayal you've outlined, but what's the point? You don't care, and anybody who does will see through you anyway.<br />
<br />
The fact that you are one mind who has godlike power over not only national policy, but armies in the field, research, everything, and not for one lifetime but the entire timeline of the civ, leaves &quot;historically accurate&quot; entirely out of the picture. Nothing about Civ III steps anywhere near the concept of &quot;historically accurate&quot;. The history elements provide flavor and context for a play-as-god build-and-compete game. That's all. Therefore the only legitimate justification for anything in the game, is the game itself, and you show contempt for the game and abuse it and its limitations at every turn.<br />
<br />
The game allows you to do what you do. You don't need justification to do something the game allows, but don't try to pretend you're playing within the spirit of the game. Nobody is going to buy it. You're following the rules of this contest and you're entitled to play any way you please. Sullla is also entitled to call a duck a duck, if it quacks.<br />
<br />
A term that comes to mind for what you do is &quot;legal cheating&quot;. The laws -- the rules of the game -- are not well enough written to cope appropriately with your tactics. Not that what you do should be disallowed, but the consequences for doing so ought to be more appropriately severe.<br />

<br />
I am not a MP fan, but I do tend to play based on the idea of &quot;would this get by anyone in MP?&quot;.  There is no way a real human opponent is going to let you set up shop on top of their iron, and around their capitol under the guise of a ROP.<br />
<br />
You can bet that a real opponent would either attack you first while you are in the open, or would do what I would, set up equal force around your capitol and resources...hey it's a ROP, fair is fair, and if it looked like you were going to attack my GL, I would sell all of the knowledge to other civs to get a alliance against you first.<br />
<br />
Your tactic might work once, but you would be earning quite a bad reputation throughout the MP boards, something that would carryover to your next games.<br />

The computer has 7 generally cooperative civs all with a substantial head start and a 66% advantage in tech and shields ongoing. You have to exploit something to win. A human player with Diety advantages would never be defeated by another human player under any circumstances so saying if a human would let you do something is a ludicrous measure of what should be allowed.<br />
<br />
Taking years for modern ships to cross the ocean is equally realistic as hauling away the knowledge of the library over the 25 or 50 years it takes for the city to be reconquered (if it ever is). I think 25 years is plenty of time to learn how to use guns and make armor and whatnot.<br />
<br />
If the computer played as well as a human it would not need diety level advantages to win but the computer doesn't feel bad when it loses and the point of a game is for the human to have fun. Just because the computer is as inept at pulling off a sneak attack as it is every other aspect of the game doesn't mean it isn't trying to use the same tactic I do.<br />

What makes civ 3 good is the variety of ways to tackle the game. I don't think everyone should be straightjacketed into winning the exact same way.

I'm just saying that nobody wins by accident on Diety level. ... You have to exploit something to win.<br />
<br />
Maybe you do. I don't.<br />
<br />
Golf has a handicap system that, nominally, is aimed at giving players of different skill levels an equal chance to win any given round. Players with high handicaps get advantages comparable to those given the AI's in Civ3 on higher difficulty. Players with lower handicaps embrace the system to make the game more interesting for them, rather than a foregone conclusion.<br />
<br />
Increasing the difficulty level in Civ3 is not required of you. You can play at dead-even on Regent level, where the AI's play you straight up. The AI routines and algorithms are adequte to defeat many novice players. The AI's ARE skilled, but their skill level is limited, and they suffer from an inhuman level of predictability.<br />
<br />
There is a difference between outplaying an opponent and exploiting the rules. You do have to outplay the AI's by a huge margin on deity to win the game, but it can be done and has been done without exploiting loopholes, gaps, and flaws in the rules. Betrayal is intentionally part of the game, but the rules governing that side of the game are incomplete in some ways, incompetent in others. Some things it would be easy for any human to figure out are too complex for the AI to deduce. Either the programmers can't code it, or the code would be too resource-hungry to be practical. Does that mean you should exploit it, just because you can? Does the ability to get away with something mean that you should do it?<br />
<br />
If you'll do this to the AI, because you can get away with it, what else might you do because you can get away with it? The game is incapable of enforcing some rules it has or which are implied, but likewise, this tournament is incapable of enforcing all of its rules, either. Is there anywhere that you will draw a line other than &quot;I can get away with it&quot;? If so, where? And why there?<br />
<br />
Things you can do, but choose not to do, are called principles. I would expect (hope?) you have some of those in real life. If you do, why? Because there is something to be gained in choosing NOT to do certain things. Some things you could do, and nobody could stop you. They might penalize you later, but they could not prevent you doing those. Other things you might be able to do and get away with, that you would still not do because they harm someone else or yourself. Setting principles and adhering to them enriches a person's life. It also enriches the gaming experience. If you find value in adhering to the rules of this contest, and not reloading or not secretly adding workers to whip camps in a way that would be hard to detect, not hex-editing your save file or employing mods and hacks, or not breaking any of the other rules, why not extend that to the rules within the game?<br />
<br />
You're feeding us a line. &quot;Deity AI has so many advantages, you have to cheat it to beat it!&quot; That's just not true. And don't bother to try blurring the line any more in regard to the AI's tactics. If you buy an alliance with a third AI, who is closer to the AI you're targetting than you are, then knowing that your target will likely send its offensive forces at your ally, leaving its territory lightly defended for you to go attack, is not an exploit, that's playing the game. Making trade deals then pillaging a road, over and over, to wring free goodies out of a system inadequately complex to detect what you are doing, is not beating a dumb opponent, it's cheating the game. And you know it.<br />
<br />
You can do it if you want, but don't tell us it's the only way to beat the game on deity. I beat GOTM7 without cheating on any of my diplomatic deals. I didn't even go to war at all until the modern age, so up until the endgame, everything I owned I built on my own, acquired on my own, or bought or traded for in deals that I honored. I did have to maneuver the AI's into war to slow their launch or I'd have lost, but I did not send all my army on a RoP Rape to take out their spaceship. I set up my alliances and went to war the old-fashioned way, and let the chips fall where they fall. It was good enough to win, and all the more satisfying to me to beat the game by playing, rather than by exploiting.<br />
<br />
It's not even about keeping your word. You can break deals, make betrayals, up to a point. But there's a difference between making an alliance with one nation, then betraying them to ally with one of their enemies -- which is clearly within the spirit and intent of the game -- and a RoP Rape, which is clearly a loophole in the rules. Or silly road pillaging, as if some nation would ever send out its trade caravans and then mysteriously go home and shrug their shoulders if the road was a little torn up, and just forget the whole deal -- especially if they paid in advance. They would demand their payment back, or they would be extremely upset about it, or they would insist on continuing the deal the next year, when the road has been repaired.<br />
<br />
Betrayal deserves its due and its place in the game. That's how Firaxis wants it. But they have been clear about rebalancing the game and closing out loopholes through the patch process, too, so there are clearly moves players are undertaking that Firaxis designers do not like. Some of those problems can't be fixed, as I already explained -- just like the GOTM cannot enforce its rule of no reloads. Some things have to go on the honor system.<br />
<br />
Deity is there to pose an extreme handicap. You're only half a step short of going all the way over into cheating. You've got the rationale in place. You are already there in spirit.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Matrix, are you reading? You've got a few exploits listed as known but allowed. Why?<br />
<br />
If they are allowed for lack of enforcement ability, because you do not believe you could detect them, I submit to you that this is inconsistent with the no-reload rule. If the honor system is good for the no-reload rule, it would work just as well for any other rule you choose to implement.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if there is some rationale for why RoP Rape and a couple other loopholes are OK, would that same rationale not apply to the loopholes and exploits you've marked as off limits? That's the part I don't understand.<br />
<br />
I can understand a contest that says, &quot;If the game allows it, it's OK.&quot; I can understand a contest that says, &quot;We recognize flaws in the rules of the game, so we're adding our own rules to cover these areas. Here's a list of known exploits, they're all off the table.&quot; What I don't get is picking and choosing among the exploits, these are OK but these are not. Doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
If you recognize it as an exploit, doesn't that mean by definition that you know it's against the spirit of the game?<br />

For at least 100 turns after a RoP betrayal no computer opponent will sell you anything. No one will ever loan you money or pay anything upfront ever again. If you break trade deals and alliances they eventually want 7 luxuries and 2 resources for 1 luxury but when you have 7 of the 8 luxuries and many multiples of each you can afford to be &quot;generous&quot;. It got to the point where I couldn't buy a tech everyone else had for even 3000 gold, but once I had military traditions nothing else mattered. You can force them to give you in war what they would never give you in peace, over and over. <br />
<br />
The Romans would never make any agreement with me nor any trade. They always threw the German thing in my face even after 3000 years. Of course eventually I beat them into submission. After the 3rd forced surrender they even agreed to an RoP. I really liked that. The Romans being all snooty for 3000 years finally submitting to unconditional surrender. The Romans blew it when they traded the weakened Egyptians military traditions and I was able to force it as a term of surrender. 50 turns later the Romans were giving away the secrets of Replaceable Parts and that was game, set and match. In my game the Romans were king because they never let themselves get drawn into all the conflicts I forced. The diplomatic penalties are staggering but a conqueror cares not about such things since terms of surrender have nothing to do with diplomacy AFAIK.</div></div><hr />

I am currently creating a webpage about my game that will lay out my game in detail; you might be curious to see a game that played out completely in contrast to your own. :)<br />
<br />
There's no need for me to say again why I disagree with your playing style, as Sirian has done a far better job than I ever could. There is no way that the reputation hit is in proportion to the abuse that the human deals out; it should be more on the order of every other civ in the game immediately decalaring war on the rogue civ that committed such a heinous offense, and not ending it until that civ were destroyed. What do you think the response of the world would be if the US suddenly turned on its allies and used the troops were have stationed in Europe to raze a city like Paris or Berlin to the ground? America would become an outlaw state; it would be attacked by everyone else on earth and destroyed. How could anyone ever make a deal with such a civ again? But you said yourself even the Romans gave you a ROP after a long enough time, which I'm sure you used to take out their remaining largest cities. The problem is that you gain too much from this with too little penalty; as many as over 20 techs for free at the cost of &quot;no more trade deals&quot; is no penalty at all. <br />

There seems to be alot of the pot calling the kettle black going on here. When one states they 'pull out the old smoke n mirrors' or admits to 'diplomatic tricks' and then complains about another's strategy as exploitive, then I can only consider the argument as insincere and classify it as 'trolling'.  <br />
<br />
Cartouche Bee, do you really think that the argument that Sirian and I make is &quot;trolling&quot;? 'Smoke and mirrors' is a phrase that has grown up in the RBD succession games that refers to using a mixture of bombardment units, pillagers, and anything else that can be scrounged up to hold off overwhelming enemy forces. In my game, that meant using 5 artillery and 2 infantry to hold off a stack of over 20 Russian infantry by bluffing and feinting at various targets while bombarding them down to size. This has nothing to do with exploiting the game, it's a matter of using what meagre forces you have in a strategic way to hold off massive enemy forces. <br />
<br />
My 'diplomatic tricks' consist of things such as being the broker for all world contact, the world map broker between civs, trading resources for the maximum possible value, buying a tech at 4th civ price to trade with another civ for a different tech at 5th civ price, and getting a MPP with every other civ before starting a war with Russia. In short, diplomatic tricks means using the diplomacy system to get the maximum value possible out of what resources your civ has. Diplomatic tricks fall far, FAR short of what Archer99 is describing. At no point in time did I EVER break a standing agreement with any civ. Period. <br />
<br />
I'm increasingly coming to the conclusion that the only way to score highly in the GOTM is to use massive exploits of the AI in order to get more score. Hey, it's all about who comes in first, right? How you get there apparently doesn't matter. Ever since I first saw (in the forum for GOTM5) someone say &quot;Russia was so much stronger than me, so I HAD to use a ROP to take them out lol!&quot; and others claim this was a great strategy, I began to have my doubts about the purpose behind the competition. I love the GOTM, and I personally could care less what my score is - it's all about discussing the game with others and seeing what I can learn from it. But if the GOTM is all about seeing who can abuse the AI the most to rack up the most points... then maybe I'm not so interested in playing the GOTM anymore. :(</div></div><hr />

&quot;Smoke n Mirrors&quot; means getting something accomplished when it would appear you do not have the resources to do so. This means being creative, it does not mean being exploitive. For a clear example of what I mean by smoke and mirrors, check out This Report (http://sirian.warpcore.org/civ3/game7.html).<br />
<br />
I didn't want to give out all the details of every move I made in GOTM7 and hand advantages to those yet to start their games or still in the middle of playing them, who are reading this thread, so I referred to them as diplomatic tricks. I intended to talk about them later.<br />
<br />
What happens when I put those cards on the table and turn out not to be a hypocrite? That's not going to look good for you, if you're attacking my credibility on that basis.<br />
<br />
If my goal were to troll, that would have made itself evident long ago. I've been around this board for five months now, and my forum history here speaks for itself.<br />
<br />
You're actually validating my criticism of Archer99, since there is an implied stipulation of my points in &quot;considering&quot; my argument to be insincere, accusing me of being a black pot. You admit the kettle is black but challenge my right to complain about it. :lol: I'm sure Archer99 appreciates your support. ;)<br />

<br />
Because you can diplomatically trade and sell items to your advantage over the AI that has not been programmed to realize that you are manipulating them, that's OK.<br />
If you can 'confuse the opponent' in battle in a way that allows you to leverage your strength to win because the AI has a typical response pattern then, that's OK.<br />
If you can use espionage in ways superior to the any concept available to the AI, that's OK.<br />
If the AI attacks me on a ROP like the Romans did to me this GOTM game, that's OK.<br />
If someone attacks the AI on a ROP that is NOT OK.<br />
If the AI builds ICS as the Romans did in my game that's OK.<br />
If I build a ICS that is NOT OK.<br />
If you play to achieve points that's NOT OK.<br />
<br />
I would contend that a smoke and mirrors tactic is no different than the ROP attack.<br />
If you exploit the AI in ways that you are happy with then have at it, if you think that your exploits are intellectually superior fine, to me they are also just exploits.<br />
<br />
Directing the actions of players in succession games may be appropriate but not here in GOTM. That's my opinion.<br />
<br />
If you want to attack peoples tactics and hide it under the veil of opinion, good for you. You can fool some but not all.<br />

can you make a canal by setting up a row of city centers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archer99</div><div class="date">May 11, 2002, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AFAIK, its just the abbreviation for the primary goal of every civ and the standard victory conditions. I've not seen the term used in a clear context so I'm not sure where the acronym comes from or what its specialized meaning is, if any.<br />
<br />
Last time I checked the game didn't let you put two cities on adjacent squares nor on mountains so I don't think you can make a canal across a thick section of land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bamspeedy</div><div class="date">May 11, 2002, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that the I and C stands for Infinite City.  The S some people say stands for sleaze, I think maybe it originally stood for style or span.  It's the process of putting cities only 2 or 3 tiles apart (1 or 2 spaces between the center city squares).  Some use this at the very start of the game.  Giving up territory area, but make up for it with an early leverage and lower corruption (not many cities far from capital, and cities will be sharing terrain improvements as the population goes up and down from settlers and workers, quicker defense).<br />
<br />
After placing the first 2 or 3 cities this way, then some players space their next cities farther out to start gaining more territory and resources.  Some players continue this pattern pretty much throughout their empire.   A dense build gives you a very early advantage, and the only drawback is later in the game (when you get hospitals), your cities will not reach size 25+, but the game should be pretty much won by then.<br />
<br />
It's possible to make a canal using two cities (I used it in GOTM6).  This will only be possible if there is isthmus that is 3 tiles wide and there is a lake right in the middle.  Otherwise, no it's not possible.</div></div><hr />

OK, let me get this straight:<br />
Here comes the obfuscation. OK, bring it on. :)<br />
<br />
Because you can diplomatically trade and sell items to your advantage over the AI that has not been programmed to realize that you are manipulating them, that's OK.<br />
That's called business. Buy Item X from Party A at Price N, sell X to Party B at N+, turn a profit. This is not exploitation, and yes, it's OK.<br />
<br />
If you can 'confuse the opponent' in battle in a way that allows you to leverage your strength to win because the AI has a typical response pattern then, that's OK.<br />
No, not necessarily. Sullla offered his understanding of smoke n mirrors, but I coined the current usage and that's not my definition.<br />
<br />
In RBD9, Cyrene discovered that sometimes an AI tends to call back its entire army. I followed on the next turn, and tried out a few things, and pinpointed that sending troops into range of an enemy city does kick in a stimulus AI response in which they abandon their current target and send everything they have toward the threatened city. This Army-Wide response, wherein ALL the offensive units of a civ get essentially the same mission on every turn (with a few local target-of-opportunity exceptions) is a most unfortunate weakness of the AI. I spotted this as an exploit at the time, but I have not used it since, not as puppet strings. If Sullla is using it, that may be exploitative, but it may not be. Just because the AI is mind-numbingly dense and one dimensional at times does not mean you do not get to play the game, though. Sending a diversionary attack or using the chance to counterattack where the enemy is weak are, in general, legitimate war tactics.<br />
<br />
Another example of this &quot;confuse the enemy&quot; dilemma is in LOTR2, Always War variant. We declare war at first contact with all civs and never accept peace, so the game is nonstop war end to end and an interesting struggle of attrition as our civ fights off continuous invasions by all the others. Just because the AI's will turn their entire army around and run off on a wild goose chase if we send out raiding parties to go pillage some of their lands, should this take the option to do so off the table for us? No way. On the other hand, if you stick one unit out there somewhere and hop in and out and in and out of range of an AI city, just to paralyze their entire army in a back-and-forth go-nowhere dance, yes, that would be exploitative and, IMO, not OK.<br />
<br />
So who am I to say what is or is not, what should or should not be OK? I'm just another player like any other, yep. Tis true. But I have the right to voice my opinion. Who are you to declare that because the issue is subjective, I don't have the right to state my opinions about it? You're nobody special either.<br />
  <br />
If the AI attacks me on a ROP like the Romans did to me this GOTM game, that's OK.<br />
<br />
The Romans did not move a whole army next to one of your cities, abusing the RoP (and the turn-based nature of the game) to move everything into perfect attack position while you are paralyzed because you're not &quot;up&quot;, then attack you.<br />
<br />
If someone attacks the AI on a ROP that is NOT OK.<br />
<br />
Correct, that's not OK in my view. You understand why, so you aren't doing your point of view any good by equating what Archer99 is doing to what an AI does. They don't compare.<br />
<br />
If the AI builds ICS as the Romans did in my game that's OK. <br />
If I build a ICS that is NOT OK.<br />
<br />
The AI's never, ever, EVER build a city within two tiles of any existing city. More obfuscation. They won't build within three tiles in most situations, but sometimes they will. They do not do ICS.<br />
<br />
If you play to achieve points that's NOT OK.<br />
<br />
It's OK, but is it worth basing a contest around? When the GOTM was conceived and put into play, was it with the idea of setting up a row of cows and seeing whose bucket would have the most milk in it at the end of the day? The fact that score is also hugely influenced by early warmaking, which has until the current patch been the sovereign realm of poprush exploits, indirectly links milking to exploiting, since the two converge under the scoring system. But... I admit, you can milk the score without exploiting, so even though they often go hand in hand, they don't have to.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can disagree with the lines I draw and limits I set on my own gameplay, but you here disputing the right for me (or anybody) to draw lines and set limits would put you at odds with the GOTM, which has at least two rules of things it has deemed to be Not OK, and with SirPleb, who has detailed his understanding of exploits but indicated he sets his limits differently than I do. You... you don't believe in limits. Do you? Well so what. I do, and I think the contest would be more meaningful with a few more limits. It's Matrix's and Thunderfall's contest, so if they disagree with me, nothing will change. What's it to you either way?<br />

Glad we both got to express some opinions.  :lol: <br />
<br />
I know that the exploits that you use are tactics developed after much study of the game. Your own descriptions and terminology from your first few posts lead me to believe that you knowingly used tactics that you believed were exploits. Apparently you used them cause you had no choice if you were to win in the position that developed. On the other hand, it seems pretty hard to expect the other participants not to use the tactics that they learned and developed, based on your action.<br />

I definitely won't milk every game :) Last month it was a toss up for me to go for early space or late diplomatic.<br />
<br />
The later turns start going quite fast once everything is railroaded and all city improvements have been built. Up to then can take a while getting everything in place. The amount of effort for those things depends on how early you control the world - it is nice in this regard if the other Civs have already railroaded much of the territory before you capture it.<br />

They do seem to become permanently furious at some point. I don't know what the limits are though. I'm pretty sure that razing even one of their cities goes past their limit - after that they're permanently furious and will abstain rather than vote for you. I know for sure that you can war a number of times with a Civ, kill some of their units, culture flip some of their cities, and still recover relations to get their vote. And you can raze other Civs, it doesn't hurt getting a vote from the ones you are not razing. Some things I don't know about either way: capturing their cities, launching a nuclear war against anyone, breaking a ROP.<br />

With your style you might end up learning more about the furious limit for us! :lol:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I learned what ICS was. In the game where I disabled all victory conditions other than diplomacy and there was never a war and I didn't build any military other than a few garrison units in the beginning. Cultural assault is just as brutal as attacking someone. You wedge a bunch of cities up against their border and push back the radius. When the radius gets pushed 2 in, build another city and push more. Its amazing how you can sever an empire when cities are placed 5 tiles apart without crushing them with overwhelming might. You can steal resources just as easily as you deny them using explorers. If I had used this technique in my GOTM, I could have made each initial assault that much more brutal because I'd be able to reach their cities in a single round (trading ICS exploit for RoP betrayal) and had more flexibility (using rail and roads with my cultural radius) instead of having to use those tall combined arms stacks like the computer.<br />
<br />
The new abandon city feature is great. It makes it so much easier to flex your empire when setting up milking. I have to build 6 transports in a pangea game (imagine that!) to transport all my armies, elite infantry and explorers to scrub Japan clean so I can freely milk. The individual cav can clean up the rest of the continent now that no one else has any resources. Their wonders are worthless anyway.<br />

Did anyone notice that Hanging Gardens has 3 happy faces on it even when its supposed to be expired? Are those still having an effect in the building city? Its hard to tell with so many different types of unhappiness.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you had some real fun, good! The building of cities close to your targets so you can wedge right up to them is good and very powerful. Quite often you can get the AI to declare war and save your reputation. Once in war you can build cities right in the AI's cultural sphere as close as 1 square away from their cities and quickly over take the cultural zone of control of even their most powerful cultural cities.;)<br />
<br />
ICS should give you a good shot at some real good milking and if you get the diplomacy win also you could grab 2 medals on this run. Good Luck!<br />

Everyone is their usual permanent furious. I won this game with the 7 turn destruction of the entire German empire (who absorbed the Russian empire)which doubled my power on the graph immediately and it just went up from there. You'll be able to see it when the games are posted. The wide German part tapers to a fine point and disappears and my bar gets a whole lot wider.<br />

The city governor really good now. You can tell it to keep maximum happiness and never use tax collectors and scientists and you can let it build the improvements you want to build in every city by setting the growth and commercial to often and the other bars to never.</div></div><hr />

Your own descriptions and terminology from your first few posts lead me to believe that you knowingly used tactics that you believed were exploits.<br />
<br />
This is the third consecutive post you've made with the sole intent of painting me as a hypocrite.<br />
<br />
I see the game as more complex than &quot;exploit&quot; and &quot;nonexploit&quot;. There are actions and moves that, if conducted in real life, I would see as good. I categorized these as Honorable. There are actions and moves that, in real life, I would view as detestable, and these I label as Dastardly. The context of the game is intended to support both of these. &quot;Evil&quot; moves -- betrayals, broken deals, unprovoked aggression, strong preying on the weak -- are intended to be options in the game.<br />
<br />
Then there's a third category of moves, things that undermine or show contempt for the context of the game, which offer a &quot;free lunch&quot; in some way or other, rewards wholly out of proportion to the rest of the game. Exploits. These are options not intended to be in there, whose presence disrupts or even destroys the game balance, diminishing the whole exercise IN THE SAME WAY as a hack, cheat code, &quot;trainer&quot;, etc. Most of the exploits are in there on the Dastardly side, so that might be confusing you. I did indeed express distaste at some of the moves I made, but then to presume that could only come because I'm exploiting the game is the same baseless assumptions you've been making about me all along.<br />
<br />
I played a peaceful expansion game and I WANTED to play it all the way through with only Honorable moves, but turned out I could not do that and win. So I had to pull some Dastardly moves, mainly including lining up the world against one nation solely because they were about to win the space race. That's a pathetically selfish and evil reason to cause the deaths of thousands if not millions, even virtually, and yes, it's dastardly. But it's not an exploit. I also jumped in there and pounded the remnants of a broken civ just to ignite a late golden age, and that too was dastardly, but it's not an exploit. A few times I ran interference of enemy units crossing my territory to delay them getting to the other side, and delay their pounding of the enemy, but they had no right to be traipsing across my lands in the first place. Often I had to fortify a unit on one tile of a bottleneck to stop them clogging the whole thing up and preventing my workers and units from getting by. Most of my &quot;diplomatic tricks&quot; involved a matter of whom to give my money to for the techs, and why, and how to mesh that with any other deals, and the resources I had available and the possible buyers for those resources. None of these are exploits.<br />
<br />
I did momentarily ponder the RoP Rape to attack the spaceship, since that is specifically allowed in GOTM, but decided I'd take my chances within the context of the game instead. We don' need no steeking exploits. OK? Even if it means I might lose the game.<br />
<br />
You're out of line and off the mark with the hypocrite charge.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it seems pretty hard to expect the other participants not to use the tactics that they learned and developed<br />
This is patently absurd. Aeson pioneered the add-workers-to-whip-cities concept as a way to continue to get unlimited poprush in 1.17, but GOTM expects him not to use that tactic here. What about the poor souls who have developed the &quot;tactic&quot; of reloading the savegame and doing things over if they don't like the original results? GOTM expects them not to use that tactic. What's &quot;hard&quot; about the idea of labeling some things as outside the context of the game, and making them off limits? Where the game itself fails to do so, it's up to us to plug those gaps.<br />
<br />
SirPleb understands the distinction between &quot;what an exploit is&quot; and &quot;what the rules of the GOTM are&quot;. If the game allows it and the GOTM rules allow it, it's legal for this contest, but it may still be an exploit and harmful to the spirit of the game. I've made that point enough times now. If you don't get it, you don't get it. Feel free to continue with the blowhard accusations of hypocrisy, though. Maybe if you say it enough times, you can persuade a few people on force of persistence.<br />
<br />
<br />
DaSilva: My apologies. I said my original piece and that got all of this started, so I'll take the responsibility, all of it. I don't consider it off-topic since it has all concerned GOTM7 spoilers. I've said my bit now, though, and even finished defending myself against Cartouche Bee's diversionary campaign, so this subthrust should settle down soon. I'm sorry the game didn't go well for you, but I hope the beer was good! :)<br />

Sirian, that's the second time you've characterized my understanding and used it in your arguments. Though I have no interest in prolonging this discussion, I do feel that I should address that:<br />
<br />
I do not think you understand my thinking, limits, or principles, nor that you understand those of other people in this discussion. Please do not assume that there is any qualitative difference in my thinking vs. those you are attacking here. (On re-reading all posts in this conversation, it seems clear to me that you've repeatedly been the one to throw stones. I realize that you disagree with that of course.)<br />
<br />
I don't want to debate this stuff, just wanted to ask you to stop assuming what I think. I'm going back to having fun and playing the game. :)</div></div><hr />

The discussion so far on the philosophy of the use of exploits/actions/moves allowed in the GOTM has been healthy and interesting but it should not dominate this thread which is based around the sharing and comparing of our games. Can I suggest that it moves to another? I will stilll follow the debate :D .<br />
<br />
To my game.......<br />
<br />
It is currently 680AD and I was playing a  peaceful expansion strategy from the begining which I lost badly. I did beat the Russians to the gems but lost the chokepoint and hence the lands to the south.<br />
<br />
Mistake 1. Sent my scout east through Russia and missed the vital chokepoint<br />
Mistake 2. Did not build another scout!<br />
<br />
Life was horrible and I thought it was going downhill when my diamond town flipped to the Russians trapping me in my peninsular. Concentrated  on getting a temple and library in each town. Have I mentioned I am still only in the Ancient Age :( .<br />
<br />
Mistake 3. Did not get early embassies into the other civs and they now cost a fortune.<br />
<br />
After a period of consolidation with my 7 cities (Ha!) I switched to minimal reasearch (Well I was an age behind) and tried extracting blood from a stone (read: trade for techs) with my fingures crossed as the &quot;annoyed&quot; Russians are tramping their rifleman/settler stackes passed my mountain spearman &quot;wall&quot;.<br />
<br />
Managed to cultivate a polite trade  relationship with Persia and moved my focus to the lands in the west as I had no easy way to get down south which was plan 'A'. I had hoped to get a 1 sheild per turn FP going for a laugh.<br />
<br />
Panicked when Russia went to Cavalry and Infantry so negotiated a MPP with Persia. This was OK until they went to war with Rome putting my westland expansion at risk. Actually the first Roman war was OK as I held onto my town until I could negotiate peace getting two Roman settlements. The Germans had cities razed by Roman Knights which I filled. I put an embassy in Rome traded furs for dyes which got an &quot;annoyed&quot; relationship. With five towns on in westlands (my mood more optimistic) I crossed my fingers.<br />
<br />
With three turns to go before I could cancel my MPP, Rome attacked Persia invoking my automatic assistance, and in the same turn razed two of my cities. My mounted warriors are running out against the Cav. Need Peace!<br />
<br />
It is 680AD and I am still in Ancient Age with my GA about to run out losing money in tributes and embassy setups.<br />
<br />
My trading sucks! I went out looking for construction and every AI wanted the contents of my treasury, 5 gold per turn and World Map, even my 'gracious' Persian allies.<br />
<br />
Not sure what to do now. No money, tech, culture, power, :cry: I think I will keep the peaceful expansion up once I get out of my MPP and Roman War. My goal is to keep out of trouble, cultivate diplomatic relationships, fill the gaps in the Roman/Persian war with settlers to try and get some city bulk to increase the limited respect I get from the AI. Any Civ at this stage can take me out so I need them to focus on each other.<br />
<br />
Long term goal is to survive. Only option for victory (Ha!) would be for a Diplomatic unless masses of cheap techs come my way.<br />
Did I mention that I am still in the Ancient Age;)</div></div><hr />

Next I'm gonna try trading luxuries if I can link any up, but I'm not holding up much hope - We offer Silks, furs, horses, etc. We want 1 gold &quot;They'll be insulted by this deal&quot;...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just to follow up, I was absolutely right about trading luxuries rare to see any worthwhile trade. Although once I got three techs from Persia for silks it was a one off.<br />
<br />
My game is a little confusing to assess, as far as I'm concerned<br />
 I'm cannon fodder.<br />
<br />
Tech: All the other civ's have had infantry for hundreds of years...I've just got democracy.<br />
<br />
Diplomacy: All Civ's are annoyed/furious with me.<br />
<br />
War: Strangely I've had successful wars against all the other Civ's.  I really can't fathom this as they are all so much stronger techwise and numbers.  I've taken several small cities defended only by spearmen then settled for peace four or five turns later getting tech out of the deal sometimes too!<br />
<br />
My only saving grace (apart from luck) appears to be land area: I have the most land, and all the resources/luxuries I need. It's about 700AD and I'm not sure how to win from here.  <br />
<br />
Another oddity; I'm lowest on score but the score graphic shows me with the highest (not culture or power but score).<br />
<br />
I'm so far behind technically Space race is out, I don't have the tech/micght for Conquer, or the culture for Cultural win.  Can I still make a diplomatic victory? With the most land are I should get a nomination, but how too get everyone to like me considering one of them will build the UN without a doubt...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know how you feel, it's 700AD I'm doing marginally better as I got the choke point to the south , *just*, and I've expanded south with my only Great Leader for the FP (1 settler, 1 spearman, 1 GL ooh risky!) it's developed quite well although the English and Egyptians have small cities near the FP city.<br />
<br />
My Eastern reach is to the border of Kiev in the desert east of the southern chokepoint you mentioned.  My Western reach is through the jungle to the Iron source  at the choke point there.<br />

The Russians wanted my furs; I didn´t want to give them away for free. They declared war as I expected. I thought that I could hold my cities because I had controll over the mountains.<br />
Big mistake.:mad: Persia declared war too.<br />

Waited some turns until my score didn´t increase anymore, abadoned my cities and got conquered.<br />

The have only one island so I refused. They sent over 1 archer to try to take out my capital :lol: <br />
I am hoping that they are truly unable to draw anyone else into battle against me. I am sprawled over half the world, but I have no idea what the other half of the world even looks like. No-One will give me a World map for anything :mad:.<br />
<br />
I have been producing more settlers than almost anything but MWs. I followed Rome around as he eliminated England, and more recently in the conflict between Egypt and Rome (Egypt started it and got thoroughly roasted).<br />
I just noticed that Mapstat is permissible for GOTM so now I will go and see how close I am to a domination victory :crazyeye: <br />
<br />
I have been tracking the score progress of the game for the past 500 years in a spreadsheet. The rise and fall of the scores has proven interesting. Currently I am gaining 14 points per turn, but I am only ahead of eliminated players. If Rome and Persia would start duking it out I would be thrilled. I did have a MPP with Persia, but I would have lost 90% of everything if I spit on Rome. So I spit on Russia instead. They were eliminated in short order. I did manage to make peace with Russia and get some Techs for Peace and 9g/turn. Persia eliminated them before I had to pay once!<br />
<br />
My greatest fear is that one of my furious neighbors will wage war against me, so I chose to pay 2g/turn tribute to Persia and Rome. I hope this keeps them happy ...well...annoyed... with me.<br />
Japan is thrilled with me because I accidentally gave them Gems for nothing. <br />
Maybe someday I will get something more than Pikemen to defend against the tanks that everyone else has.<br />
<br />
Something that surprised me: <br />
I have had 4 or 5 cities depose my governors, but Rome and Persia have both rebuffed the rebels :nono:  so I have retained control. <br />
I am surprised by their unwillingness to accept my wonderful, though culturally deprived, cities. Why would they not accept them? Are they afraid of a domination victory?</div></div><hr />

When for peace, but as russia was dieing I attacked them, so I could get my golden age.<br />

I am just entering the modern age.<br />
About 4 in score.  but I do'nt have  much of a chance if I'm attacked.<br />
<br />
Been trading with all the different civs so they are polite to me (except for Japan).  only problem is with the City races that went there isn't a solid line of borders, but cities all intermingled together.<br />
<br />
So far lost 1 city due to culture, got 2 cities due to culture and captured 2, and set up 5 cities in empty spaces left by the AI wars.<br />
1550AD now and I expect a UN vote here soon, or another 100 turns before somebody launches a ship.<br />
<br />
Well I'm not going to win any awards, but looks like my civ will live though a deity level game.<br />
<br />
The thing with deity level is I spend all my time try to catchup and stay alive.  on the good side I see the AI using carriers and bombers like I would, bomb the roads arround cities to cut them off from resupply and then mass armor attacks to take out the city<br />

and if hopeless, burn everything in sight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Monarch is kind of easy for me. Emperor is a tough challenge. Diety is really beyond that. The tech rate is ridiculous compared to emperor. Atleast on emperor there is enough time to build soem horsemen and kill a civ. Diety is soo fast. <br />
<br />
To add to the challenge we have a pretty crap map around us. The starting location is ok but w/o a river. Then we got tons of mountains to the south. <br />
<br />
Although I'm not good at diety I think I could have done far better score wise if playing on a better map. The map totally ruins the expansionist ability. <br />
<br />
So far have 11 cities. The AI is around Astronomy/Gunpowder techs while I'm trying to buy construction and enter Middle Ages. Last in score, duh!. So far no wars for me. I don't the AI has done any fighting either. I was hoping Persia would come and slaughter Russia or Germany because they have no iron, since I'm blocking it. I would have liked to attack Russia but I couldn't get horses quick enough.<br />
<br />
Hopefully AI will start fighting soon and I'll grab empty land and buy techs of some desperate civ. Most likely lose by diplo loss or spaceship.</div></div><hr />

While it provides some level of solace when others are in the same boat I am left wondering if this map and level was for the 10% who could even think of a win. Peninsular, Mountains, limited recources and no rivers. I hope that one day a Deity comes along in a good start position. This would allow all possible strategies a go at this Level. I am having fun but feel a peaceful expansion was impossible. Someone please correct me but with only one Diplomatic victory posted so far Deity is for a very agressive player.<br />

For mighty I was the scurge.  I got a settler out of the first hut and built another city near my capitol, then I preceded to build many a worker and a granary in the capitol.  The capitol would be the only city to build settlers, for barracks where the way all other cities must go.  I chose not to travel west to the open plains and great luxeries, but to travel east.  For east is where you will find pre-built cities, pre-built wonders, and a few luxeries.  In one sense I may have been the luckiest player.  Germany built on the Russian Iron.  I then went off to conquer, rape, pillage, but never burn.  Got a great leader outside of smolensk, and built FP in moscow.  Moscow had great library.  This brought me back up to par with learning.  Russia was not worth my time little and easily defeated in a matter of ten turns.  Further east do my MW want to go.  Germany still doesn't have access to its Iron, so destroy them I did.  Just a few more turns, one surprise in berlin.  Musketmen.  The end of my great counquest is near.  Finished off the germans, except for one city then traded for all the knowledge in the game again.  Then switched to democracy and built from within.  I had a large enough civ to keep in a dead even tech race with the AI.  No major wars till near the end.  That is when WWI started.  Rome was getting gready and came at me,  I just sent the AI at them and countinued growing, made peace with rome before 20turns, war weariness.  Nobody liked me the rest of the game.  Around ten turns before game over WWII started, I was gready.  The persians had the UN and nobody liked me.  I was the only one that could be voted for if I held the UN so I went on a great journey with seven armies of tanks and many little tank minnions.  Did not make it to the UN, but did take sun tsu's.  Made peace and went to space, very early.  You will see the date and score when the GOM scores are posted next month, untill then I can't wait for the next GOM.</div></div><hr />

I went for 2 cities closest to the capital to making settlers, and the 3rd city near the capitor to make warrior/spearmen for the settlers.<br />
Then the Settler/military unit would head off to a site already exporered by a scout.<br />
<br />
The two cities in russian area where because I found a second goodies hut with a settler in it and it made the first city and that city made a settler.<br />
<br />
all the settlers from the capital area went south. 1st one to the land bridge to block it from other civs and to set up a major port, 2 in the hills between capital and land bridge (to prevent the russians from setting up a city blocking access to the land bridge.<br />
<br />
The 2nd city was actually sent deep into the land south of the land bridge. to make 1 temple, then the forbiden palace.<br />
<br />
Also in conjuction was four workers making a road south.<br />
<br />
I ended up getting most of the southern land mass, but with my land split up into 3 major pieces, with 3 cities by themselves.<br />
<br />
Also stayed out of the wars.<br />
<br />
this allowed me to build up cities and science while the AI kept having wars.<br />
<br />
now it is 1600AD, I just made 3 tacicatal nukes, and to my surprise I just became the number 1 civ.  Bad part is japan (number 2) just decleared war out of the blue, so I asked the 2 other major AI civs to help in my war, one wanted a resource the other wanted nothing.<br />
<br />
I am still behind about 3-5 techs from the more advanced AI civs.<br />
but behind with military forces.<br />
<br />
The other way to get land is to get a ROP with a civ at war with another and then move settlers to choice spots as the two civs destory cities.<br />
<br />
Now my question is will I be able to survive a war with me not having to use nukes to destory naval forces, or to take out invasion beachheads?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your game sounds fairly similar to mine, as far as similar goes at this level.<br />
<br />
While you built the FB palace to the south I built the FB palace in the home land and moved my main palace to the far south. This gave me a second nucleus of cities with fairly low corruption and some much needed production.<br />
<br />
The Japanese were the civ that I won the UN election against (3-1), so that shows that they were right up there power wise in my game also. They seemed well positioned to play the wild card, with their island position and yet still in contact with all the other civs.<br />
<br />
Wish your luck on your end game war, I think it would have been pretty dicey for me to have survived as long as you have.<br />

I did not finish last, I think because I paid all tributes and none of the powerful other civs declared war on me. I had one small episode of war, in which I conquered two persian cities with a handfull of mounted warriors. I was luckily awarded with a GL who proceeded to build the FB. After that, it was a struggle to survive, which went reasonably well until I suffered a humiliating but expected defeat in 1410. I think the Romans won but I have no idea how. That leaves me with two questions:<br />
<br />
1. Is there a way of finding out how you lost?<br />
2. Are there people with a *working* summary replay? Mine has never worked through all versions..:cry:</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure what it depends on. It might be your computer or it might be the new save formats. Maybe on longer, more complicated games it takes longer to start because sometimes it starts right away for me. Wait 5 minutes and it will surely have started by then no matter how bad your machine or complicated the replay.</div></div><hr />

Well of course you can reject demands if you're already the world leader..... My comments were directed towards the majority of players who were at the bottom of the barrel like me. I went back after I finished to some autosaves and tried rejecting a few demands and kicking soldiers out of my territory. Every single time the other nations declared war on me. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

It is entirely possible that Persia or Germany softened up Russia for him...especially since he was also able to take out Germany.<br />

Or if we wish to hate him for his success we could just accuse him of reloading.<br />

<br />
Democracy would not have been possible in 100 AD in my game but it was shortly after ~ say 300 AD so i dont think its out of the realm of possibilty. I think research was abit slower in my game. It depends a lot on how fast the other civs made contact. Likewise Russia and Germany were defeated by about 300 AD and again i could see it be being done sooner.  <br />
<br />
In fact an earlier attack would likely have been over more swiftly. SO i wouldn't say it wasnt doable.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you can share HOW you did that - what year did you build your first mounted warrior? Where did you drop your first city? Because the Russians get horsman VERY early - I'd say arround 2000 BC. What unit were you sending over them hills to beat the Russians? Surely not a swordsman. I sincerely doubt a mounted warrior.

First, calm down before you hurt yourself! ;) It was actually possible to get to the horses first and use them against Russia; I didn't do it, but multiple others have posted stories and pictures showing that it was possible. <br />
<br />
I'm in the process of writing up the full story of my game, which I hope to have online on Friday. I played a peaceful game all the way, and didn't fight my first war until 950AD, when everyone was already in the modern era except me.

There are potentially 26 grass squares on the peninsula. Far more than needed for 4 cities. In addition you have 2 fish squares that can be utilized. Even using only one worker (unlikely)you could hook up the horses in 40 turns roughly. And all you needed to claim the iron once you found it was a settler and harbour. It was a difficult start yes, but I think some of your comments are a bit over the top.:egypt:</div></div><hr />

That is exactly the proper analysis. Food is the limiting factor in this position. In 3850bc, Niagara Falls had three grassland squares to develop, while Salamanca had four. Later, the forests were cleared and irrigated. The scout pushes south. <br />

Not 50/50. A quick look at the starting map makes this clear. Also, I am building a second scout in Salamanca. :king: <br />

I recently replayed my game using SirPleb's strategy. Even though I got a bonus settler this time, :D , I couldn't crush the Russians until 10 AD. My time of &quot;Charge!&quot; went earlier, but it was still 510 BC when my 9 MWs were in front of Russian door.<br />
<br />
SirPleb's 690 BC assault was really impressive, and I fully believe if I charged that early I would have destroyed the Germans by the end of BCs.<br />

I agree with your analysis. Fortunately, the Iroquois are expansionist. I built two scouts and this is what happened. Notice I still haven't headed north, but will let a warrior do that as it will probably deadend in tundra and ice mountains. Well, I was half right. <br />
<br />
http://www.crowncity.net/civ3/gotm7/bc3650.jpg <br />

The scouts will split up, one heading east and one west. I found the chokepoint in 3300bc and met the Russians in 3150bc.</div></div><hr />

Hi Elfi,<br />
<br />
Your game sounds fairly similar to mine, as far as similar goes at this level.<br />
<br />
Wish your luck on your end game war, I think it would have been pretty dicey for me to have survived as long as you have.<br />
<br />
CB <br />
<br />
I did well with the japanese, they are far away on an island so my little navy was able to stop them and with 3 transports landing on a island I got 2 of their Cities before I asked for peace.<br />
<br />
<br />
now it is  1770<br />
<br />
And the Persian just declared war.  First invasion is 80+ units.  my whole army is only about 100 units. <br />
So I have no choice but to order a nuclear :nuke: strike against the invasion force.<br />
<br />
I expect a world war and the death :skull: of most of my Civilization.<br />
:mutant:<br />
<br />
to bad the scores are : <br />
Iroquois 3227<br />
Rome 2759<br />
Japan 2646<br />
England 2561<br />
Persia 2473<br />
Egypt 2361<br />
Russia 1070 dead<br />
Germany 422 dead<br />
<br />
PS. I have never used a nuclear weapon in Civ3 so now I get to find out how much they have changed from Civ2.<br />
<br />
PPS. is there an award for the most radaited planet?  from spys I guess there is about 100 nukes between everyone.<br />

<br />
about 50-70% of military units die.<br />
The Footprint looses all improvements, becomes worse terran, and are poluted (grassland to plains, plains to desert).<br />
Cities are reduced 50%.<br />
<br />
The civ affected, (by land, or unit hurt) will then use nuclear weapons, even again a nation that didn't use nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
All non-aliagn Civs declare war. (so if you are planning to use nukes, get all non-align civs to be in an alliance vs the civ you are going to attack.<br />

<br />
Use 2 nukes in the first turn of the invasion. 1st nukes is against the major invasion force (over 80 units, + 2 armys), the second is against the remains of one of my cities (persians captured and razed the city).  Estimated dead, 60 Persian military units.<br />
Next turn Persia Launches all ICBMS and several tactical nukes, 5 Iroquois cities get hit, and 1 Roman city.<br />
<br />
Over the next 2 turns Persian cities get Nukes from several Civs.<br />
At least 9 cities are Nuked.<br />
Several Naval concentrations are also nuked (tactical nukes from subs)<br />
<br />
So far I have counted about 25 Nuclear strikes arround the world.<br />
The nuclear strikes on cities are devasting, with large numbers of workers need just to rebuild 1 cities over 20 turns.<br />

<br />
I put salamanca down on the starting point, built a couple of scouts and a granary then just went warrior / settler / warrior ad-infinitum (well, for around 10 sets anyway).  As soon as I had around 6 cities (one built on horses), I built a road, switched to barracks and started building mws in all cities.<br />
<br />
I brought two scouts back to &quot;watch&quot; the russians.  They hadn't developed the iron (even though it was right next to a city), so I attacked.  The first move was to use a scout to pillage their horses.<br />
<br />
Partway through my campaign, they did develop the iron, but NEVER restored the roads to the horses.  Hence, I had to deal with about 3 pikemen (max), and the rest were archers and spearmen and only around 3 horsemen.<br />
<br />
Can't remember what year it was, but it was only around 100 ad at worst - the AI developed fuedelism half-way through my campaing (didn't help Catherine though! :D )<br />

Still don't belive my end score. 4949.<br />
<br />
I think I won because I got 2 settlers from the first 2 goodies hut.<br />
<br />
then 2 tech that no one had and I did a big trading early on and trade the 2 techs + money for more tech and just keep trading with everyone, about 20-10 turns before I made the Great Library.  All the trading made the civs like me better.<br />

Even if you have only 2 gold, some AI will demand that from you, so I spent most of the game at 0 gold.<br />
<br />
My settler freely explored most of the Russian, German, Persian, and Egyptian territories.  They ask you to leave, but you usually can spend hundreds of years in there territory before being forced to leave (just don't keep popping in and out of their territory).  Since they eliminated the exploit of where you could plant forests in AI territory (to starve them), I was irrigating Russia's mines and mining their irrigation! :lol: <br />
<br />
After awhile I got bored with moving my units around (and my map wasn't worth selling anymore), so I just fortified them wherever they where.  Eventually my settler that was down by Egypt got forced to move out and ended up on the other side of the world by Rome.  My barbaric Iroquios people were dumbfounded to see Roman bombers and English battleships.<br />
<br />
Without a city, you get no notification of wars so I had to guess who was at war by watching the cities exchange hands.  Of course you get no notification of when someone declares war on you, until you've lost your scout or worker.<br />
<br />
1730 A.D. Egypt killed my worker.  Got peace several turns later for free (because I had nothing to give!).  1796 A.D. Persia kills my scout.  Got peace for free with them too.  But they signed a trade embargo with Japan against me (how can I even trade????).  Shorty after signing peace with Persia, Japan lands 2 infantry and 2 cavalry right next to my settler, so I knew it was over (my settler was trapped on a peninsula, so it couldn't try running).  Rome was polite to me during the Egyptian war, so Rome and Egypt must have been at war.<br />
<br />
I out-survived Russia and Germany, who were both taken out by Persia in 1250 and 1380 A.D., respectively.  Persia was on the way to domination when I lost, they were in the process of conquering Egypt.  Funny thing is, the AI entered the modern era around 1300 A.D., yet no one had finished the spaceship when I got killed at 1814 A.D.  I finished, with of course, 0 points. Persia had 4500+.</div></div><hr />

If the barbarian difficulty level had been set to 'Raging', alot of people would have been in deep trouble.  I wouldn't worry about enemy civs, because if they send any units at all, it will be more than just 1 warrior can defend against so the game would be lost anyways (on deity, the AI starts with 12 free military units, so would likely send at least 3 warriors at you).<br />

Actually, the key to do early atack in this time is STICK to the initial peninsula. Build 5-8 cities then keep producing MWs then GO!<br />
<br />
If you waste time in making settlers to the other peninsula you will never be in the position to attack, IMHO.<br />
I think this is an important point - on this map, and generally at Deity level, you can't pursue two build strategies at the same time early in the game. If you're going to go military then after building your capital region as quickly as possible, it is important to devote all production to military buildup. If you split the production to work on two strategies your military strength won't be high enough.<br />
<br />
There are twists to this because of what sometimes helps toward military buildup. I hurried some early temples because that would allow me to capture cities in my assault instead of razing and replacing - the investment in temples was done to avoid needing a higher investment in settlers during the assault.<br />
Edit: That particular tradeoff is especially attractive when playing a religious Civ as in this GOTM because temples cost only 30 shields.</div></div><hr />

A quick question on the initial build sequence for Salamanca. For all the people who did Scout, Granary, Settler, how do you know that barbs will not appear in the early game, or how would you deal with them if they popped up?<br />
<br />
I don't worry much about defending against very early barbarian attacks. If they happen, they happen. I figure I'll lose less by letting them hit me a bit than by losing expansion time. If I see them coming I'll try to rush or change production in the town they'll visit to minimize the losses. This thinking applies more at Deity level than at others - the barbarians are much stronger at Deity, to the point where a single warrior is not a good match for them. An early minimal defense isn't a good bet at Deity level, not against an early aggressive rival or against barbarians. So I usually don't build any at the start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. Even on Deity and Raging, I am rarely subject to attack for several turns in any case, so I nearly always build a scout first. Once you know the strategic situation by exploration, you are in a much better position as far as expansion or aggression. <br />
<br />
By the way, good play SirPleb, and a &quot;game worthy&quot; method of dense build, i.e. geared to the position and the terrain. As I have posted before, on higher levels, you generally want a little denser build. With this position, and so little arable land, having a couple of extra cities early is a good idea. <br />
<br />
I went with a standard build, for the challenge. I attacked the Russians in about 170bc, and built the Forbidden Palace in Kiev. I was  caught up technologically in the Industrial Age. I owe everything to my able diplomats for keeping me out of trouble at crucial moments in the game.</div></div><hr />

SirPleb, good point! I fell for building warriors early. (had 4 warriors and 4 scouts at one point). One thing about deity is you have to learn to drop all the bad habits. Only a few hundred more bad habits to drop.<br />

That sounds like Civ II talk!<br />
<br />
The first time I was involved in any war was when I attacked first.  That doesn't completely answer your question though.  <br />
<br />
I'm no expert, but generally I find that the AI will start demanding stuff rather than just attacking.  When they start the demands, it may be a bluff, but it may be an indication that they think they are ahead of you military-wise.  I usually use that as a cue to really start building my military, if I haven't done so already.  Hopefully I've already built some for a pre-emptive strike though :D.</div></div><hr />

But, if on the power graph your civ is more powerful, you can likely decline paying the gift and get away with it. If your civ is strong militarily and on the power chart, you can likely make some demands yourself. ;)<br />

It depends very much on the map and the situation. I don't build many until I have some idea what I'll be using them for. On this map it became clear fairly early that there weren't barbarians, and that the nearest rivals had to travel a fair distance if they attacked. So I never did build much of a defense. I did give in to all early extortion demands :)</div></div><hr />

Deity. What a killer. My usual games are at Regent level.  I managed to get to the horses and build some MW. My first war was a disaster. I successfully took one of the Russian towns but their counter attack took out my horse resource town. End of game. :(.<br />
<br />
However, I then trolled through this thread like a parched sponge and have learnt tons more about this game. Especially thanks to SirPleb. You rock! :)<br />
<br />
I've since had 2 more goes at the map (not for submission of course, just for my own learning) and have discovered the joys of expansionist early trading. By sending one scout east and one west I was able to be the middle man on a lot of trading and was able to keep up with the AI up to feudalism at least.<br />

I agree with your analysis. Fortunately, the Iroquois are expansionist. I built two scouts and this is what happened. Notice I still haven't headed north, but will let a warrior do that as it will probably deadend in tundra and ice mountains. Well, I was half right. <br />
<br />
http://www.crowncity.net/civ3/gotm7/bc3650.jpg <br />
<br />
The scouts will split up, one heading east and one west. I found the chokepoint in 3300bc and met the Russians in 3150bc. <br />
<br />
I made the mistake of having them explore south, thinking there might be room. I saw the bottleneck, but the Russians were hot on my tail...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nbarclay</div><div class="date">May 19, 2002, 07:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tried quite a few Deity-level starts, but never even came close to playing a game through before now.  It actually went better than I was afraid it would, especially after seeing how small the initial green area was, but I still lost.  Two critical mistakes took away whatever chances I might have had.<br />
<br />
(1) I got careless with my only galley and forgot I needed to watch and make sure I ended on a coast tile.  It sank, and with it a settler, a warrior, and my chance to grab some silk or build any more cities across the bay.  (I already had two cities right across from my home area, but they weren't geared for rapid growth and settler production the way Niagra Falls and especially Salamenca were.)<br />
<br />
(2) Thanks to tight city packing at home (six cities north of the mountains), I was able to engage in a successful war against Russia from 70-170 AD.  I made peace a bit short of taking Moscow, with plans to go back and finish the Russian core off later.  But while waiting for the peace treaty to expire, I was crazy enough to think a quick smash-and-grab against Persia might be a good idea.  HUGE mistake.  I ended up wasting a good chunk of my golden age and most of my military in a hopeless fight trying to fend off cavalry and riflemen with mounted warriors, and only got out alive by bribing Egypt into an alliance and then promptly abandoning my allies.  I lost about half of my gains from the attack on Russia, and the loss of most of my firepower made a mess out of my plans to hit Russia again when the initial peace treaty expired.  (At least I did still have the gem city I founded to replace a Russian one that didn't survive capture.)<br />
<br />
After that point, I was just waiting for one of the AIs to finish me off, trying to run up as high a score as I could in the territory I had along the way.  But they didn't finish me off, and by the end of the game, my nation was actually first in GNP and Manufactured Goods.  (Along the way, I'd founded one city on unclaimed land along the Russian-Persian-Iroquois border, had one of the cities Persia took from me after I took it from Russia flip to me, and founded three other cities in razed territory north of Rome.)<br />
<br />
Japan finally launched its spaceship in 1630 AD, just as I finished the Apollo Program.  (Coincidence, or not?  I got the message that I'd lost between the time the game handled the between-turns stuff like giving build orders when a city finishes building something and the time my turn started, so there SHOULDN'T have been time for Japan to see that I'd finished Apollo and decide they needed to go ahead and launch.  But given how long Japan had had the key technologies - I'd expected the space race to be over much sooner - I can't help but wonder.)<br />
<br />
In any case, my score of just under 2000 isn't bad for a loss.  And, perhaps more importantly, it's given me enough confidence that I'll probably try some more experimenting on Deity instead of giving up in frustration at how far behind human players pretty much inevitably seem to fall on that level in the early game.<br />

I thought I could just mop up the Japanese and get on with milking but they managed to get 4 techs ahead of me. I figured I would just go over there and raze all those big cities and get a bunch of workers. Actually I had to build a bunch of one-way transports after researching combustion because they had this huge fleet of ironclads and battleships. Then I had to pound away with 10 artillery until the cities were shattered and very little was left. I got tanks a while after I was done finishing them off. I had 10 armies of cavalry but they were always sitting around healing. On the plus side I got those 4 techs + free artistry later off the Japanese which saved a fair amount of research. I spied on their cities and they had 80% entertainers because they were a democracy at war for a long time before I forced them to declare on me, but yet the cities weren't shrinking and they managed to put out substantial amounts of military.<br />
<br />
I went back and beat down the English and the Romans who had been warring each other for a while because they were messing up my empire. Now the English are stuck in the north and the Romans have a single land locked city.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirPleb</div><div class="date">May 20, 2002, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've finished my game:<br />
<br />
At the end of my previous post I had taken out much of Russia (with Mounted Warriors), most of Germany (with combined MW+Knights), and had just launched a Cavalry assault on Persia. Rome was very strong in the west but was blocked from coming east by a city on the south-central bottleneck.<br />
<br />
The world had just entered the Industrial Age at this time. The research rate of the other Civs had slowed (partly because Russia, Germany, and Persia no longer had much research capacity, partly because research now required a larger effort.) I joined the research race, intending to learn new technology from this point onward as well as getting some from the other Civs. My Cavalry were no longer very strong. I had only about 20 left and Riflemen were now appearing as defenders.<br />
<br />
I took a couple more Persian cities. As soon as my MPPs with Egypt and Japan lapsed I gave Persia peace. I flipped to Democracy and began a builder phase. It was time to build railroads!<br />
<br />
I learned Scientific Method before the other Civs and rushed Theory Of Evolution with the leader I'd saved. This gave me my first significant lead in technology. I began trading technology while continuing to build and to research. Only Rome and Japan were useful trading partners - all other rivals were too weak at this point to keep up. I built Hoover Dam.<br />
<br />
Japan declared war on me during my builder phase. I gave up an island town and took one of her two mainland towns with my remaining Cavalry. Aside from those events this war was uneventful and Japan soon agreed to peace.<br />
<br />
As soon as I learned Motorized Transportation I began building tanks. I slowed research to a crawl and focused on hurrying tanks and factories. I wanted to attack Rome before she could also build tanks. As soon as I had about 25 tanks I took MPPs with Japan, Egypt, and England, and then launched an assault on Rome.<br />
<br />
I captured the chokepoint at the NE of Rome's homeland then spent many turns defending it. Rome had a huge military and sent some large stacks of Infantry, Riflemen, and assorted weaker units to try to recapture the chokepoint. During this extended battle I got three Great Leaders. I used them (and almost all subsequent leaders) for armies. Tank armies are a great way to attack large cities defended by Infantry! During this phase I began researching again. I also switched back to Monarchy when war weariness became substantial.<br />
<br />
After finally destroying Rome's huge assault stacks I began the invasion of Rome. This was uneventful. Our culture had grown enormously during the builder phase so I captured cities instead of razing them. There was one culture flip back to Rome but it was easily recaptured. I continued the assault until Rome was entirely destroyed. Near the end of this phase I built the UN.<br />
<br />
Next I took all remaining Persian cities, then all remaining English cities. These were easy, neither had any real strength.<br />
<br />
Next I landed an invasion force in Japan, razed and replaced a few cities, then rushed an airport and played defensively in that region until Japan agreed to peace.<br />
<br />
Egypt was next. It took a long time to take the majority of Egypt due to the mountainous territory. But the outcome was never in doubt.<br />
<br />
After giving Egypt peace I gifted Japan a town surrounded with Mechanized Infantry in the mountainous ex-Egyptian territory. I then launched a new attack on Japan.<br />
<br />
I mopped up the remaining opposition. I razed cities in Japan's case instead of capturing because I would be leaving Japan in the game with one city during the milking phase.<br />
<br />
Finally a milking phase. This went fairly quickly because I'd been splitting effort between war and ongoing builder activity for a long time during the final wars. I could have finished off the opposition a fair bit earlier if I hadn't overlapped the beginning of the milking phase with the wars. This overlap made things more interesting though, and I think it improved score a bit.<br />
<br />
This map has a lot of coastal tiles! So the domination threshold looks as if it is very high - it is possible to take a very large percentage of the actual land without triggering domination.<br />
<br />
I ended up with a pretty good score I think. Sure was a challenging and fun game!</div></div><hr />

Other than that, I've only read Zachriel's game so far - I haven't read anyone else's post here cause I'm not finished my game yet.<br />
<br />
I'm in 320 AD &amp; things are going pretty bad.  I will likely not win this one so finishing is quite unlikely.  It is my first Deity game ever &amp; needless to say, the starting position was not helpful.<br />
<br />
My 3 or 4 scouts did pretty good mapping out the west &amp; gained maybe 3 or 4 techs (both the wheel &amp; horseback riding real quick!).  Then, of course, I had to scramble to get the horse, which I was able to do eventually.  Shortly after hooking it up, Russia declared war on me &amp; because one of their towns was in between my horse &amp; capital, my trade was severed.  Having mainly just built military units thus far, I had enough to raze their town to restore my road route, but because of some sort of bug, the horses were shown as &quot;unconnected&quot; for 3 turns before they were magically connected again.  This put me off for the match &amp; I don't think I mentally recovered from it.<br />
<br />
I made a bad move switching to Monarchy during the Russia war, because my unit support was cut in half &amp; I was paying over 20/turn for units!  I disbanded my explorers &amp; sold my granaries until later I just moved back to Desp, which is what I am in now, to pay for my army.<br />
<br />
Short wars were my style up to now, taking 1 or 2 cities and then settling for peace for a handful of tech.  I am currently researching Chemistry at 10% while the AI is past Nationalism.  I had extended myself down to the gems but never could get past the AIs' superior units very much to really take out any more.<br />
<br />
I have iron in the land just west of the capital, but no harbour there yet - I'm working on it.  Of course, I have no saltpeter either.  My poor spearmen :(.  I might get Nationalism before I get iron or saltpeter!  Without iron though, my MWs just don't cut through fortified riflemen too well and my spearmen aren't much against cavalry.  It is the first game I have the next resource before I hook up the previous one to use!<br />
<br />
Since I am resource &amp; tech challenged, I don't think I can do much - hence, continuing is in doubt, unless I just go for some survival strategy, which I may to play out the game, but I see little point.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I learned:<br />
- I should have used a military alliance or 2 to get the AIs to help me take out targetted civs.  Russia kept barely overpowering me.  1 helper would have probably licked them for me.<br />
<br />
- Watch the unit support before switching govts.  I was lucky we were Religious this time!<br />
<br />
- Taken a better look at hooking up iron earlier.  My focus was somewhere else, I guess.<br />
<br />
Good luck, and cry the name of your fallen comrade, &quot;chiefpaco&quot;, when your warriors go to battle!  Avenge my shameful attempt at a conquest!</div></div><hr />

My capital started with the classic scout, warrior, granary and my newly formed second city was targeted to be military production center.  I quickly produced a number of scouts and sent them out exploring.  My first two settlers were sent out to grab the horses and gems that my scouts had discovered.  A conscript warrior that I had popped from a hut was sent to hold the choke point.  <br />
<br />
Discovered the Russians and managed to trade for some techs.  I quickly discovered the English, Romans and Germans and managed to buy/trade a number of ancient techs.  My scouts continued to explore the world, and I sold my world map to whoever wanted to buy it.  During this exploration period, numerous civs came to me with demands that I could not refuse :mad: (give us tribute or we wipe you from the face of the earth), being smart I did not refuse (on deity, payback usually comes later ).  During this time I revealed a large portion of the map and determined that I would like to settle the large area of land to the south, it had resources and luxuries  :D .  I sent a number of  settler/spearmen combos down south to try and grab as much of that land as I possible.  After grabbing as much of that land as possible I put my next plan into effect.<br />
<br />
First portion of the plan, was to start building the FP next to my capital, the second step was to prep a city down south to get the Palace when I abandoned my original capital.  The third step was to start a war with the English who had an outpost city on one of the silk cites  just to the west of the choke point.  Well I managed to accomplish my goal, win a battle, trigger a golden age, finish the FP and then relocate the palace.  It worked like a charm.  I made peace with the English for a few techs and proceeded to live a peaceful existence until I discovered motorized transport. With this discovery, I started to build tanks, lots of tanks :tank: ^10, to go along with the infantry and artillery that I had been stockpiling.  Hey boys and girls, what time it is?  &quot;It's payback time&quot; (see note above) and the Russians were the first to suffer my wrath.  The Russians were followed by the Persians, Egyptians and then the English (Germans, Romans, and Japanese had already been taken out by the AI).  <br />
<br />
In conclusion, &quot;He who demands a territory map and 17 gp last, laughs loudest&quot;  :lol:</div></div><hr />

The English launched a few randomly targeted, IMHO, at me, I launched two, strategically placed and managed to take out their capital in one turn, without having to abuse a ROP.   :nuke:</div></div><hr />

Better than me, over 40, I think about 50-55 warheads where detonated. First time I ever saw Nuclear weapons used in civ 3.</div></div><hr />

Brilliant.  Spotting &amp; settling open land.  Amazing how opportunistic one can be &amp; how well it can pay off.</div></div><hr />

Everybody should have got the first settler, at least.</div></div><hr />

Include me in the list of winning with no starting bonus settlers!:D</div></div><hr />

Not I.<br />
I just experienced Death by Spaceship in 1600, and in my replay everyone else had four or five cities before I had my second.</div></div><hr />

I just replayed the start, and didn't get a settler. They didn't save the RNG seed! <br />
