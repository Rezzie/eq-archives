<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">knowltok2</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What lessons did you learn from this game?<br />
<br />
Mine:<br />
<br />
1.  Don't ignore the ocean even if you are a land power.<br />
<br />
2.  On raging barbarians, more actively kill off the encampments.<br />
<br />
3.  Declaring war in a democracy is a really tricky thing.  They tell you to be careful, you try to be careful, and then that damn b**** in the Armee shirt takes back one of the cities you conquered from her.<br />
<br />
4.  MPP can be a problem for a democracy if you can't get to one of the people you are at war with.  France had a big army and scared me, so I MPP'ed them to catch up.  Meanwhile they kept getting into wars with Japan across the ocean.  I was dragged in and couldn't do enough damage to get peace soon enough.  (See point 1)<br />
<br />
5.  Jungles suck!  I knew this already, but the point was driven home quite well.<br />
<br />
6.  Artillery make a good counter to enemy navy units.  Especially when you are railroaded.<br />
<br />
7.  Trading for world maps even when you know you will not uncover anything new still reveals the locations of barbarian encampments.<br />
<br />
Well, those are a few of the things I learned.  I am winning my game, in the process of eliminating the French, have the UN, and am ahead in the tech race with three SS parts built.  I will likely win through SS if I don't run out of time (real life time, there is plenty of game time left).<br />
<br />
Comments, suggestions, lessons you've learned......?</div></div><hr />

Well, If I'd invested in Chivalry, I would have conquered England 500 years earlier, built a Forbidden Palace in a better location and finished the game earlier not relying on those magnificent panzers :-) that much.</div></div><hr />

As surprising as this might be, I now feel better about the whole thing.  (Imagination is a dangerous thing.  ;)  )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creepster</div><div class="date">Jun 27, 2002, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The most interesting thing I learned this game is that if you want a high score you have to settle all of the territory you can as early as you can in the game.  This will help to get your score up as soon as possible.  I never realized the full impact of this on your score until now.  <br />
<br />
Lesson # 2 It is almost a waste to optimize placing cities in the game.  While they look pretty and can really produce you really don't get much out of it.  It is easier to dense build and keep the cities under 12 (no hospitals required), and only have five or six power houses for large scale production items.</div></div><hr />
