I´m new to this forum, but I´ve played civ2 online for a good time now. I also have done scenariomaking, mostly modern ones. But as I´m interested very much in World War two, I want to make a scenario about it. Not the whole war, there are already too many very good scenarios out there. But I thougth of a scenario about one campaign/operation. Just give me your suggestions. I would also appreciate help later on, as I´m not very good in editing events...Just post your suggestions!!!<br />

<br />
The second world war in China should also be interesting. An other nice theater of war might be North Africa.</div></div><hr />

I think there hasn´t been a scenario about battan or fall gelb/blau yet, but there is a real good one about afrika. What about &quot;Weserübung&quot;? Should be interesting, too...<br />

I thought I remembered some forum traffic on it.  If not, then I'd vote for that.
