<br />
Here's a place you can talk about what you are seeing in your Antarctica games...I've released the v1.0 finally and for those of you who have play tested you may want to check it out again and see if you can recognize any changes (I'm sure you will). <br />
<br />
It's a bit harder than before and there are a few graphics I've improved. <br />
<br />
Let me know what you think.<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
John</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was just in the Chat and one player was telling me they could not get the scenario to work...I asked what version of Civ was being used and he said ToT...ToT to my knowledge cannot use scenarios at this site unless they are specifically designated ToT. <br />
<br />
I guess I should state that ToT is not really a same Civ2 group that can play most scenarios...even if you have FW, you can still play MGE scenarios with a converter (although I have found that some MGE scenarios will have a protocol error that crashes the game).<br />

John the scenario is great! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif Have you been nominated to the SHOF? If not i nominate you!<br />
