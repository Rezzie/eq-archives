<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Jul 21, 2002, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I vote windows. I never used mac except for back in school and they were quite possibly the dumbest machines I have ever worked with. Of course, I didn't mind it as much since they used a security program called MacControl to block us from stuff and I knew how to disable the extension(change passwords/have complete access) so I would change the privelages of the guest account(that was never used) to have full access. Then we got windows, the machines we had were faster(by farrrrrrr.....) than any Mac at the time. The security was also better. Not to mention we had to install civ 2 for mac to play it and you can play it off CD in windows :)</div></div><hr />

That's really what i meant. I had one of the newer ones before i got this thing. it never crashed, but then again i only had like 4 games for it (civ 1 included!) because you could never find any for it. Oh well, i voted mac anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Gaming - Win<br />
2. Networking - Linux for enterprise, Win for local.<br />
3. Graphic Arts / Audio editing / Video editing - Mac<br />
4. Originality - Mac<br />
4. Popularity (the more people that use it, the more programs there will be for it, bla bla bla) - Win<br />
<br />
I'd love to have a G4.  But at the same time, because Evil Microsoft is still on top, I have to have a system running Win to play my games.  Now if we can get Lindows to deliver on any of they're promises we'd be in good shape.</div></div><hr />

Spamming is a no-no. If you want to bump your thread you can make 1 educated post as a bumper post even if it isn't too relevant. Posting letters repeatedly is a no no. I'm deleting the other posts.<br />

<br />
When I had a Mac, I never saw it crash once for the five years I had it. It was a great computer, just there were never as many games for it as there were PC's, so i was forced to switch to Windows (God help me, I said the w-word!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">philippe</div><div class="date">Aug 24, 2002, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i used macs in my camp and well...they really really really SUCK!<br />
Im sorry to say this but macs are the worst computers ever.It crashes even more then WINDOWS ME!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Aug 25, 2002, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe! Good to see ya around again phillipe. Of course, we cannot generalize macs as they aren't all the same. The frequency of lockups on macs for me has been high but that might've just been the software I had installed. Who knows. <br />
<br />
But come on, more that win ME!?!?!?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zwelgje</div><div class="date">Aug 26, 2002, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't like macs either, I use them on my work with complicated software and they crash quite often, if the software would have been written for PCs as well they might crash often too, I don't know about that.<br />
I'm completely used to working with PCs and having to switch to a Mac is quite a pain IMO.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanaz</div><div class="date">Aug 26, 2002, 12:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Classic mac is a pretty poor OS.  OS X is a little better, but they hacked apart the Unix to make it work.  Sure they run a little faster (less interoperability baggage), but the result is, errr, less interoperability.<br />
<br />
I'm no fan of Windows and massive code bloat, but it generally gets the job done if you throw enough HW at it and keep your system clean.  I know very few people who use Linux and Linux only - they always have a Windows box sitting around for certain things.<br />
<br />
So, as was said before, a short poll won't answer this question once and for all - it all depends on who uses it, and what for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perfection</div><div class="date">Aug 27, 2002, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I do that,  I have 3 windows and three linux ones<br />
<br />
I do like win 98.  But its crud compared to linux</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bvd</div><div class="date">Aug 27, 2002, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Up to Windows OSR-2, I'd say that the Wintel chassis is twelve times better. Now Internet Explorer (a bloated waste) is mandatory only because it is required for the &quot;Internet Connection Wizard,&quot; Windows Update, the really annoying &quot;enhanced&quot; shell (which causes resource leaks and overall slows down system performance,) the stupid hyperhelp interface/CD-Rom tour, some arcane feature in Outlook, hyperlink support in Word and (for many installation programs) those inane animated characters - all of which I'd be better off without. And that is just Windows 98! Now MS is using its consolidated software to advertise its MSN and Passport service trash, and tethering its flagship OS - a rehashed version of Windows NT - to the existence of MS with onerous &quot;activation&quot; horseshi t. And this isn't combating piracy and cutting costs - price-fixing (PC models) is a common practice within MS, as the DOJ has learned.<br />
<br />
Windows XP is one dumbed-down OS. It's emulating the worst elements of the Macintrash desktop.<br />
<br />
But I also hate Steve Jobs and would never work for one of his companies (crApple or XTreme,) and dittoheaded Mac advocates. I also hate P4 systems, and Voodoo video cards, and a plethora of other computing stuff. Then again, there is little nowadays that I don't hate ;)<br />

I needed just a few good minutes to rant; I hope you enjoyed this. ;)</div></div><hr />
