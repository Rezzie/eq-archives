<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2003, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The build queue in Barbaria includes barracks and cavalry for capturing Berlin. It is possible that the cavalry will not be needed if we manage to recruit NONE units from the barbs near Berlin. Following this Berlin Barbfarm is to build lots of engineers so we can quickly colonize all of Barbaria.<br />
<br />
Woodstock's build queue includes a destroyer in Superstorms. This is useful for sinking any Greek ships that might try reaching us. It will also be possible to use the destroyer for bombing Greek cities (Athens is a tempting target).<br />
<br />
RB means the item in question should be rushed as cash permits.<br />
<br />
If you do not vote for a particular build queue please indicate what you want changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Barbfarm: I agree with the queue, but wait until we've put down the horde.  Maybe only rush build the barracks right away, and let the others at least temporarily progress normally until it's safe.<br />
<br />
And how about alpine troops, not musketeers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2003, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oops, &quot;musketeer&quot; in the poll should have been &quot;riflemen&quot; (a copy-paste error ;)). Alpine troops make sense in some cities, they are more expensive but we are rich and can afford them.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The poll has now been fixed.</div></div><hr />
