I'm a complete history buff, so I would enjoy a historically-based scenario or map.  Let me know if there is still any interest, or if there are any openings.<br />

You're not going to get anywhere with Civ Classic. Suggest you upgrade your Civ to FW (to play scenarios) or even MGE (multi-player) by going HERE<br />

remember to play kobayashi's scenarios after that.</div></div><hr />

Guess it's time to upgrade, huh?<br />

(Though, I think I was able to run a Civ 2.72 game on my 2.42 game).</div></div><hr />
