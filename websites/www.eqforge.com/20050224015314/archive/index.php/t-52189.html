<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 01, 2003, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a poll of what to build next in those cities that are about to finish what they are producing (they'll finish it in roughly 5 turns or less regardless of whether we IPRB stuff).<br />
<br />
I've included what I think makes most sense but feel free to suggest something else. In particular what the military advisor wants in the eastern cities is important - our defenses are thinner than parchment there.<br />
<br />
I think we should build a diplomat next in LP. It can then board a trireme in the future. If we build a trireme in LP it can start exploring a little to the north and then fetch the dip once the dip is ready.<br />
<br />
I think we need to strengthen our defenses in the east. For that a diplomat in Ipec would be very useful for bribing possible enemies.<br />
<br />
I didn't include RF in the poll. I think it's pretty obvious it should build a caravan next since it's already supporting a settler.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blissful_Zen</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ipec should finish the settler, and build a DIP, very important to the defense of our eastern cities.  Naervana should then build an offensive unit. This will give us similar defense in and around all cities.  Except for the fact that movement is rough in the east. Ipec settler maybe should build a road on its way out to our fish/gold  city. <br />
<br />
I voted settler in PB, caravan in EF, but if we are trying to get 2 wonders (HG, COL)  in Dou, maybe we should build the other way around, so that the van is in PB and closer to Dou.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 09:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The warrior would be ready in 4 turns after the carvan is built, unless hurried, and HG will be complete in 3 turns. Do you think we should build it anyway, or rush it?</div></div><hr />
