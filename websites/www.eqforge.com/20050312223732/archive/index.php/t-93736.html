The one time I watched it while that Jennings man was on I got the final question and he didn't.  Pish posh, I say to him.<br />
I wonder if he's related to Peter Jennings of ABC news...</div></div><hr />

But at the same time, it did occur to me that Jeopardy must be benefiitting from the publicity.  The guy's competitors probably do not appreciate it, though... :mischief:</div></div><hr />

If you don't, I will.  :)</div></div><hr />

Oh well, although I could have used some money...</div></div><hr />

Jeopardy contestant... very bright.</div></div><hr />

So, you assume mr. Stapel knows what a jeopardy contestant is?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a game show for people with a commanding knowledge of trivia. Unlike most game shows, you have to be brilliant to win.</div></div><hr />

my guess would be that he has a list before the show of all the answers (well, questions) that will be on the show.<br />
i dont think he's got a panel of geniouses telling him the answers by earpeace even though that's what i thought at first.<br />
<br />
sometimes he gets things wrong, but i bet if you pay attention, the answer he gives (that's wrong) is the answer for one of the other questions.<br />
<br />
he just guesses correctly too often.  that's why i think he's cheating.</div></div><hr />

Hmmmm   &quot;just guessing correctly too often&quot; is how I did well on the SATs...  <br />
 :lol:</div></div><hr />

Then don't claim he's cheating.  We study for years and we learn what to guess if we don't know.  How to increase our odds of getting a guess right.  He writes the questions I get get asked at competitions so please don't say he is cheating. Jeopardy is just Quiz Team with more money involved.  From $500 to Jeopardy!'s $52,000.</div></div><hr />

The Jeopardy! team gives each contestant a list of possible topics before the show.  Ken is probably just very good at studying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RoddyVR</div><div class="date">Jul 13, 2004, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@azadre.  no, i have never participated in anything similar.  my mind doesnt work the right way for trivia.  after a bit of internet research, i found what you meant by Ken Jennings writing questions for Quiz Team (having first researched what Quiz Team is).<br />
this only makes me suspect that he's cheating even more.<br />
he's basicaly a high up insider in the quiz show/contest/trivia world.  i bet he's got some connection to some of the quiz makers on Jeopardy.<br />
<br />
before now, all i knew was that his profesion was some sort of computer related stuff, so i figured he's probably got an online friendship with one of the show's insiders.<br />
but your information makes my assumption MORE likely as far as i'm concerned.<br />
I'm sorry if i've needlessly attacked one of your idols or something, but its the internet, and you cant do anything to get back at me for it, so i feel perfectly safe accusing a person i have nothing agains of cheating.<br />
besides, i dont consider cheating on a gameshow a bad thing. lol.  if i could do it i'd have absolutely no moral problems with it, and i'd go as far as i could too (without severely increasing my chance of getting caught and sued).<br />
<br />
@CivCube.  Realy?  wow, then i should almost consider trying for it.  i'd never get on, but still.  if the give you the categories teh day before, then that makes it WAY easier.</div></div><hr />

Ah yes, the mafia that is the trivia world.  An &quot;insider&quot;.  That explains all of it.  If I recall correctly, Al Capone was a major leader in the trivia mafia back in the twenties... :rolleyes: <br />
(That reminds me: &quot;Now, my story begins in 19-dickety-two. We had to say &quot;dickety&quot; 'cause that Kaiser had stolen our word &quot;twenty&quot;. I chased that rascal to get it back, but gave up after dickety-six miles... &quot;  But I digress...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ben E Gas</div><div class="date">Jul 13, 2004, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">did the guy really win 29 times in a row?  damn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hundegesicht</div><div class="date">Jul 13, 2004, 07:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used to be on a quiz team, and it consisted of essentially studying for 2 hours each day with someone else. It's not so much what information you know (though having a very broad base of &quot;lore&quot; is helpful) but instead training yourself to categorize already stored memory and withdraw and process the useful part very quickly. Seriously, there's no set of Jeopardy! questions that any given American with a moderate to good education couldn't answer if given a day or so to think through them all-Ken Jennings just knows how to recall information much faster than most people.<br />
<br />
And I took 2nd in the district for 3 years in a row because of this damn &quot;Steven&quot; guy who always beat me by about 10 points every year.  :mad:</div></div><hr />
