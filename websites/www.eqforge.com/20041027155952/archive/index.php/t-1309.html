<br />
I started customizing Civ - copying it to a separate directory, and changing *everything*. Now I am wondering about the limits for what one can do in this manner.<br />
<br />
I have changed the terrain graphics (The HiRes-pack was a great help), the unit graphics, some icons and other graphics, many of the ruler graphics, customized all the tribes, and the city names.<br />
<br />
Everything modern has been removed, as my project is to create an entirely &quot;ancient-medieval&quot; Civ2.<br />
<br />
This is *NOT* a scenario, as the changes are done to the files in the root directory. The point is, that one is supposed to choose &quot;Start New Game&quot;, only everything will be different. You are still supposed to choose from *all* the tribes, and start your empire building career from scratch. You are supposed to play in the same way as a regular game, only everything will have an &quot;ancient&quot; feel to it. And so far it looks great. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Now, my first question is:<br />
How do I make it so that the time limits are 4000 BC to 1500 CE, without having to make a scenario file?<br />
<br />
Second:<br />
Is it possible to make it so that certain scientific advances exclude others? Like you choose a path that you have to follow.. For instance, say you developed &quot;Eastern Thought&quot; (or something like that). That would give you the option to later develop Buddhism or Hinduism. But it would exclude the other path, which could be Judaism-&gt;Christianity/Islam. (This was just a hypothetic example)<br />
<br />
I have lots of other questions, but I'll come back to them.<br />

In addition to the game ending in the year 1500 CE, I would like the game to be as long as a 4000BC-2000CE game (the same number of total turns), so the early years would have to pass a little bit slower than they do now. 100 years passing in 1 turn was a little weird anyway...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oryx</div><div class="date">Mar 20, 2001, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. You cannot customize the time limits for the standard game. You can only do this with scenarios.<br />
2. The only way I can think of to even come close to the other thing is to have multiple rules files. You would run a batch file to install the desired set of rules. All tribes would play with the same rules and I suspect this is not what you want.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Mar 20, 2001, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Presumably what you are talking about is a modpack. There is no practical difference between a scenario and a mod pack for your purposes other than the fact that there is no starting map.<br />
<br />
My first sugestion is to make a scenario instead of a mod pack first. Then you can use the scenario tools plus if you make a mistake, you will be able to fix it.<br />
<br />
When you have finished, just copy the entire contents of the scenario file into the main folder and overwrite the original civ files.<br />
<br />
There are a few other things you can fiddle with that you can't in a scenario, like the launch menu screen and the labels files. You can leave these to the last after you are satisfied with your handiwork.<br />
<br />
p.s. There is a very recent thread on the finer points about the difference between a mod and a scenario which you can look up.<br />
<br />
The date stuff is stored in the Games.txt if I am not mistaken but again the simplest way to do this is to change the parameters in the scenario and overwrite the original games.txt.<br />
<br />
The second question refers to the tech tree which you can edit from the rules.txt. Again you can use the scenario tools or edit the rules.txt directly (prefer the former).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CornMaster</div><div class="date">Mar 20, 2001, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a good page about tech trees....but it only allows 2 branches.<br />
 http://sleague.apolyton.net/Guides/sldt_tech_tree_one.shtml <br />
<br />
If you want more....(say, 5 like I need) you will have to do it VERY differently....and it probably won't be very balanced.<br />
<br />
I've got 5 branches but mine HAS to be a scenario because my 5 starting techs can't be researched but are pre-requits for ALL other techs....so mine has to be a scenario.<br />
<br />
Anyway....hope this helps.<br />

They were really helpful. I will try out a few things, and also something I read at SLeague (not related to these 2 questions).<br />
