<br />
In my game, I have pampered my citizens with luxeries... they have 5.  &quot;We celebrate the king day&quot; has fireworks all over.  I goto war.  I modify my luxery percentage/city screens unil there is at least a balance of happy/unhappy citizens in each city.<br />
<br />
Next turn about 5 out of 40 citys smoke.  I modify them to balance the unhappy/happy. Some cities are even celebrating.  Next turn, my democracy is overthrown.  I am dumfounded.  7 turns of anarchy where there is no scientific research and NO production (manual mentions there should be 1/2 production, but I have nothing).<br />
<br />
So I bite the bullet and wait out the anarchy.  Democracy is implemented again.  A few turns later, same damn thing.<br />
<br />
What is triggering this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I have never had a government overthrown in CIV 3, and I am not that careful about it.  What is supposed to cause a government to collapse?  It is not as easy as CIV2 where two consecutive turns of civil disorder would cause anarchy.  I haven't seen any info on this.</div></div><hr />

Are you at war with anyone?  Sometimes you can be at war and forget about it because the enemy is a continent away and there's been no fighting for many turns.  If you've been at war for a really long time, Dems will eventually be overthrown.<br />
<br />
Sue for peace with all enemies and that should fix the problem.  You can click the heads of your unhappy citizens and you'll probably see something like &quot;just give peace a chance&quot; as a cause of unhappiness.<br />

Citizen unhappiness has always been the my biggest complaint of these games. Now I let the mayor handle it.  Course you still go after luxeries, etc, because happy workers are productive workers. And you can create an over all policy for all your cities and then make individual changes for cities you want to watch.<br />

<br />
Mainly if I knew WHY the Democracy was being overthrown (since I manually tried to keep the cities at least balance with happy/unhappy) it wouldn't have been a big deal.</div></div><hr />
