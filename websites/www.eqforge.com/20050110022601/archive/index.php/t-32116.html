<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kittenOFchaos</div><div class="date">Sep 15, 2002, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My DVD drive USED to be able to detect and run CDs.<br />
<br />
Now it will ONLY detect and thus be able to run DVDs...<br />
<br />
<br />
What could the problem be? <br />
<br />
It is unlikely in my opinion to be drivers as it used to work...when I last looked (a few days back when installing a slave harddisk) the cables were fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This problem has been bugging me for months...now I ACT and ask you guys what to do :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kittenOFchaos</div><div class="date">Sep 17, 2002, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you don't know what to do?<br />
<br />
Or you won't help me :(<br />
<br />
<br />
After all I've done for you :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padma</div><div class="date">Sep 17, 2002, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have any suggestions for you. :confused:<br />
<br />
Besides, what have you done for me lately? :p :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Sep 17, 2002, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I couldn't say much about it..seems like some sort of driver problem. I would try contacting the manufacturer about it. Sorry I can't be more of a help :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CornMaster</div><div class="date">Sep 17, 2002, 11:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok....let Dr. CornMaster help you.<br />
<br />
What do you mean by it won't detect CD's?  You put one in and nothing starts up?<br />
<br />
Or you put one in and nothing comes up in my computer?<br />
<br />
Also...have you installed and Creative products lately?  They install something called Disk Detector.  This often conflicts with some drives.<br />
<br />
Well...lets start here. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kittenOFchaos</div><div class="date">Sep 19, 2002, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I put a CD in the DVD player:<br />
<br />
The &quot;busy&quot; light lights up...for about 10 seconds then the drive ejects the CD -all CDs, it isn't prejudice ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for Creative products...my speakers are by creative, but I haven't installed any of their software -just use Windows default for sound card etc- onto my machine which has been recently formatted (the problem existed before the format).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Disk detector....I did a search for it, nothing. Do you have disk detectors exe line so I can try to &quot;run&quot; it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your interest Cornmaster...do you know any sites worth looking at concerning this sort of problem?<br />
<br />
:goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CornMaster</div><div class="date">Sep 19, 2002, 08:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there is a mechanical problem with the drive.  It if won't accept the CD....that's just bull****.<br />
<br />
Could be a dirty laser.  I believe DVD lasers are different then CD lasers....if the CD laser is dirty...but the DVD one fine, then that could be why it's ejecting CD.  You can pick up CD-ROM drive cleaners at most stores for 4 or 5 dollars.  Can't hurt to try. ;)<br />
<br />
However...they may use the same laser...so that idea is out the window.<br />
<br />
You got a diddly of a pickle of a jam here my friend.<br />
<br />
For a more tech based forums....I suggest http://forums.windrivers.com/cgi-bin/wd/index.php? (Windrivers)<br />
<br />
They have a whole load of techies overthere willing to help out. :)</div></div><hr />
