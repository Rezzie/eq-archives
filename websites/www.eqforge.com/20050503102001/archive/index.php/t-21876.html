<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">May 05, 2002, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last month's Game of the Month has been a very interesting one. First of all we've made an awesome record of 165 submissions! Secondly there has been an unusual amount of cultural victories: 86 (54 percent). The biggest reason for this was the fact that once you defeated the Babylonians and Persians you were trapped on your own continent and it was very hard getting on the main continent. Finally the top 11 results seem to be separated from the other results, so I think they deserve extra credit. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, let's look at the results:<br />
Gold: Cartouche Bee<br />
Silver: SirPleb<br />
Bronze: Lucky (with a diplomatic defeat! ;))<br />
<br />
Fastest conquest victory: Grey Fox<br />
Fastest domination victory: Aeson<br />
Fastest cultural victory: [pnp]dredd<br />
Fastest space race victory: Beard Rinker<br />
Highest score by diplomatic victory: SirPleb<br />
<br />
-----------------------<br />
<br />
Let's have it. Satisfied with your result? :)<br />
I am! This is the first time I had a score above average. [dance]<br />
<br />
By the way, Lucky thought he could get the diplomatic award with his result, but he forgot he needed to get a diplomatic victory for it. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">May 05, 2002, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all I´m really glad I finished this game before the deadline, only a few hours remained.<br />
Second I could have won in several way. Look at my saves and you´ll see that I only had 1 city per AI left, which were the English and Germans. I finished by using my last leader to build the UN, I could have also used it to hurry the last spaceship part. I could have destroyed the last 2 civs or conquered them.<br />
So it was a decision between SS, Conquest, Domination, Retirement WIN or Diplo Loss. :yeah:<br />
<br />
Anyway I´m still happy to be third (again). :cool:<br />

Red: fastest finish by conquest<br />
Blue: fastest finish by domination<br />
Yellow: fastest finish by culture<br />
Cyan: fastest finish by space ship<br />
Purple: highest score by diplomacy <br />
Highest score by diplomacy! No sign of diplo VICTORY.<br />
I didn´t matter this time, but it could in the future. ;)<br />
<br />
So, this GOTM was my first LOSS and my highest score in my HoF and another medal!<br />
:D<br />
<br />
EDIT: Almost forgot, congrats to everybody else! :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

But I've learned a lot of things this run and I expect to get an even better result next month. So watch out, SirPleb, here I come :) <br />
(Note that I say _next_ month, not this month. Deity level will prove challenging, though I hardly expect to survive for long. Ah well, maybe this month I'll get some work done. ;))<br />

Oh yeah, thanks Matrix for organizing this and congratulations to all winners.</div></div><hr />

I did not expect to see such high scores on a warlord game :confused: <br />
Can someone explain me how do u manage it ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3acad_maxscore.shtml<br />
<br />
My first GOTM and 117th, not too bad I guess, I'll probably try and milk this months game.  It's Deity though so I might get the crap beaten out of me by the AI ;).<br />
<br />
I was gonna ask why my score hadn't appeared but seeing as there was 165 entries it was a good job to do them all so quick.  Thanks Matrix :goodjob:.</div></div><hr />

That definitely gets my thumbs-up! :goodjob: What's sad is that I would have been very close to Lucky's 3rd place finish if my victory hadn't been triggered by the silly Zulus razing Japanese cities. Oh well. I'm hardly complaining. :)<br />
<br />
And I wouldn't have finished so highly if Aeson and others had gone for score instead of medals, so it all balances.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">May 05, 2002, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a shameless plug, I want to point out that I had the earliest diplomatic victory.<br />
<br />
I realized fairly early on that cultural would dominate the game winnings and that if I did not want to pursue the billions of cities ICS style strategy that my cultural victory would not compete in medal timing.<br />
<br />
If we gave a medal for number of times you succeeded in wedging a city in a one tile crack between two other civs cities and then culture flipping both the enemies without firing a shot, I could probabably claim that medal as well. I hate the way culture flipping is implemented in many ways but exploited the faulty system to just torture the other civs. At one point I took at two English armies and many other units.<br />
<br />
Submitted the early diplo victory partial as a protest vote against continuing the High Score Diplomatic medal because I think this continues to promote milking.<br />
<br />
Once you have the game in hand, end it in the cleanest and most enjoyable way possible. Milking for 1000 or 2000 years just really does not promote strategic game play in the big picture. Yes, keeping a dysfunctional group of psychos happy for 1000 to 2000 years while you milk away is a real challenge, but I think racing full speed ahead to be one of the vote options for the UN can be challenging as well.<br />
<br />
Too bad the coding did not allow the weak little Iroquois in GOTM7 to be a vote choice for the UN. (call this the Ghana scenario). Instead of everyone having to vote for two choices that had spent the whole game extorting money and luxuries from all the weaker civs, then the weaker civs could vote for the peacenik and really turn the aggressors on their ears.<br />
<br />
Also note that GOTM6 was lots of fun in spite of the respawning crap and other bugs in CIV3 v.17.<br />
<br />
Congrats to all the winners and thanks to all players.<br />
<br />
My vote continues to be for more mid-level games at the Monarch level and to include some declared specific challenges or unit modifications. Avoid Random maps at all costs. I can do that with my map generator. Lets have fun with the limited editing control tools that Firaxis has given us while continuing the civ focus rotation tradition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As always, A BIG THANK YOU to Matrix for all the hard work he puts in. :goodjob: :goodjob: <br />
<br />
Too bad the GOD Matrix didn't determine you have to WIN the game to get a medal..............in which case I could have snagged the Bronze from Lucky! ;)<br />
Just joking, Lucky........with a handle like that, what chance do we have?<br />
<br />
A BIG, BIG congrats to Cartouche Bee who emailed a couple of weeks ago that he was spending about an HOUR-A-TURN on the middle game of this GOTM!! Well, it sure paid off......AND you said you would do things differently/better on your next &quot;Milk Run&quot;!!........So, come on CB, SPILL THE BEANS!!.........Tell the rest of us 164 mere mortals the Secrets of YOUR Success!?  ;)<br />
<br />
As a parting suggestion, to avoid the Milk Runs, it sure would be nice if Firaxis would increase the End-of-Game Bonus so that it would be hard to decide whether to go for a &quot;Fast Finish&quot; or the &quot;Milk Run&quot;.<br />
Let's face it, it was immediately apparent (assuming that you're familiar with the calculation of the End-of-Game Scoring Bonus) that in GOTM 6 you had to milk the game to 2050AD to have ANY chance of a Medal!<br />
<br />
Of course Matrix could instigate a modified GOTM-Only scoring system?!..........For Example, if you doubled the score of anyone finishing in 1750AD or earlier (when there would be at least 200 turns left on the game!), Aeson with his REMARKABLE 700AD finish would have come in a close second with 8778 points!!   :)<br />
<br />
I know this a rather simplistic, off-the-cuff suggestion.............BUT those Milk Runs take a LOT of time!!!:crazyeye:</div></div><hr />

I think you should be very careful with fighting the milking thing, because before you know it your score is only dependent of the year of finish.<br />
<br />
For the GOTM for Civ2 we do this by square rooting the score before the early finish bonus is awarded. So the more points you have the less effect it has to get even bore points. I hope I make myself clear...</div></div><hr />

I am surprised to have picked up the gold medal. I used the information that SirPleb and Aeson have supplied to achieve a 'milk run'. I also added a couple of Bamspeedy worker dogpiles to run the score up a bit. Very time consuming moving and ferrying units around but an educational experience. ooops forgot to mention Mapstat.

So I am pleased. :-)<br />

I might have to wait until next month to play the GOTM since I am awaiting the 1.21 patch for Mac.<br />

It enables you to see how many tiles per terrain type the whole world, unclaimed territory and every civ in the game posses.<br />
Thus you can see whether you are close to the domination limit, which is 2/3 of all land tiles of the map.<br />

Personally I find it time consuming and rather boring. That's why I play with one objective: earliest victory (don't care at all about the score).<br />
Here are the earliest victories in GOTM6 (previous to 1600AD):<br />
<br />
1) Aeson (Dom): 700AD<br />
2) Grey Fox (Con): 1320AD<br />
3) [pnp]dredd (Cul): 1415AD<br />

<br />
Congrats to all those fast finishers :goodjob: .<br />
<br />
This was my first GOTM (not gonna even try this month's deity game).  I was one of those milkers, but I must follow the tips from these faster finishers if I want an even higher score.  I didn't reach the domination point until the 16-1700's.  At first I thought I would be in the top 5, but when I heard about how early some of the other players got to the domination limit, I knew I wouldn't get a medal.  I already know some of the mistakes I made, so I am a little better now.<br />
<br />
(just for fun: IIRC Aeson achieved a 'peaceful cultural domination', therefore lafayette is #1 for military domination    ) <br />
<br />
I think it's so ironic that Aeson got the peaceful domination with who else but GANDHI!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">May 07, 2002, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm another of those players who was &quot;milking&quot; the game, partly because I was lucky enough to get an early Forbidden Palace and wanted to see just what score I could get, partly because I had never tried milking a game before and wanted to try it. With that said though, I could have triggered a domination victory around 1400AD, or even possibly a few turns earlier than that. Most of the other high scores similarly conquered the world early on. So there actually was not much of a difference between the early finishers and the high scorers; all of them played very good games. Score is not the most important thing for me in a GOTM at all; I plan on doing a OCC in one of the future games on a small map (as long as the starting position is decent). I think more important than &quot;winning&quot; or &quot;losing&quot; in the GOTM is whether you learn something or not, and if you enjoyed playing it. I definitely learned some things from milking GOTM6, though I will say that it was a bit tedious and I don't plan on doing it very often.</div></div><hr />

What was the earliest diplomatic victory?  Anyone recall why the diplomatic medal was left to highest score, and not changed to fastest victory like the others?</div></div><hr />

I think it was skill and well earned by Cartouche Bee. (Congratulations Cartouche!)<br />
<br />
I could try claiming that it was because I went for Diplomatic and that slowed me down. But on this particular map that wouldn't be true - could have done both at the same time on this one. I didn't play it as well as it could be played. And I'm glad Cartouche Bee proved it! :)</div></div><hr />

An early Diplomatic win would often be an easy game. Breeze through without building much or doing much. At a low difficulty level it would help to do fast research, but then it is much the same as Space, just a lot less research. At higher difficulty levels the research effort wouldn't be as big a factor.<br />
<br />
But a high scoring Diplomatic victory can I think, depending on the map, be a unique challenge. For the maximum score part, you need to gain control of most of the world. That's at odds with the Diplomatic part - for that you need to leave at least two Civs alive and one of them has to like you. If you've gone to major war with a Civ and have razed any of their cities, they'll never vote for you. So it is a different kind of challenge to both get the high (control the world milked) score and at the same time to get the necessary vote(s).<br />
<br />
In GOTM6, because of the Warlord setting and the map shape, I think it turned out that both things could be done at the same time. (Maximum possible score and the Diplomatic victory.) But on other maps (GOTM7 will be one I think) it will be a tough combination. It will probably not be possible to get both the highest score and the diplomatic win in the same game, will require different strategies.</div></div><hr />

Well thanks for the compliment SirPleb. However, I doubt that I actually played the game better than yourself or Aeson [and many others]. Yes, I had a higher score but that was only because there is no cap on the size of a city. By dumping workers onto a couple of cities I was able to add a few thousand points onto my internal score [ think it was up around 18000 or 19000 at the end]. Personally, I like the early win and that helps in the milking process. I only tried the 'milk run' cause it was a low level game, don't know when or if I will do it again.<br />

<br />
I still think the God Matrix should consider either &quot;upping&quot; the End-Of-Game Bonus or &quot;lowering&quot; the actual score BEFORE the EOG Bonus is applied so that Fast-Finishes have a chance for a medal in the lower-difficulty or larger map games?! :)<br />
<br />
Matrix has a formula for Civ 2 GOTM Scoring, so how about for Civ 3 GOTM too?<br />

I had a fresh crop of workers every turn so pollution was a nuisance but not out of control. I cleaned up any pollution each turn and once that chore was done, I piled any excess workers into existing cities to run up the population. [For your future reference! ;) ] I had my main core cities set to wealth, had a pretty good hunk of change at the end, somewhere in the 60000 range.<br />

If auto, which keys did you punch?<br />

I did lots of manual moves so I didn't have any units just waiting around for a job but I also used SHIFT-A and SHIFT-P. Problem with SHIFT-A is that they will only send two units to work on the site so SHIFT-P was better cause they would pile up on trouble spots. I also skipped through units so that the automatic moves [units with previous orders] were done first and then gave orders if any trouble spots still existed [I checked for a trouble spot by applying the order SHIFT-P, if the unit did not move then there was no pollution on the continent to clean]. If a unit was set to SHIFT-P I was able to reassign the unit after the automatic moves if no work had been actually done. That permitted me to top up a city in that case.<br />
