The other is to pull down lux to content level.<br />
<br />
The cities are in need of other improvements to get up to 12, i.e. harbors, MP and settler improvements.<br />
<br />

<br />
Things to consider:<br />
I never got an answer last time of what to do with the settler we aquired close to China. Any suggestions where to settle it.<br />
<br />
Taxrates, workers and einsteins...<br />
<br />
Build queues...<br />
<br />
Plans for getting wonders, settlers (expansion) and foreign traderoutes...<br />
<br />
I hope I followed the plan all right. <br />
<br />
It was a dilemma to chose between ending celebrations and aqueducts. We now have 7 more workers/pops + some from the other smaller cities than without them.</div></div><hr />

Not too much to say for me, I'm not into the game yet. But...Berlin could well be the mother of our army! We won't have to build any units in the future, we can just buy barb units. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2003, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's one reason to place a city on that continent. Placing it under the swamp with three visible specials and two river squares would be nice, get it some protection (we already have a non-legion) and set it for building dips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2003, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have a settler on the Trireme?  I think the Berlin Barb Farm plan has merit.  That might be a good name for the city, actually :lol:  Or maybe Zwelgje should name it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2003, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bribing barbarians is an excellent idea, maybe we should try to bribe one barbarian for every other caravan we deliver or something like that. However, we should take care not to found a city too close to Berlin because then we could get into a situation where we would be unable to bribe a barbarian because it would be supported by Berlin Barb Farm (an excellent name for a city in this area). So we should keep an eye towards founding a city on the island (?) W of the trireme but maybe explore a bit before deciding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2003, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hopefully we have enough money to bribe the Barbarians. For one thing, we should start to defend against hte Barbarians if they do try to attack us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2003, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Founding Berlin Barb Farm on the island would necessitate keeping a boat around to ferry dips to the mainland to bribe barbs, though it would effectively prevent the barbs from ever attacking the city.  I think a better alternative is the forest at the tip of the small peninsula directly south of the trireme's current location.  It is a 4-special site!! on defensible terrain (assuming we don't irrigate first) and we can easily control the barbs' access points to the city.  We should have dips out there buying up any approaching barbs anyway, so I don't think there would be any real danger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 07, 2003, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A summary of the Mininstry of Domestic Affairs recommendations will be posted near 1200 GMT on June 8 if funxus hasn't finished playing by then :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll wait for that one.:) It's 1205 GMT now...;)<br />
<br />
EDIT: I'll start playing now, I have some studying to do too...</div></div><hr />
