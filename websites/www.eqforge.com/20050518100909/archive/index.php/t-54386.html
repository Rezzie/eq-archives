<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 02:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In response to the questions:<br />
1.  I am running for three offices, Trade, Chief Justice, and Public Defender.  I would take CJ first, Trade second, and PD third.<br />
2.  Established players certainly may help newer players get involved and get into office.  They should not campaign for them, but they should give them some pointers and help them to become established.<br />
<br />
And now for a speech:<br />
I certainly think that I am the best candidate for Chief Justice and Public Defender. I will carry out the functions of my office to the best of my ability, if elected.  If elected, I will certainly help in the passage of a new CoL and possibly a CoS, and to make sure that they do not have unnecessary laws and/or standards.  I have two terms of Public Defender experience (and I am the incumbent there) and I believe it is time for me to move up to Chief Justice, though I will certainly serve as Public Defender for a third term if necessary.  I am a relatively new member of the demogame, having joined just before the Demogame II term 8 elections, and I think being newer works to my advantage, as I have certainly been here long enough to fully understand all written and unwritten rules but I am still relatively new and eager to serve in these offices, especially Chief Justice.  As a final statement, all voters should vote for me for CJ and PD, as I believe I can do the job better than all other candidates.</div></div><hr />

2, domestic department and Judge Advocate.<br />
Ive been JA for two very quiet terms but i know the constitution and would like to continue on to help make new laws<br />

2. Do you believe that established players should help newer players to get involved and get into office?<br />
<br />
Yes, they are the future</div></div><hr />

<br />
1)  What in your opinion, is the most important role of the judiciary in the Demo Game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">May 28, 2003, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In response to AJ's question:  Yes, we do need a CoL to run the demogame better.  I will contribute to its creation and approval.  I will also make sure that is restricted and does not have needless laws.  As for a CoS, it may not be required if we can incorporate a few points of the old CoS into the CoL, which I would support.  <br />
In response to Bill's question:  It depends on the state of the demogame at the time.  For this term, getting new laws passed would be the Judiciary's most important role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">May 28, 2003, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am running for just the one office, Judge Advocate. <br />
I am very much in favour of helping our new citizens become involved in the game. As a private citizen I have been active in encouraging new members to stand for the elected Board of Commissioners who will assess the fairness of polls. I also have a proposal under discussion which will encourage new members  to have a greater participation in government.<br />
<br />
I believe that our constitution should exist as the main source of our laws. I am firmly committed to having only the minimum number of laws necessary to effect the smooth running of the game. Any Code of Laws should seek not to limit what we can do but to improve the quality of the game experience. Also I hope that a Code of Standards will not be necessary since I advocate cooperation over legislation. <br />
<br />
Unlike some other candidates I do not believe that the Judiciary should have any role whatsoever in the coding of our laws. Only the Legislative branch has that right. The Judiciary exists solely to ensure that the laws are applied correctly and fairly to all without exception. If the Judiciary seeks involvement in lawmaking then this will have a detrimental effect on all branches of government, the citizenry, and the game itself. Therefore if like me you believe that the Judiciary has no place in lawmaking<br />
Vote Peri</div></div><hr />
