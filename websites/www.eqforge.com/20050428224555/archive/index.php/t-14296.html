<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Headmaster</div><div class="date">Jan 13, 2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's unfair that everyone can read the spoiler talks because you can get information about enemy, resource and continent location before starting the game.<br />
<br />
My suggestion: Make the spoiler talks thread password-protected (or if that isn't possible make a private subforum). Everyone who reaches 1 AD sends his savegame to the GOTM mod and then he can give you access to the spoiler forum. By 1 AD you should know where your enemies, resources etc. are anyway, so reading the others' posts won't help you very much.</div></div><hr />

If someone wants to gain an unfair advantage, nothing is really stopping them.  Putting a password on the spoiler threads just means they'd have to play through and see where everything is, then restart.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why ? Because they could play once, cheating like hell just to see what's up with the map &amp; the second game they would know anyway...<br />
