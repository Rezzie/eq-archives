<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We need a new list of city names and before posting a poll I need some ideas. I will post a build queue poll soon, it includes building 6-8 engineers that will found cities, mainly in Barbaria and Jayneland but also on the northern tip of Coresux.<br />
<br />
I notice that a few of the advisors and other people here have no cities named for them, for example Duke, Leowind and CivGeneral.<br />
<br />
And maybe we could use more movies than just The Core to get city name ideas, how about something like Neo, Morpheus and Trinity ? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like those Matrix names. How about Zion and Nebukadnessar?<br />
<br />
IIRC BP is named after Duke (the Duke of Marlborough lives in Blenheim Palace) and I think Neumatic is named after Leowind (don't really know why). That doesn't mean we shouldn't name other cities after them though.</div></div><hr />

Someone want to go with the name 'New Doughnut City?'  :p  That's too long (15 chars max, iirc), but you could use &quot;New Doughnutia&quot; or the simplified form &quot;New Donut City&quot;<br />
<br />
I never knew Neumatic was for Leowind.  I still don't know where that one came from.  He could use another city...<br />
<br />
The sarcastic smart*ss in me wants to name a city &quot;Civ3 Demo Game&quot; because then we might be able to find CivGeneral there.  ;)  Sorry I couldn't resist...Bad Tim! :spank:</div></div><hr />

Here's an old post I found:<br />
Originally posted by Jayne <br />
I went for Neumatic for the SSC after outgoing Science Minister Sir Leowind, and Lucy's Crossing for the River Bridge city at C6 (hopefully!;) ). <br />
It doesn't say what it has got to do with him though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lucy is Jayne's daughter. The names associated with Duke and Leowind are far from obvious (I had forgotten Neumatic and Blenheim Palace had something to do with them) so naming some new cities after them and using more 'obvious' names is an option.<br />
<br />
I now remember how BP is associated with Duke but I have no idea what the connection is between Neumatic and Leowind.</div></div><hr />

I thought that was just the city name he chose to represent him. :crazyeye:</div></div><hr />
