<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 11, 2002, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Awesome free web browser, that is!<br />
<br />
I have just started using Opera 6.03 after testing it for several hours this weekend, and it is better than Netscape -- and staggeringly superior to MS IE!!<br />
<br />
First, it is super fast.  MS IE and Netscape are real foot draggers, in comparison.  Note:  I run a 450 MHz CPU, which is slower than many of you, and the speed factor is more pronounced at lower speeds.<br />
<br />
Opera eliminates all complaints I can think of against IE, including the terribly annoying popup situation.  It also totally eliminates the &quot;stealing of focus&quot; that IE does (where you're doing one thing, and suddenly another window opens and now without your choice).  Yes, we all know MS likes to take away your choices in life, but Opera (and Netscape, which has been my main browser) gives teh choice and power back you you, the People of the world :).<br />
<br />
Opera is amazingly customizable... compared to MS IE.  Netscape 6.23 is better than MS IE, but not as good as Opera in this regard.<br />
<br />
Another excellent thing about Opera is an extensive (and customizable/relocatable) program bar, where you can have dozens of websites open at the same time in a SINGLE window (much like the File Sharing programs that PaleHorse76 and Blue Monday have reviewed in Computer Talk).  But the really superb part is something most users have no clue about.... system resources!!!!  I watch them like a hawk, since (even if you have a gigabyte of RAM) once system resources are depleted, your system will freeze or crash.  Many programs, including many MS programs, do not handle their own resources properly (they &quot;leak&quot;), and IE is notorious for this.  I have never been able to open dozens of windows with IE, and not crash (or destablize)  the system as I surfed... ESPECIALLY if other programs were running.  <br />
<br />
Opera hardly makes a dent in resources, which means I can run notepad, Civilization, screen capture, image viewing, ad trapping, and lots of other programs at the same time!  Attempting the same thing with MS IE will crash the system, and I watch it happen as Mike Micro Meter (see freeware thread in Computer Talk) shows the depletion of resources.  The programmers at Opera, so far, seem to be able to keep their sh!t in one sock (a very good technical thing ;) ).  MS should consult with such people if they were interested in learning how to write applications for MS OSs.  :lol:<br />
<br />
I recommend that you take time (a couple hours) and go thru all the amazing stuff that Opera can do.  Read all the tips (50).  Customize all the cool things, including the locations of the various toolbars.  Do not uninstall your current browser.... keep it, even if you love the speed, power, compactness, and outstanding features of Opera.<br />
<br />
If anyone is wondering about bookmarks, Opera can handle importing both Netscape and IE.  It has a funtion to automatically use IE bookmarks, but I have not tested the auto function.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now for the bad things.  Well, so far... there is one thing I do not like about Opera, and I will be talking with them about fixing it, if I cannot hack it in the registry when I get time.  That is the location of the temporary &amp; cached files.  I have not been able to see a way to change the default locaton of the file cache (this is where hundreds of images, pages, and other files are stored on your hard disk, to speed page viewing).  This is important for me (but likely not to most other people), since I have a specific drive letter (the E: drive) that contains &amp; collects all temporary and cache files from all Applications and all Operating Systems on my machine.  This reduces fragmentation rates (especially on the C: drive) , and improves system performance over time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other than that, I have nothing critical to report about Opera.  <br />
<br />
EDIT:  Update.  There are some websites were some MS-specific features only work on MS browsers.   There also may be slight formatting differences between different browsers.  Some are cussed and discussed in the thread.  Unknown Soldier has some good screenshots of some Opera and MS IE format differences in some webpages on some sites.<br />
<br />
<br />
I strongly recommend that all CFC users try Opera.  It is very well behaved, is very fast, loaded with features, is very small to install, and so far, superior to MS IE in every way, and superior to Netscape in most ways.<br />
<br />
I encourage people to list and talk about both the good things and the bad things about their browsers, especially features and settings that help/hinder surfing CFC.    To me, the speed &amp; popup handling alone makes Opera the best for use at CFC.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Here (http://www.opera.com/download/get.pl?platform=win&amp;force=6.03) is the link to Download Opera.  You can use Opera on a PC, Mac, Linux, and more!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This just in:  I have found that Opera actually has a built in language translation... you just cilck on a word or phrase that you want translated, and choose the language you want it translated to, and it uses a translation engine (off site) to translate it!<br />
<br />
Wait!  Even more... it will also define words, look up words in multiple encyclopedias... hey, this is really easy and helpful, esp. if you write a lot or want to know more about  a word(s).<br />

It seems that Opera must have been mindreaders for CFC, hehe.  They made those functions soooo easy to access and use, that you can change them page by page with almost no effort!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a tech forum question.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chiefpaco</div><div class="date">Aug 11, 2002, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Opera.  One downside is the ad banner, since I have not registered it.  However, I really don't mind, and gives me something to watch between page loads (which seem shorter).  Another is the tables of some pages - but they are few and far between.  The hotlist isn't as clean as IE's favourites, IMHO, but very functional.  I also reserve IE for stuff like banking and other real important stuff since those often have to detect Netscape or IE.<br />
<br />
Here's some more stuff I like about it:<br />
- statistics at the bottom while loading web pages.  It shows way more detail than IE so I know more about what I'm loading and how far it is getting.<br />
<br />
- I really like the &quot;continue browsing where I left off&quot; feature after it may crash.  It can open each window I was last using when it crashes.  It crashes a lot less than my IE, but when it does, I load it up and it does the rest for me.<br />
<br />
- Mouse gestures.  Mouse moves to navigate can be very handy.<br />
<br />
- Pop-up refusal as a quick integrated preference.<br />
<br />
- Auto-reloading of pages on a timer.  Very handy for this forum!<br />
<br />
- Handier locations of open windows in the right-click menu and the ability to open windows in the background.<br />
<br />
- Decent Integeration with utilities and plug-ins.<br />
<br />
There's also all the reasons you gave.  There are enough real big bonuses to me to outweigh the small negatives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 11, 2002, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@ AoA:  The poll is here because it relates directly to solving some of the site-related problems with popups, especially focus, animated GIFs, icons, and ads.   There have been a lot of threads here about how to solve those issues, and except for Ad blocking, Opera seems to solve them all.  In fact, that is the reason I started testing Opera for surfing here at CFC.</div></div><hr />

Well, I hope people coming to site feedback with Ad, focus, image, animation, etc. questions still find the thread.<br />

I just posted a graphic, and you can look at the bottom choice out of the File ---&gt; Quick Preferecnes to solve any banking or similar issues that must detect a certain browser.  They only do that to make sure a browser can go into the secure mode, which Opera naturally can (look at the &quot;locked&quot;/'Unlocked&quot; icon to see when it is secure).<br />
<br />
Many of the features you listed are simply totally impossible with IE, and Netscape.  Once people use them and see how they work.... IE in particular will seem pre-historic by comparison.<br />
<br />
<br />
I must admit, even as a programmer myself, I am totally blown away with how Opera is able to do far far far more than IE (and Netscape), yet run more stable, be much much smaller, run faster, and in almost every case, perform tasks and options in a superior manner.   I guess more than anything, it shows average users how little we have come to expect from software in the last 8 to 10 years, in particular, since MS has spread it's tentacles so thoroughly into the world of software development (and bloat code in particular).<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am not too pleased with my own self for putting off it off for so long... I should have tested Opera montha ago!  Life would have been much simpler, and my computer even more stable!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe you are using the &quot;Offline&quot; mode (out of the &quot;File&quot; menu)?<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are connected to the Internet (I assume so, since you posted :D ), then what the message means is that something in your system is not allowing communication for the application (Opera, in this case).  It might be a firewall, blocking of some sort, proxy setting, something along those lines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno about speed.This thread took around 45 seconds to load.Not fast thats for sure.Another site I visited did seem to load alot faster.So the jury is still out.<br />
<br />
Seems ok though.It has just as many features as any browser.90% of them I never use anyway.</div></div><hr />

Yours was actaully the &quot;last straw&quot;, when I decided I should look into other alternatives  :D.   Be sure and post if Opera causes crashes like IE was doing.  I suspect it will not, due to the way they program it.  I cannot believe the stablity of it (I have special programs that watch some techincal things, as applicatons run... or crash).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You've got some mis-adjusted settings, or some other system situation, then.  I've run NS 4.76, NS 6.23, MS IE 5.01 SP1, and Opera 6.03, and Opera beats them all.  The only real &quot;downside&quot; that I've yet discovered was in fact pointed out by Unknown Soldier... there are some formatting MS has with all non-MS browsers, though the would has known about MS's machinations in this arena for a long time.    <br />
<br />
When NS 7 Comes out, I'll be giving that a close look, too, as I've been a NS user since the 0.9x beta releases days after they put it out.    <br />
<br />
You should look into your File --&gt; Preferences ---&gt;Network ----&gt; history &amp; Cache... there are lot of settings, and they can dramatically affect things.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have not looked at 3rd party add ons yet, as today I've put it through a lot of tests.   A cache manager is simply a program that looks in the temp or cache directory, and lets you view, move, edit, etc. the contents.  Cache files have really oddball names, and cache managers alleviate that.<br />
<br />
Netscape, Opera, Winamp... and probably lots of ohter programs have skins.  Some are actually pretty good.  Even the website GC has skins... so many choices, so little time!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've tried it and it is much better than IE...very fast, non-resource leeching etc.<br />
<br />
However the point still remains that some webpages don't display properly in it...in fact too many for my liking didn't so now I use editplus as I browser (well it uses the some data as IE but is better)<br />
<br />
Also there was something really annoying (I don't know if this is still a problem with it) which was how it would wait till all the pictures had loaded before displaying the page. unfortunatley for me, there happened to be a broken image link on that page so the page wouldn't display at all.</div></div><hr />

I may install it, but my stupid ISP always brings up Internet Explorer when it dials in. I'll still try it though.  Is there any spyware that comes with it though?  Because that is the one thing that I hate most.  And also, how is the uninstall?  Does it leave a lot in the registry, or does it have a good uninstaller?  I hate programs that stick around, and I fins myself deleting stuff from them months down the road.  This includes registry keys and files on my hard drive.  And that blacksilver looks sweet!  That probably will convince me to try it out anyway.  Nothing better than a nice looking program that runs better, faster, and has more options than some MS integrated piece of junk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baseballtwin86</div><div class="date">Aug 12, 2002, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not bad.  Here is a quick overview of what I saw.<br />
<br />
Great page loads, a lot of nice information that I like alot such as documents images etc.<br />
<br />
http://members.lycos.co.uk/uploadserver/progress.jpg<br />
<br />
Would have been nice to be able to customize the toolbar.  Be able to delete the News, Messaging, and E-mail directories.<br />
<br />
I love having the windows pop up in the browser.  There is nothing worse than having my start bar covered with 10 IE windows, 5 GIMP windows, WinAmp, etc.  Can't figure out which window is which.  Great job there :) .<br />
<br />
I love the pop-up blocking enabled, however some java popups don't work.  I use a WebFTP at work to upload stuff to my web pages, and it wouldn't pop open once I enabled no popups.  Nice customization of that would be nice.  Like enabling certain URL's to popup.<br />
<br />
Like everyone else, a better CSS handling is crucial to this browser.  The only reason why I probably won't be using this all the time.  The place where I am typing this right now in the post reply section is white instead of gray.<br />
<br />
http://members.lycos.co.uk/uploadserver/white.jpg<br />
<br />
This is also true for all input text thigs.<br />
<br />
The links are messed up.  The underline is further down in relation to the text, and on the CFC forum index, the underlines interfere with the forum descriptions.<br />
<br />
http://members.lycos.co.uk/uploadserver/index.jpg<br />
<br />
Just typical CSS issues.  Various other things were messed up.  This included the collapse and expand buttons at GIMPland (they didn't work and didn't look right either).<br />
<br />
I was very impressed with the stability though.  It runs extremely fast, and I can notice it very well on my T1 at work.  The features are very good with the browser, but it just needs to improve its CSS handling.  Other than that, and the ad grr!, not bad at all.  The features really do show that MS needs to get it in gear, and reallly, this browser would be far superior to IE, if Microsoft didn't have their grubby little hands over every feature of the web.  In closing, I would urge everyone to try it out, as I did like it a lot.  It will stay on my computer, and I will probably use it often.  The features are really awesome, and it is fast.  I was really surprised by the quality of it.</div></div><hr />

Mine do not look like that.  Mine look alomst identical to IE.  No overlap.  It must be a font, or size, etc. issue.  There are lots of CSS options you can choose in Opera, too.  Even your personal choices, which can override the CSS of the websites.  It is in Opera's Preferences, Fonts, Page Style.  I have not fiddled with my settings too much, though.<br />
<br />
I love the pop-up blocking enabled, however some java popups don't work. I use a WebFTP at work to upload stuff to my web pages, and it wouldn't pop open once I enabled no popups. Nice customization of that would be nice. Like enabling certain URL's to popup. <br />
Right, but you understand that a popup is a popup... it is not ad-blocking software, and Opera does not maintain a database to block certain popup sources.  If you block popups, then it affects all.  Unless they use java to make a new window, for instance.<br />
<br />
You need ot use software like AtGuard, or such, to go after ads.  Opera makes it easier than anyone else to control what sites do on your machine, but is not an ad-blocker.<br />
<br />
Would have been nice to be able to customize the toolbar. Be able to delete the News, Messaging, and E-mail directories. <br />
You can.  I did.  I got rid of all that stuff you listed, and addd super search &amp; find in page.   Plus some other stuff.  I only have exactly what I want, and nothing else.  You just need to change the settings (use the dropdown menus from &quot;View&quot;).</div></div><hr />

I havn't seen any difference identifying as different browsers.Either the site likes it,or it doesn't.Most of what I visit is Opera freindly.<br />

I also examine the Registry by hand after installing programs.  I have a &quot;system&quot; to look at all the places a program can activate itself (e.g, what is listed in the HOWTO thread on Registry info).<br />
<br />
I might know what the inconsistancies you are referring to, Smash.  I have 3 peices of software that monitor all TCP/IP traffic, and more if I'm curious about something going on.  The CFC site often delays in responding, and I watch this in real time.  If you were not using at least something like even System Monitor, you might attribute those delays to the Broswer (even IE or NS).  When the data flows, then what the Browser does with it is what's important, as is how the Browser handles lots of data, lots of windows, window changes, etc.  These are some of what Opera is doing so fast.    On a fast machine, the differences will be less obvious.... but if you are doing multi-tasking, then there will be fewer CPU cycles left over, and Opera's efficiency can really help other programs, too.  Anyone that uses and INTERNAL modem is also greatly helped by Opera, because of all the cycles that modern internal modems push off on the CPU to save the $6 to $9 in manufacture costs that it would take to add the onboard modem chip that does the job in external and older internal modems.</div></div><hr />

I have not tried the built-in E-mail or News reader.  If anyone does, be sure and post what you find.<br />

I use Eudora for my external E-mail (and have for 10 years).  Opera does a great job of handing off the e-mail to it.  It can also use any other e-mail, like MS's.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 13, 2002, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, for those that were wondering about compliance and standards.  I normally just review white papers, like the W3C standards.  Over 15 year ago, when I first began keeping an eye on MS and how/why it was delivering such terrible and bug-ridden DOS  (anyone remember the DOS 4.xx debacles?), I started looking at standards.  Today, those are easy to locate and read... and they are at the core of successful computer growth and improvement for end users.   The stagnation and repression, primarily by MS, but also at times by companies like Symantec and Netscape, has hurt the PC world, and set it back by at least 5, and more like 7 to 8 years.  This is why software is still so primitive on the PC.<br />
<br />
Now that's outta the way, I finally decided to look to Opera's website to see what they have to say about standards, or if they deny the whole thing and shift the blame like MS typically does.  It turns out Opera is very up front about exactly and precicesly they do and do not support.  I will paste some of the most relevant sections.  It will make more sense to HTML programmers, and likely be boring for plain end users.  But here are the answers, in closed form (meaning no equivocation, or parsing of words, or pulling a Clinton):<br />
<br />
<br />
Opera HTML support<br />
<br />
Opera version 6 supports HTML 4.01 with these exceptions: <br />
<br />
1.1 Intrinsic event attributes<br />
<br />
These attributes are not supported: <br />
<br />
Any event attribute for option<br />
ondblclick<br />
<br />
1.2 Form elements<br />
<br />
These form elements are not supported: visual feedback for button, label, legend. These form attributes are not supported: accept, accept-charset, for.<br />
<br />
1.3 Table elements<br />
<br />
Opera supports HTML 3.2 style table elements fully (ie. table, caption, tr, th and td). Opera handles tfoot properly (it is always displayed at the bottom at a table), otherwise Opera doesn't support the new HTML 4.01 elements (col, colgroup, thead, tfoot,  tbody) and attributes (abbr, axis, char, charoff, frame, headers, rules and scope). Opera doesn't assign styles to the grouping elements (tbody, tfoot and thead). <br />
<br />
1.4 Other issues<br />
<br />
The a element attributes coords, charset, and hreflang and shape.<br />
The frameborder attribute is not supported.<br />
The bidirectional override element bdo and the dir attribute. The lang attribute is not supported (in for instance q).<br />
The attributes accesskey, tabindex are not supported.<br />
Opera supports object, but not the attributes align, classid, codebase, codetype and standby. For plug-ins embed is used.<br />
Opera doesn't support the applet attributes align and archive<br />
Opera has no particular support for link apart from rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;, nor for the meta attribute scheme or the head attribute profile.<br />
The deprecated hr noshade attribute has no effect, neither does the deprecated attribute compact. CSS should be used for this.<br />
Opera follows the HTML 4.01 specification for script and noscript. If any script element doesn't execute, all subsequent noscript element are displayed. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
CSS support<br />
<br />
Opera 6 supports all of CSS1. <br />
<br />
Opera 6 supports all of CSS2 with the exception of: <br />
<br />
Opera 6 is a visual browser and does not support Aural CSS <br />
these properties: clip, cursor, direction, font-size-adjust, font-stretch, marker-offset, marks, text-shadow, unicode-bidi, and all outline properties<br />
Linux only: the system values on the font property as well as system colors<br />
the values added to list-style-type in CSS2<br />
these property/value combination: 'display: marker', 'text-align: &lt;string&gt;', 'visibility: collapse', 'content: &lt;url&gt;', 'overflow: scroll', 'overflow:auto'<br />
named pages (as described in section 13.3.2)<br />
the '@font-face' construct<br />
<br />
All CSS2 selectors are supported with the exception of: <br />
<br />
:first-child, :focus, :lang<br />
combinations with pseudo-classes before other selectors<br />
<br />
2.1 Some differences of style from Internet Explorer and Netscape<br />
<br />
When using the Opera browser, you may notice that some pages are displayed differently than in other browsers. In most cases, the differences are caused by errors in the pages that are being displayed. Few Web pages are authored according to W3C's specifications which Opera supports. Opera tries, to some extent, to replicate the errors in browsers from Netscape and Microsoft, but we prioritize implementing the specificaions. For a list of rendering differeces between Opera and Netscape/ Microsoft, please read below.<br />
<br />
The color of an HR in Opera is a background property, and Opera accepts all background styles as well as generated content. In NN4 and IE it is a foreground property (color). NN6 does the right thing too (there is a difference between Opera and NN6 if generated content, :before and :after, is used).<br />
Link underlines can be different in Opera and NN6 than older browsers (the underline one color, the text another). This is a consequence on CSS2 rules on text-decoration.<br />
IE5/Windows is mistaken in their handling of height and width properties, in effect making Opera (and NN6) boxes appear larger. This is fixed in IE6 in compliant mode.<br />
IE5 also has an issue with positioning, as a positioned element should be positioned to the nearest containing positioned element, not the containing element.<br />
Positioning of background images is relative to the element box, not the window. This means that in Opera, a image placed with body{background-position: center center} will be roughly in the middle of a page, not in the middle of the window.<br />
You would normally want to apply padding to the body element, and not margin (which is the margin between the body and the head/html elements).<br />
Preformatting of blocklevel content. The allowed content in PRE is inline, not block. This means that content will not be preformatted when a block level element (like a headline) appears, &lt;pre&gt;Pre-formatted&lt;h3&gt;Headline&lt;/h3&gt;Not pre- formatted&lt;/pre&gt;. In NN and IE &lt;h3&gt;Headline&lt;/h3&gt;Not pre-formatted&lt;/pre&gt; will be preformatted too.<br />
Note that while it is possible to style form controls in Opera, you can't make them look like anything other than form controls, eg by setting background color. The CSS specification doesn't require form control widgets to be styleable, and that can be in breach with the operating system UI guidelines. We still plan to support it one day.<br />
While Netscape 6 is a great leap forward in standards compliance relative to the Netscape 4 series, Mozilla is better. For more information on Mozilla, see the Mozilla site.<br />
The CSS improvements in IE6 are already implemented in Opera. This means that IE6's display of web pages in standards- compliant mode is much closer to Opera's web page display. For further information, see the Microsoft documentation on IE6.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 13, 2002, 01:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">XML support<br />
<br />
<br />
Opera 6 can parse and display XML documents. Documents with Content-type &quot;text/xml&quot; will be treated as an XML document. If a Content-type is not available, the &quot;.xml&quot; file extension will also make the document be treated as XML. <br />
<br />
3.1 XML and CSS<br />
<br />
In order to display an XML document, a CSS style sheet should be present. Authors can attach style sheets to their XML documents through a processing instruction. Here is a simple example: <br />
<br />
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;<br />
&lt;?xml-stylesheet href=&quot;shakespeare.css&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot;?&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
If no style sheet is present and the page is not namespaced to HTML, Opera 6 will use the initial values on all CSS properties to display the document. All elements will be inline, and all text will be rendered in the same font. <br />
<br />
3.2 XSL and XSLT<br />
<br />
Opera does not support XSL formatting objects, and neither does it natively support XSLT transformations. XML documents transformed server side will be parsed and displayed by Opera just like any other XML document. For an opinion on client side XSL-FO, see Formatting Objects Considered Harmful.<br />
<br />
3.3 XML namespaces<br />
<br />
Opera 6 supports XML namespaces. The most common use of namespaces is for XHTML processing. From Opera 4, the temporary HTML namespace (http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40) is recognized, from Opera 5.1 the XHTML namespace (http:// www.w3.org/1999/xhtml) is recognized too. <br />
<br />
3.4 XHTML support<br />
<br />
There are two &quot;modes&quot; of XHTML support, one where the document has the text/html content type and one where it is text/ xml, application/xml or application/xhtml+xml. In the first case the document is handles as any other HTML document (giving de facto support for XHTML 1.0, XHTML Basic and XHTML 1.1). In the second case XHTML will be treated as XML with predetermined functionality for HTML elements and attributes. In &quot;XML mode&quot; Opera has the following additional exceptions:<br />
<br />
base<br />
script and event handlers<br />
style (use the xml-stylesheet processing instruction instead) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
JavaScript environment: DOM and DHTML<br />
<br />
The following features are missing from JavaScript 1.3 support: <br />
<br />
the event variable passed to event handlers does not match the javascript standard <br />
cannot set the SRC attribute of iframes<br />
<br />
We are currently working on DOM, based on the DOM 2.0 standard. We have also used some of Microsoft's extensions to DOM, notably the method for accessing CSS properties through a style attribute of the HTML elements. Modifying the document structure is not yet possible (ie. you cannot add or remove HTML elements). There are no plans to support Netscape's dynamic layers. Presently, we support getting and setting the following CSS attributes for absolutely positioned HTML elements: <br />
<br />
visibility <br />
pixelLeft, pixelTop <br />
pixelWidth, pixelHeight <br />
zIndex <br />
color, background (only for setting of colors)<br />
<br />
We support the following methods in the document object: <br />
<br />
getElementsByTagName() <br />
getElementById() <br />
getElementsByName()<br />
<br />
We support the following methods in HTML Elements: <br />
<br />
getElementsByTagName() <br />
contains() <br />
parentNode<br />
<br />
6.1 Support for JavaScript and JScript objects<br />
<br />
Described in a separate document. Opera does not support W3C DOM Core apart from the methods mentioned above. Documentation on W3C DOM/HTML support is forthcoming. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Networking protocols support<br />
<br />
Opera 6 has full support for HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1. Here are some highlights: <br />
<br />
Persistent connections (multiple request/response through one connection), <br />
Cachecontrol for no-cache (always check for fresh document) and no-store (don't save to disk), <br />
Basic Authentication (passwords). Supports Digest Authentication, excepting integrity check on body. No current plans to support NTLM, <br />
Resume download, provided the server supports it, <br />
SSL/TLS support (also through proxy/firewall), <br />
Proxy for HTTP, FTP, Gopher and WAIS.<br />
<br />
Encryption: 128 bit encryption (RSA key exchange only) for the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) versions 2 and 3, and the successor Transport Layer Security (TLS) v1.0. This is supported for HTTP (web), NNTP (news), POP and SMTP (e-mail). Support for generating private keys and submitting certificate requests. <br />
<br />
News: simple online newsreader with support for encrypted newsservers and newsserver with passwords. Can decode single article attachments, MIME or uuencoded. <br />
<br />
FTP including resume download is supported. <br />
<br />
It is possible to download to file for both FTP and HTTP.  <br />
<br />
These are the most relevant things that might pertain to pages like some have mentioned.  For anyone interested, if you revela teh HTML Page Source Code (in any browser), and look at the part that is displayed funny, you can check to see if Opera supports that particular function, or if it is a non-standard or mis-implemented function.  Opera has a place on it's site for bug reports, and one for suggeste changes.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 13, 2002, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A new version of Opera came out today, 6.05.  Just download it ( www.opera.com ) , and install over your current version of 6.xx opera, and everything will be updated.  <br />
<br />
I also downloaded the newest Java from Sun  (Sun makes Java).  If you download the newest Java, it is version 1.4.01.  You should uninstall prior Java first (it is in Control Panel), then install the new Java.  The Java install will find and recognize Netscape and IE.  I thinke new Java is much better, esp. the Java Console and options, like setting the Java Cache location and size (I always put my caches on a special drive, where they don't fragment the OS's drives).<br />
<br />
To update (or install for the 1st time) Opera and Java 1.4, here are the steps:<br />
<br />
1.  Download Opera.  You don't need the Java version of Opera, if you are going to download the 1.4 version from Sun (See step 2).  That's because JRE 1.3 is included with Opera's Java version, and 1.3 is OK, but 1.4 just came out and I recommend you download it from Sun.  It  will help all your browsers and anything on yur system that uses Java, including Netscape and MS IE.<br />
<br />
2.  Download Java 1.4, All Languages, JRE ( here (http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html) ).  Choose only the &quot;all languages&quot; version:  it's the 2nd row, first column (the JRE column, not SDK).  Check the filesize as you download; it will be about 12 MB in size (English-only JRE is about 9MB).  <br />
<br />
Note:   JRE=Java Runtime Environment, which all modern 6.xx and higer browsers use; SDK= Developer's Kit.... you don't want THAT!<br />
<br />
3. Install Opera.  If you DL'd the java version of Opera 6.05, then just do not run the Java install when asked at the end of the Opera install (it would just install JRE 1.3, which you should then uninstall anyway).<br />
<br />
4.  Unistall existing Java, assuming you have it on your machine (99% of you do, already). (Control Panel --&gt;  Add/remove Programs, then select &quot;Java 2 Runtime ...&quot; or something very similar).<br />
<br />
5.  Run the Java All Languages JRE 1.4 Install you downloaded from Sun.<br />
<br />
6.  You can check Java by looking at the icon in Control Panel (double click to see/change settings like cache location).  You can check it from within Opera by using Window ---&gt; Special ---&gt; Java Console.  You can also use File --&gt; Preferences --&gt; MultiMedia ---&gt; Find Plugins, if yu want to see more info (and set Java settings from Multimedia).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
SKINS/BUTTONS<br />
<br />
I looked at the Skins thing which Smash was talking about earlier, and decided to try some.  The best 15 look like this:<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.com/uploads/Opera_Skins3.gif<br />
<br />
<br />
I took them, and made a separate directory to keep all of them separate in the \buttons directory of Opera.  With Preferences, you can switch fast!<br />
<br />
If you want all 15 fast, you need only download the file below, and unzip it (with path) into the Opera\Buttons directory.  Most would install to their own directory anyway (if you Download them individually), but some authors simply dumped all files into the \Buttons directory, and made a mess, :lol: .<br />
<br />
The file with the 15 new skins/buttons is 1.4 MB:<br />

...which is exactly why I use editPlus/IE instead. <br />
I don't understand ??? <br />
<br />
I assume your context is that because a browser does not implement some aspects of the White paper you don't use it?  MS IE does not.  Further, MS IE incorrectly and deliberately does not follow the M3C standards.  No browser engine (the thing that displays and renders pages) implements all white paper standards... the important thing, to ensure industry and cross platform standards, is to implement what you do use correctly.  This is what MS fails to do, in an effort to try and get developers to used the nonstandard stuff.  Netscape used to add it's own extensions, back in the early and mid 1990's, when the standards committees were behind the times.  Since about 1999, though, the industry has been doing fine... except mainly the MS stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, people should keep MS IE installed anyways, because MS has sabotaged windows help system if you ininstall it.  MS will not tell you how to get rid of IE, but some of us know how and actually do it on some OS installs.  It is not easy, in the newer OSs, though.  And many MS apps will not run if you give IE the axe, and even some 3rd party apps will not run.  This is the element of insurance MS has done with their illegal OS monopoly, to ensure people are chained to tow the MS line.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as Browsers go, I've found 3 sites out of over 400 so far that have display problems (cramming lots of table or pull down choices into a small or overlapping area) using Opera.  Netscape as difficulty with some sites, too, but some pages it is able to mimick Explorer and display similarly.  I've been running MS IE side by side at times, but won't risk it for too long, because MS IE has crashed the machine twice today, and of course that takes time because it usually damages the File structure on the hard drives when it crashed.<br />
<br />
So far, Opera has not crashed at all.  Yea!<br />

<br />
believe me, if I can do something anti-microsoft then I do. but using opera just goes past it. The reason I use IE/editPlus is not only because opera doesn't work properly for me but becuase the combination is so good.<br />
<br />
Opera has trouble displaying tables/layout...there are always troubles with this, no matter how you switch the stylesheet settings (which is a pretty cool option btw :D). Now the one thing that it seriously screws up on is phpBB. and the one thing that I spend most of my free time doing is phpBB...it's truly an eyesore. Next, it doesn't support chunks of css...css is my absolute most favourite thing ever, even better than php. I regularly use many of the things that it doesn't support.<br />
<br />
And yes, I know how MSIE doesn't support things properly...but if I use IE, then my page will display how people expect it to display. the fact still remains that 90%+ (just a guess) use IE, and that the majority of pages are tested/designed for IE and will thus work better on it.<br />
<br />
For a little user who doesn't care about fancy CSS, then yes, opera is the way to go...but for people like me, when I design stuff, if I test it in opera and it displays fine in that, who knows what it will look like in IE??<br />
<br />
I go with the majority, it's much simpler<br />
<br />
But that's not only why I use editplus and IE. It's because this combination is soooo perfect for me. I always found IE horendously (sp??) slow, but editplus is very fast. As I said before, I spend most of my time doing something with phpBB. I also generally have a lot (a lot being about 20+ :eek: ) of windows open usually. editplus stores all the browser windows inside itself like opera can.<br />
<br />
the other thing (related to phpBB) that I spend a lot of time doing is coding. That's what editplus is designed for. I can be surfing the web, coding something and viewing it locally, writing my homework and viewing a template in just one program. It works almost perfectly for me, it just suits me so well having the things that I spend my time on all neatly placed in one program instead of scattered across my screen in a dozen windows. It's like trillian in a way - instead of having multiple programs to do something, it has them all lumped into one for me.<br />
<br />
Most people wouldn't like it, but it suits me perfectly. :)</div></div><hr />

Opera is so much faster, and it doesn't screw up my music half as much while loading. :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 14, 2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As FBL has said, there are sites that Opera will not display too well, and ditto for Netscape.  For those, just use IE (or NS).  Unlike MS, Opera is far more apt to listen and act on user input.  Anyone should use the opportunity to tell Opera what you want, as they are always working on it. <br />
<br />
Opera is a much more &quot;secure&quot; browser than MS IE, for technical reasons.  That is, Opera is not as exploitable as IE.  For instance, the 6.05 upgrade is mainly in response two the new standards form 7 August, 2002 (last week).  <br />
<br />
Opera finally crashed today (a first).  However, the crash was caused by an ill-behaved MS program, LOL!  Opera simply terminated after it was violated, and when I restarted Opera, all the pages I was working on (over a dozen) were returned!!!  Wow!  Sooo cool.  And fast.</div></div><hr />

Another thing, as it comes to mind:<br />
<br />
I like Opera for the fact that when it crashes, it does not force me to reboot windows, as IE often did on my PC. <br />
<br />
What's cool is if Opera crashes it gives you the option to start where you left off next time you open it.<br />
<br />
I've been using Opera for a while now.  Probably for different reasons than you.  I just hate Microsoft.  I don't want to support them in any way and want my privacy to stay private.<br />
<br />
I dig the bookmarking.  IE always forces folders in the favorites. <br />

WOW, that's really yet another great feature!  I'll need to learn about that, too.  It looks like there are lots of things you can do with mouse gestures!!  There is so much cool stuff in Opera, that I have not tried a lot of it yet. <br />
<br />
Yep.  After a few days learning, I am a mouse gesture adept.  Not quite a black belt yet, but I've learned the back, forward, new window, refresh, new window (same as current window), and close window.<br />
<br />
Now I don't need the toolbar any more!  And I browse so much faster!  Fascinate your friends!<br />
<br />
Now, Opera is starting to crash a bit more often on me.  Not sure if it's because I'm can now browse at quadruple the speed as I used to in IE, but as said, any time it does, windows stays up and when re-opening, all the Opera windows that were up are restored.<br />
<br />
I started using it upon learning of it here at CFC, perhaps about a month ago.  Can't remember the thread then but it was in this forum somewhere...</div></div><hr />

6. Does it spout CSS well?<br />
7. Is it compatible with all the latest W3C compliances like IE 6? <br />
1. Yes.  Java is not Browser-Specific.  All users of all Browsers... everyone reading this... can (and generally should) run Java version 1.4.<br />
<br />
2.  As far as I can tell, just fine.  I control active X via AtGuard, though.<br />
<br />
3.  Bad code?  Well, some menus will have the typical misaligned look, or all the data choices of certain styles piled on top.  It does not crash, if that's what you mean.  In my prior posts, I posted the technical details from Opera about exactly what the engine does, it differences, and compliance.  <br />
<br />
4.  Never tried Hebrew... have a look at the Opera site.<br />
<br />
5.  Yes.<br />
<br />
6.  Yes.  No browser engine (the thing inside all browsers that actually formats and displays the page... in Netscape, the engine is Mozilla, for instance) implements all the CSS white paper features.  MS makes some of its own rules &amp; changes.  Programs like TopStyle work fine.  I have used and edited the CSS for CivFanatics, and it works fine with Opera.  Like anything, if a site does not work right with one browser, then use another one for that site.  I've found parts of 3 sites (out of about 400 that I personally use) that Opera does not display well.<br />
<br />
7.  IE6 is not compliant.  No browser engine in existance (that I know of) is.  MS makes its own rules, and has it's own &quot;interpretations&quot; of W3C, which is part of why other browsers do not display some MS-generated HTML, etc., the same as IE does.  MS is the &quot;big gorilla&quot;, and does not want anyone using non-MS products to either generate web pages, or browse (or even run OS, apps, etc, for that matter).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Run Opera if you want... the only thing I regret is not trying it for many years (I used it a little years ago).  No other browser, Netscape included, is a fast, stable, well-behaved, compact, and most definitely nowhere nearly as feature-laden as Opera.  Opera uses fewer CPU cycles and much fewer resources, too.<br />

One question:<br />
<br />
How do I get rid of pop ups? I have POW with all the things already intalled and working with IE and I made opera open in seperate windows but it still doesn't kill them.<br />
<br />
How do I make POW kill pop ups? Or does opera have an integrated pop up killer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
At times, I have run 4 browsers at the same time (MS IE, 2 Netscapes, and Opera) for comparison.  My ad killer (AtGuard) kills everything I want it to... it is not depended on the browser.  It looks directly at the incoming/outgoing data.  I have no idea how your ad killing software (POW?) works.  I don't think I've even heard of it before.<br />
<br />
If somone has no ad killing software, Opera does a passable job with ad annoyances, though.  But it is not ad killing software pe se.</div></div><hr />

I had originally downloaded Opera 5 on my old computer a long time ago for testing web page compatability.  (I design web pages)  I loved it, but it was a 30-day trial back then, so I didn't use it much.  I recently downloaded Mozilla when it came out for Windows (v1.0) to test compatability, and I loved Mozilla.  I completely switched from Internet Explorer to Mozilla.  Then I downloaded Opera 6..<br />
<br />
I've hardly used Mozilla since.. I love Opera so much..<br />
<br />
Opera is definately a program I would pay for (all it does for me is remove the banner ads built in to the browser.. and I don't mind banner ads at all.. but I really think Opera deserves it.  Now if only I had money =P)  Oh well =P<br />
<br />
The only thing I'm worried about.. when I go back to school in a few weeks I'll be the teacher aide for the computer teacher.. and while that means I'll probably be able to use the much superior Linux.. I'll probably have to use Internet Explorer (ICKH!!!!!  *Puke* *Hack* Gah!) when using Windows.. unless I can convine him to install Opera.. ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am very technical, and have programs tha monitor programs running at all times on my machines.  Chopiness probably means something is stealing CPU cycles, and that something is not Opera, which uses less than IE.  It may be antivirus, ad-busting stuff, firewall, spyware (a good possiblilty unless you know how to find it on your machine and remove it), using an Internal 14.4 thru 56K modem, MS Resource problems, and literally dozens of other things.<br />
<br />
One thing is guaranteed.  If there are problems like US and Daaraa describe, they are not defects with Opera... something else is going on, as I've put Opera thru the wringer for a week, including on low-end machines down to 400MHz.<br />
<br />
I suggest you use something simple like WinTop (a tiny program) if using Win9x/ME.  WinNTx (2K &amp; XP) have a built in process and load monitor in the ctrl-alt-del popup options.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Aug 19, 2002, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use IE 5.50, because that's what most clients use (at least last year).  But I have a friend who swears by Opera.  He's installed it on my machine, and it is a nice test browser.  I write simple reliable code, but often the old Netscape 4.08 won't render properly.  If IE 5.50 does and Opera does, I ignore Netscape.<br />
<br />
BTW, IE 5.50 can print reports with pagination properly, but the IE 6 a few months back wouldn't.  Interestingly, you had to code the opposite of the MicroSoft recommendations to make IE 6 print with correct pagination, so we agnored it and asked people, why did you upgrade from IE 5.5?  Someday, I'll need to resolve that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Opera is surely great --, if you don't need to live in the world with all of the people afflicted by MS code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 19, 2002, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Several very common reasons for jumping mice pointers are the number of cached icons (too many WILL start to cause it), or the Read Ahead buffer in MS's lousy Disk Cache.  I set mine to ZERO, since with IDE drives, if a simultaneous request for a disk read occurs, it will cause tiny &quot;pauses&quot; or &quot;jitters&quot;.  I tried it (deliberatly) today, and sure enough, it was there (Opera or not!)... its an OS issue.<br />
<br />
Also, the location and fragmentation of your Swap File can (will) cause it, under many circumstances.  MS cannot control it's own swapfile in defrag... which is typical of sloppy work by MS.  You need a good defrag program like Norton to do make your swapfile run well (called pagefile.sys in NTx).  I position my swapfile (and my pagefile for NTx) on the outer disk track (the absolute fastest location) with Norton.  MS in utterly incapable of doing this.  You also need to set your Swapfile to PERMANENT.  MS will not do this for you.  But you can force it, and MS will complain loudly and scare you with warnings if you try, but it is the right thing to do for performance.<br />
<br />
PageFile Call Async Manager can be disabled (MS enables it).  This stops the MS Memory Manager from asynchronsly writing out swap file buffers during VFAT idle times. This reduces Virtual Memory swapping, but should only be done if you have large amounts of free memory. <br />
<br />
<br />
There are dozens of other things, and most are technical, and only required because MS is so utterly bad at delivering a good OS to the consumer.  You almost need to be a rocket scientist just to get a MS operating system working anywhere near its best efficiency.  The average user has no chance setting up their OS in the most optimum way.  <br />
<br />
So it's just self-defense to learn about your OS, if you are stuck with MS.<br />
<br />
BTW, I use MS Win95 OSR 2.1, and do things with it the MS testifies in court are impossible, and therefore why they commit their crimes.     It is of the ultimate Irony that Win95 OSR 2.5 and 2.1, if you can tame the beast, is much faster than any MS GUI OS, except Win98xx .  Mine Win95 is more stable than most people running Win2K, and especially XP.<br />
<br />
However, Win95 does have certain limitations, since MS has included some things in DKs to developers that render some programs impossible to run in Win95... most notably for me is Photoshop 6.xx and 7.xx, which I use Win2K.<br />
<br />
No OS after Win95 can reboot as fast.  All MS OSs will crash, and more frequently for power users.  On this particular install of Win95, I've run it stable on an overclocked machine (e.g, hot chip) for over 2 years (not continiously, but without reinstallling it).  My registry is error-free (but about 8 MB with hundreds upon undreds of installed programs) and compact (no data holes).  But then I have had to learn lots more about the MS crap since all the government computers in our offices run it, LOL.  MS practically gives the software to us Gov't entities, since it forces lots of people to buy the real things to be compatible.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, for most people I'd just recommend Win98(SE) with all the updates.  There are dozens of updates.  Apply them, and do it in the right order, for best performance ;).  If your machine is running &quot;OK&quot;, don't run off and dowload stuff and install it, unless you know exactly why you are doing it, though.  :)</div></div><hr />

Yes and that doesn't seem to cure it.  However, for some reason, the right-click and &quot;save target &quot; seems to suddenly work today.  I know it didn't before.... weird...  The left click still messes up.  Thanks though.<br />

The reloading sometimes leaves my pages half-loaded too.  I did a few searches on the Opera forum, under &quot;looping&quot; or something like that and it was reported once, as far as I can find.

It opens 2 or 3 popups in the same window all in the backround so I'm never bothered with them. <br />
It's a lot faster than IE loading some pages, others pages are just slightly faster.<br />
Nice to see exactly what the browser is doing.. sending request, recieving data, etc.<br />
Having the browser crash and making the whole system unstable is something I won't miss.<br />
<br />
My only complaint is that you have to put the mouse cursor over the scrollbar to use the wheel. I've had no problems since I found the option to make it work. Don't remember what option it was, but when I first installed it just hung on every page.  heh<br />
<br />
[EDIT] Another thing I like is the java works! It's been over a year without my ie java working. I've spent so much time trying to fix it. Everything short of formatting. <br />

 Now Opera doesnt work at all. When I start it up, the screen opens and asks if I want to browse where I left off, but then locks up. So far, all other programs work OK. <br />
