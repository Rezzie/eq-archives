<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">May 15, 2003, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, thanks to everyone whose left messages me in various threads over the last couple of weeks. :D We had a lovely day, and we spent 4 days in Paris.<br />
<br />
Back on topic - here's a poll on a few issues. Self explanatory really. I think we should contact the Zulus and French. We know we are near them, but we don't want to run into one of thier boats before making contact because (in my past experience) they'll attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 15, 2003, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Which is the Zulu island and which is the aztec island? They might be the same:) <br />
<br />
I did meet a zulu trireme but instead of contacting them I moved the other direction.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure, but I think, when making contact after MPE, usually one will demand money and declare war when I don't give it to them. Anyone know more aobut this? Or at least have noticed it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 15, 2003, 10:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think the AI has a stronger tendency to demand $$ after you have built MPE unless you are weak, meaning you have few military units. This is the reason it may be a good idea to build 10-15 warriors soon. OTOH I have often demanded and received tribute (sometimes a total of several thousand gold over a few dozen turns) after building MPE, in fact MPE makes this easier because you have contact with every civ, know their attitude, how much $$ they have etc.<br />
<br />
The funniest sequence of events that can happen is this (the numbers are arbitrary turn numbers):<br />
<br />
(1) Demand tribute =&gt; you get some gold<br />
(2) Demand tribute =&gt; war<br />
(3) Contact AI civ, it offers a cease fire. You refuse, get offered $$ for it and say yes. Then you refuse a peace treaty, get offered $$ and only then sign the treaty.<br />
(4) Demand tribute =&gt; war<br />
(5) See (3) !<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
Sometimes more than one turn passes between the above events. Needless to say this can also happen when you don't have MPE.<br />
<br />
Why earn money yourself when you can let others do it for you ? :D.</div></div><hr />
