It's just a trial version but should serve your purposes :)</div></div><hr />

Sure is annoying when I have to download a 'free' 5-day RealPlayer trial, only for it to be gone a week later, then I can't listen to the music. :mad:<br />

<br />
RealPlayer Files can't be burnt, and that is my main problem.<br />
<br />
I have a new problem: all the shareware mp3 Converters I found only let you record/convert one minute of music.  That  really sucks, because most songs are more than one minute.  Anyone know where I can get a conveter that is FREE, won't ask me to buy every five seconds, and lets me record more than 60 seconds of sound??? :mad:<br />
<br />
I'll try changing the extension, spycatcher.<br />

<br />
As to the converter...man, there doesn't seem to a be a free one out there! Bummer. How did you get the music in real format to begin with? If you ripped the songs yourself I would recommend ripping them again but this time put them in OGG format (tis better than MP3 IMHO).</div></div><hr />

All to MP3 converter works fine for me. Maybe the newer version(s) wont convert more than a min for free but mine does..I've converted several songs w/it.</div></div><hr />

Name please?  I had to burn a CD where every song is broken into one minute chunks...very annoying, feels like I'm playing a CD on an old walkman, with lots of skipping.  :cry:<br />

<br />
Get a plugin called &quot;Tara&quot; for Winamp 2. This reads in real audio into winamp. Go to Winamp preferences, output and click disk writer. Click play and the file is converted from RA to wav. Encode wav to mp3 using Easy Audio Copy.</div></div><hr />

That's the name :)</div></div><hr />
