<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2003, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a record of the opening stages of our first war. <br />
<br />
In 450BC Cleopatra the despotic ruler of the Egyptians declared war on our beautiful nation. After we refused her unreasonable demands she vowed to destroy our cities and kill our citizens. <br />
<br />
Fear gripped the nation. Our legions were few and scattered. However the resolve of the people is strong and their will unbreakable. The cities called on all able bodied men to enlist in the legions. Men flocked to the cities to enlist. Weapons were crafted and the sound of hammer on anvil could be heard throughout the land. Our roving bands of warriors returned to Aureus, our eastern capital, to equip and train with the new weapons. <br />
<br />
Outside Aureus the first of the Egyptians advanced. They struck against us but were defeated by the brave warriors from Noshuret. Our soldiers were now ready to strike back. Plans were made to capture El-Amarna and Byblos. However before we could launch our attack disaster befell us. Settlers from Noshuret became separated from their escort and ran into a band of Egyptian soldiers patrolling south of El-Amarna……….</div></div><hr />
