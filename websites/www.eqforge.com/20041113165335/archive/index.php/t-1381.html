<br />
Well, it depends your liking, you can make historical or fictional ones. And objetives or empire building ones.<br />
(Personally I prefer historical) <br />
if you like historical, you can do of your favourite age and country, you can make one about a war or about the develop of a country a discover or something like this.<br />
If it is fictional, you can make about space, old mitology, Lord of the rings theme or everything you want http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
Talk about your taste and we make more suggestions.</div></div><hr />

Is there a scenario about Lord of the Rings?<br />
Old mythology...<br />
...sounds good, maybe I should do someting like that.<br />
I don't think I'll make something with a war, I'll think about the development of a country or a discovery.<br />
How should I make a scenario about Alice in Wonderland?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2001, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">'Alice' would have to be a series of quests like Oddesy but you could twist the storyline to you liking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2001, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing: you asked me to 'teach' you, and I said I would tell you which files could/should be edited and how. From that point, you just have to 'explore'. I think your first scenario should be a 'small' one, not too complex. <br />

<br />
By the way, you have a major problem - cause no war = great complexity.<br />
<br />
The best way to make your scenario easy is to make up a story yourself. That way, you won't have to create any sounds or graphics. Just 'steal' units and other stuff from everywhere and cobble it together. It would be easiest to get ready made 'parts' for a fantasy type scenario and quite fun.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />

http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif Of course there has to be war in a civ-scenario, I just meant no World War or war that really took place.</div></div><hr />

You know, the one I showed you, about 'Onzinland'. We could use the ToT units and sounds. What about it? I'll do the really hard stuff and explain it to you.<br />

There're interesting stuffs on this world and the quest of Stormbringer is complex enough to make a good scenario. Or even Warhammer but its background is poor (only battles and battles... Especially War 40000)<br />
<br />
Or you can also have something about sci-fi? Star Wars, Blade Runner?<br />
