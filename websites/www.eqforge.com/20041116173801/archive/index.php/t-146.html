<br />
wtf is a succession game?<br />
<br />
A game that is passed from player to player.Playing a set amount of turns..say 10.Each successive leader runs our civ as he/she sees fit,saves and sends it on to the next player and so on.<br />
<br />
I propose a large random world,deity, raging hoardes,no restart for eliminated civs.Possibly flat map.Open for discussion.<br />
<br />
We do it at Apolyton and it is great fun, so check civ2/general for examples if you like.It is challenging as the previous leader may have ruled in a completely different style than you are accustomed to and you want to do as well as you can on your turns.At least not hurt the civ too bad http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
10 players should be the limit per game.I can play either 2.42 or MGE.We won't mix and match though.Seperate games can be started if needed.<br />
<br />
To start it may be 15 turns first time thru,then 10 in subsequent turns.Open for discussion.<br />
<br />
You need Civ2(duh),an e-mail than can accept attachments, and a compression utility like zip.<br />
<br />
So if you're game,post here with your version and ANY game setting suggestions.We'll gather e-mail addresses later.<br />
<br />
You will be expected to post some kind of account of each set of turns you play.Creativity encouraged but not required.<br />
<br />
mac vs pc compatibilty is NOT a problem.</div></div><hr />

This could be a cool thing, that way we can see if other players agree with our own choices!!! Even if 15/10 turns really isn't much time to make a real impact!!<br />

<br />
It'll go by fairly quick and you only have to play short sessions at each reign you have.The biggest slower downer is when someone is MIA for awhile.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that the first 3 players play 15 turns each.There isn't too much happening at that stage.Then go to 10 turns.Later as the civ grows we may want to cut back to 5 turns.Beleive me...you will ask yourself &quot; is that 15 turns allready?&quot; http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

either random map or custom if anyone knows of an interesting map to play on.<br />

Hakan-you are going to start the game yes?Looks like emperor will be a happy medium.<br />
please send 4000bc save to Smash007@altavista.com<br />
We'll start ASAP and follow the order above.<br />
<br />
<br />
The saved game will be sent to you by the previous player.MGE players-I will act as gamemaster for the MGE game so send a copy of your save to me in addition to the next player.<br />
<br />
If we don't hear from a player for a reasonable period,we will skip that player and proceed to the next in line.Hopefully it will progress well.<br />
<br />
zipping-1st you need to download something like zip-it.You can find them at download.com under compression utility.They are free.If you want to register and send money thats up to you http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
receiving file-you drag and drop the zip file on your zip utility after 'getting attachments&quot; from the e-mail .It decompresses.You put in civ2 files and &quot;load saved game&quot;.PC players may need to rename the save to xxxxx.sav-PC version needs the ext .sav-no such problem with mac.<br />
<br />
sending file-you drag nd drop your sav on the utility.It should compress to xxx.zip.Attach this to an e-mail and press &quot;send&quot; http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

There should be a whole new forum for this thing (Thunderfall?). We could do the same thing for scenarios, too. <br />

We don't need a separate forum for succession games. You can just create some threads in either the civ2 multiplayer or civ2 general forum... One long thread is usually enough for a succesion game. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />

I know my version has no multi-player capabilities. My concern was that it still wasn't &quot;classic&quot;. Although I expect I'll be able to load up the game someone else save (like GOTM), it would be no good if no one could load the game I saved.<br />
<br />
(My reticence came from trying to download the saved games from the Hall of Fame and succeeding with most but not being able to download Shadowdale's because of some version mismatch.)<br />

If we are going to use the same game for both teams, then we may not want to have someone playing both games (sorry Cedric).  It would just seem that, in the beginning especially, the person that plays on both will have an unfair advantage.  One team may open up one side of the map, and the other team could go an entirely different direction.  The player on both teams would then have knowledge of the map that he/she shouldn't.<br />

Hey this does seem to make some sense, prolly (damn aol slang sneaking in) why Håkan said no earlier. I don't mind only being on one &quot;team&quot; but I do think this has a bit of competition coming up between the &quot;classics&quot; and the &quot;MGE's&quot; and I find it funny, remember it's just a &lt;u&gt;game&lt;/u&gt; &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/tongue.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flatlander Fox</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2001, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just got finished with my first reign in the classic game.  I'm wondering this...  Are we able to keep the timelines that each player wrote and put them together into a &quot;Civ&quot; story.  I think that it would be pretty neat to have a history of these succession games down in print.  The storyline I got from Thunderfall was pretty good and I hope that I did it justice when I sent my lines to Cedric.  I like the idea that we each have an impact on this one game, and for better or worse we all get stuck with it.  It can't be that much work to get all the timelines together and then cut and paste it all into one big story with the dates.  It would maybe top five or six pages of printed material and you would have a record of these games for all to see!  It would help some newer players to read what exactly some more experienced players did, turn by turn.  This way, history really could judge you.  If the town you built in 600 b.c. really ended up a dud, there is a written record of it, &quot;signed&quot; by you!!!  Or if you did something heroic, we can sing your praises in the halls of the CivFanatics Forum!!!<br />

  I'm going on vacation, so if its late the people after me will have to wait for a week.<br />
<br />
Once again, I don't know how long these things will take, and if its sent to me around next week and I don't quickly send it, I haven't bailed, I'm just out of the country. <br />

&quot;failed to load.Not a saved game&quot;&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/shakehead_ron.gif&quot; border=0&gt;.So.. you can load 2.42 but 2.42 cant load 2.78.And 2.78 can't load MGE &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/confused.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />

doesn't look good.<br />
<br />
Alright Andu Indorin just let me know that the sav I just sent him &quot;failed to load&quot; so I checked my version and guess what its ver. 2.7.8l, I went and dled the version 2.42 patch and couldn't open any of my sav's but could still open the original sav so it looks like I'll have to replay my turns when I get out of work. I believe version 2.7.8l means we have Fantastic Worlds installed, as I do and the version on my classic civ cd is 2.42. If this doesn't work I'll just forward the first zip.<br />

<br />
You can have as many or few players as you like.There are no rules.Just the more players there are,the more chances for delays.<br />
<br />
One group at Poly plays 5 turns and you have 72 hours to play or they skip you for example.Another is an OCC game.A no ICS game.An OCC bloodlust game.<br />
<br />
This type of game is more enjoyable than a regular game for some reason.Recently,I had 3 different succession games show up at the same time.That was heaven for me.</div></div><hr />
