The following is a list of the generic build queue improvements that are still not complete. Some terrain improvement issues are also mentioned.<br />
<br />
Doughnutia: Stockpile caravans. Transform plains to grassland<br />
Barbarians Suck: Needs CH, SE, SM. Chop down some trees<br />
Point Blissful: Needs CH, SE, SM<br />
Lucy's Crossing: Stockpile caravans. Chop down some trees once we have farmland where possible ? Sell barracks ?<br />
Regia Fanatica: Could easily support 2 or 3 more engineers. Then stockpile caravans.<br />
Neumatic: Needs CH, SE, SM. Irrigate forest squares.<br />
Mount Leo: Work ocean instead of desert, maximize food. Needs caravans ASAP that will be delivered in Dou.<br />
Lunatic Pandora: Stockpile caravans. Irrigate forest.<br />
EnchantedForest: Needs SM (rush buy next turn !!), then stockpile caravans.<br />
Igloria: Needs LIB (rush buy now !!), CH, SE, SM<br />
Funxus' Way: Needs CH, SE, SM<br />
Naervana: Needs SE, SM.<br />
Ipecacuanha: Needs LIB, SE, SM. Irrigate forest. One engineer should be rehomed in Africa where it is currently located. Sell barracks ?<br />
Viking Mine: Needs SM (rush buy !). Alpine troops hardly necessary. Eliminate Elvis. Start stockpiling caravans ASAP. Mine the gold ?<br />
<br />
I suggest we try speeding things up by rush buying an improvement every other turn in cities that need more than 2 improvements. This costs $$ but stockpiled $$ is of limited use. The goal would be to finish everything roughly 5 turns from now. Also caravans should be rushed, once we restart science it would be nice to have 20-30 commodity caravans. Where commodity caravans cannot be built build food caravans for wonders, several wonders will become available shortly after we restart science (WS and CFC in particular).<br />
<br />
Once we have celebrated for a few turns we will need colosseums in some of the Coresux cities. These cost lots of $$.<br />
<br />
The turn before we restart science (sometime after we have celebrated) we should buy universities in every Coresux city.<br />
<br />
I think we should start celebrating (meaning a switch to democracy) once all of the Coresux city have one or fewer of the above improvements left to build. Until then we should stay in fundamentalism and continue the wars. Since in fundamentalism courthouses are almost useless and we are not doing any science the improvement order should in general be SE, SM, CH, LIB. This means a revolution 3-6 turns from now.<br />
<br />
One question: Should we sell some of our barracks ?<br />
<br />
Commets and criticism wanted.</div></div><hr />
