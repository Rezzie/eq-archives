He understands the mysteries of Science, the nature of cities and serfs, the dramatic concept of Monarchy, and the interrelationship of the various Wonders on Science.<br />
<br />
Now it could be some of the other candidates understand these factors as well.  Please let us know!</div></div><hr />

How can I vote for someone that does not show enough enthusiasm for his potential post! :undecide:</div></div><hr />

You can believe in the high potential of Leowind : he was one of the most active citizen and advisor in the last DG.<br />
He has all the experience we need in this begining...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">puglover</div><div class="date">Mar 01, 2003, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vote for puglover!<br />
<br />
I've never been in a Demo Game before and want so government experience. I know the best techs. I promise I'll do my job well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Mar 03, 2003, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Science Advisor Candidate Leowind finally returns from his mysterious weekend junket to that unknown land he calls &quot;Southern Oregon&quot; to release a statement to the press.  Given the fact that no technologies whatsoever have been discovered, or even begun to be researched, that statement consisted of a big club upside the heads of his competitors :hammer: &quot;Ugh,.....uh.....vote for me...., yeah, that's it :) &quot;<br />
<br />
I have served as Science Advisor in the past demo game, and would willingly serve again, but best of luck to puglover and EnriqueCR, two newbies who deserve our support :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnriqueCR</div><div class="date">Mar 03, 2003, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi: thanks for your support.<br />
I큞l try to do it the best possible if I win.<br />
I know this is a very important factor of the game, so I will manage properly.<br />
If you choose me, i tell you i큞l campaign  for a library in each city, amd then universities. And i큞l try the taxes for this are high.<br />
This is my proposal.<br />
Vote me!!<br />
I큞l support the winner if i loose and if he wants, of course</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Mar 04, 2003, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&lt;bump&gt;<br />
Tight race here, folks.  And 6 fewer total votes than the presidential election poll.  I know I'm one of them (I&quot;m abstaining due to conflict of interest :D ), but that means five of you have not voted on your Science Advisor.  This one could go either way at the moment, so your vote does count!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Mar 04, 2003, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the conflict?  It's ok to vote for yourself, isn't it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Mar 04, 2003, 06:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go Leowind!  He was an excellent former Science Advisor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Mar 04, 2003, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Too many libraries cuts into Caravan &amp; Settler production. <br />
<br />
Or am I starting too early on this :lol: ?<br />
<br />
Octavian, I agree.  Leowind submitted our choices to a fair vote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Mar 05, 2003, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Originally posted by TimTheEnchanter <br />
What's the conflict?  It's ok to vote for yourself, isn't it? Yes, and normally I would.  I want to give the new folks a chance, though, so I'm abstaining from this vote.<br />
<br />
And thanks for the kind words, GN and Octavian :blush:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Mar 08, 2003, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This poll has been closed, so I assume results are final.  That being the case, I would like to congratulate Puglover for a great showing for a first time demo game player.  I would be honored and very appreciative if you would consent to being my deputy Science Advisor.  Keep posting your opinions and establish a presence in the demo game forum and you'll have a great shot at a government position next round.  <br />
<br />
EnriqueCR, Hats off to you for jumping right into the fray in the first round as well.  It is difficult for newbies to garner votes, but if you keep posting and show us that you're a regular poster and contributor, you'll do much better in the future as well.  Here's my good wishes for your next election try :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />
