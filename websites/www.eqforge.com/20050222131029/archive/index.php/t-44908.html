<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Feb 18, 2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I PMed Duke o'York and Kev, two previously very involved players, to let them know we were talking about a new game.  I don't know DoY's status; he left because of job change and computer access, so he may not be around :(.  If anyone knows anybody who might be interested in the next game, now would probably be a good time to get them invited.<br />
<br />
Now a question, how do I put a link to the game 3 subforum in my sig?  Can anyone help or point me to where the instructions might be?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, business and family have kept me busy enough to miss out on a lot here, but I'm going to try to be by more.<br />
<br />
Looks like all is going well with the DGII.  Nice job to all.  I'll have to read up on the ideas for DGIII and see what's what.</div></div><hr />

This is a perfect time to join, as we're just setting up a new game.  Check out the sticky threads in the Civ 2 Demo game 2 forum to get an idea what the demo game is like and how it's played, then by all means post your ideas, opinions, and vote in the polls here as we get the new game started. :)</div></div><hr />

So should i reply to the 'National Registry - The New World' thread in the Demo game II forum? or will there be a new thread in the Demo game III forum?<br />
Since as i read, not everybody who first signed in there participates anymore..</div></div><hr />
