<br />
First turn in Republic:goodjob:  And we have Mike's.<br />
<br />
Things to consider:<br />
<br />
What should we set the taxrate to?<br />
<br />
Which units shall we keep? Which units shall we disband?<br />
<br />
Where shall we deliver Dou caravan? I was far from sure which delivery we should have taken. Hides we could have delivered close. But VM would have given higher trade-off and the city has a lot of trade with the silk and gold.<br />
<br />
What to build next in a few cities? Switch to something?<br />
<br />
What to do with the triremes?<br />
<br />
Shall we found some more cities?<br />
<br />
Where to station our units for maximum protection?<br />
<br />
What plan for celebrations should we have? We might need improvements?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 25, 2003, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We should probably set science to 0% and luxuries to 50%. This is enough to start all cities celebrating but it will run out of steam very soon because city improvements and trade routes are needed (I doubt we'd grow most of our cities by more than 1 or 2). Then set taxes to maximum for 2-5 turns and then start celebrating, rush buying stuff on an as needed basis, we'll need several harbors, temples, marketplaces and maybe courthouses in the east. I'd like to get all cities currently of size 3 or bigger to size 8 or more within 10 turns from now.<br />
<br />
We need to reorganize the military, disbanding some units and probably rehoming others.<br />
<br />
We should probably deliver the Dou caravan in RF, I want trade routes in Dou ASAP and this also makes it easier for RF to celebrate. In addition, an interesting option is to send the about to be completed caravans in RF and PB to Dou to establish trade routes. Then Dou will have 3 trade routes and can start building caravans to send abroad.<br />
<br />
We probably should switch to improvements in all cities of size 3 and bigger, rush buying caravans where they are close to finished (e.g. RF and PB) and accepting the shield loss elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Doughnutia needs to start an aqueduct ASAP since 4 turns from now its size will exceed 8.<br />
<br />
We should aim to found new cities but probably not until WLTP is finished.<br />
<br />
The trireme NW of RF should maybe head for BS to explore the area there. It can also pick up BS' dip.</div></div><hr />

Then Dou will have 3 trade routes and can start building caravans to send abroad.   Question: When delivering to a city that has open trade routes, doesn't it often tie up the supply goods of the receiving city?  I.e. won't delivering to Dough will block the supply there, meaning we wouldn't be able to build the vans for foreign delivery?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 26, 2003, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure, but it sounds familiar.<br />
<br />
I'll play next on wednesday.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 26, 2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IIRC it only temporarily ties up Dou's supply goods. I plan to experiment with this in another game later today. Also importantly, Dou will not have much time in the near future to build caravans. It will soon again be very busy building improvements and wonders: Aqueduct, University, Isaac Newton's College, Bank and I want Shakespeare there as well despite the poll result - I think we can get it and all the other wonders as well since they are farther away in the tech tree.<br />
<br />
BTW I'm starting to change my mind about the Dou caravan, I think that IF we decide to deliver the RF and PB caravans in Dou then Dou's caravan should possibly be sent to Athens or Teno.</div></div><hr />

Sure, now that we built another trireme in Igl instead of a settler, we'll have at least one trireme to spare for that. I think Athens is the best choice, then Paris and then Ten (smallest and probably least trade).:)</div></div><hr />

It will soon again be very busy building improvements and wonders: Aqueduct, University, Isaac Newton's College, Bank and I want Shakespeare there as well If we deliver the caravans far overseas to cities that demand the goods (instead of delivering domestically), we can probably get enough gold bonus to buy those improvements rather than spending turns (that could be spent building more caravans) building them!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The OSR strongly opposes any move to set our science rate to 0%  We understand the need to temporarily adjust tax rates for the maximum good of the nation, but completely halting science even for a few turns is unacceptable to the OSR.  Please maintain at least 10%--more if possible--to keep our science moving.<br />
<br />
Switching hats--citizen Leowind now speaking:  Send the Doug caravan overseas.  Is there no guard in BP?  A city on a foreign continent, and also close to the Greeks homeland, needs a strong defense ASAP.<br />
<br />
We received Seafaring in a tech trade, but discovered none ourselves?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 28, 2003, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, there's no guard in BP or FJ, they're being built. I agree it's not that good to leave them undefended, but it's only for a few turns. BP is not on greek soil, but on the Aztec/Zulu continent, and very far out on the peninsula.<br />
<br />
We didn't discover anything last game, because we only played a five turns, of which one was in anarchy. University is soon discovered though.:)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Start playing now.</div></div><hr />
