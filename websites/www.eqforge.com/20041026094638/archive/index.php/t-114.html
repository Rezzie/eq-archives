I feel that any civ after civ1 (including civ3) is a derivitive of the original.  Yes civ2 and the like are different from the original, but how different are they?  You add a government here and there and some units and a little better graphics and walla, you have a new version of the same game.  Now, Im not saying that is bad, Im simply stating that civ2 is not that much different from the original.  Oh tell me the ways Im wrong.<br />

SMAC is the civilization idea tweaked and CTP is Civ turned to crap. But Civ II is and should be an evolved version of Civ <br />

As better tech is discovered, the games are (hopefully) improved. I hope that civ-3 is familiar, but with more features and better graphics.<br />

Firaxis should start reading our posts, and make better diplomacy and AI.<br />
<br />
The diplomacy sucks cause:<br />
AI gets an advantage-can make multiple demands, can declare war at will, and can form alliances so easily<br />
<br />
AI sucks cause:<br />
well, you know<br />
<br />
The goal for CivIII to aim at is decent AI and diplomacy!</div></div><hr />
