<br />
Okay, I'm about to nuke the enemy's capital. I'm maneuvering my nuke around, and on its 5th move, I accidentally move it into an airfield. Suddenly, my nuke cannot be moved anymore. I am forced to leave it there until the next turn. Since I cannot get any units into the airbase at the time, my nuke is destroyed easily by the enemy.<br />
<br />
Now, you can exploit this technique to your needs:<br />
<br />
Build airbases around your cities and do NOT put units in them. If your enemy wants to nuke you, he'll have to move them into the air bases, where you can easily pick them off.</div></div><hr />

Engineers can build them in one turn, so if you have no use for air units, build them on every tile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ai does know how to get thru &quot;poor man's SDI&quot; by pillaging but isn't too hard to stop.<br />
<br />
Several overlapping cities can be protected by 1 SDI.Protects everything within 3 squares of city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gatomarado</div><div class="date">Apr 19, 2001, 08:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's not a good strategy!<br />
<br />
If you do that you can't take your air units out of your cities and an AI unit can plunder your airbase and then nuke your city.<br />
<br />
The best way is to have two cities close. In one you build an SDI and in the other you don'd build the SDI (the second citie must within 3 squares of the first one). As the AI knows the cities who have SDIs they'll send nukes to the second citie several times but they won't destroy the city because it's protected by the first one!!<br />
<br />
Their nuclear arsenal is spent and you don't lose units! <br />

<br />
*and it does work very very well if you have a bunch of engineers.<br />

<br />
How much easier can it get?????<br />
I really have no idea why you guys make such a fuss about this, I never let the AI get nukes. I reduce them to pre-stoneware Civs long before that.<br />

When you don't start conquering untill you get artillery and cavaly its kinda hard to take over the world before nukes come along.<br />

<br />
But it's not the strategy of a powerful civ! To win you must have an airforce, and by building A/B everywhere you can't. After all the AI nukes only the cities that are full of units so if you keep a city free of A/B and station all your air units there, you can be sure that this will be the place he'll nuke... http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />

I don't know HOW many nukes of mine ( played Soviet ) got stuck in those damned airbases around Paris. I didn't check that closely and suddenly I realize not one of my nukes are blowing up anything... Luckily I conquered said anyways, so the nukes weren't destroyed, mostly...</div></div><hr />

It's not as if most people can't afford the SDI defenses, but it never hurts to save money now does it? It's actually pretty amusing, I noticed the computer tends to nuke his own missiles with that defense idea, since a couple tend to get caught in the &quot;web&quot; just outside the city...</div></div><hr />
