<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunderfall</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2002, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we should have big, nice award medals and trophies with the winners' names engraved on the surface. That way winners can proudly display their medals and trophies on their homepage if they have one. :)<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2002, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great idea! :cool:<br />
<br />
I'm not much of a drawer myself :(, but perhaps someone else could make some trophy or something? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me neither. :) Someone good with graphics can make a medal/trophy and save it in Photoshop format, then Matrix can just edit the file to add the winners' name along with the GOTm # to it each month and mail it to the winner. A bit more work for Matrix... ;)<br />
<br />
Certificate of achievement may be nice too... Here is a little sample I just made using a certificate template:<br />
<br />

<br />
Matrix can put his little signature image in that signature field to sign it. :cool:<br />
<br />
PS: We prolly can ask MMX to make the medals/trophies. MMX is very good with graphics.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/~matrix/GOTMCertificate.jpg<br />
<br />
Believe me, you don't want my real signature on it! :lol:<br />
<br />
Do you use a program for that, TF? If so, can I have it? Then I can make more of 'em, perhaps for everyone on request. :D After all, it's a certificate; not an award.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunderfall</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2002, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use PhotoImpact. :)  You can download it on download.com and other places you know... ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, in any case, if anyone is interested in getting such a certificate, all you need to do is ask. ;) I've made them for myself already.<br />

Place eighty-forth in CivFanatics' Game<br />
of the Month I for Civilization III<br />

Thank you!! Now all I need is a website to put it on :) There's a place I am going to try... (Otherwise, I can at least print it. :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldasar</div><div class="date">Apr 11, 2002, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah... I want one... For my excellent (NOT) placement in GOTM V ... 81st i think.... Not sure... :) It looks real neat...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Apr 14, 2002, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool idea.  Many of us probably aren't responding becasue we're no where near to getting an award.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's nice to have a GOTM this month that even us mortals can win.  (Mind you I mean win as in beat the AI, not as in get an award.)  I haven't won a GOTM since the histograph victory I got when we played the Persians in GOTM I!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've already sent Caldasar his (actually he can download it). Just look here... (http://www.civfanatics.net/~matrix/gotm/GOTM05Caldasar.jpg)</div></div><hr />

Look at it this way - you're in the top 100 in the world.  That's how I look at my scores.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />
