<br />
Kazaa has caused an error in MSHTML.<br />
<br />
What does it mean? How do I stop it from crashing?</div></div><hr />

Don't know why but if i restart Kazza it usuall works OK. Just don't use the Kazaa Media Player, I think its a bit unstable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jul 28, 2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">redtom, are you using Kazaa from Kazaa.com? If so, I suggest using Kazaa lite: www.kazaalite.com . It gets rid of the annoying psyware that Kazaa has but still allows for it to popup ads (a little annoying, but it is a free program).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it doesn't get rid of the Kazaa spyware, it just doesn't install it.  If you've already got the Kazaa spyware on your computer, you'll have to manually remove it.</div></div><hr />

Got IM, Blue? If so add me so we can chat someday. :)</div></div><hr />

In a few years spyware will forever be replaced by software that can read your every thought and will transmit it to the &quot;Riddler.&quot;  That is, of course, untill lowly BlueMonday turns himself into BatMan.<br />
<br />
You know, I've always meant to go get myself on an IM, but never got around to it.  Which is your huckleberry?</div></div><hr />
