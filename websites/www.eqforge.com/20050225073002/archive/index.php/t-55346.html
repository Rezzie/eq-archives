We need lots of caravans to build wonders and get trade routes and also settlers to expand and improve the terrain. However, some cities are building improvements. They should IMO finish them, except for Naervana where the shield loss form switching to a caravan is negligible. In general I recommend prioritizing the caravans ahead of settlers. We will rush buy a lot of them when we get a delivery bonus next.<br />
<br />
Building caravans in Dou is highly beneficial because of the big delivery bonuses. I'm recommending buying a caravan there now so it can board the trireme currently near the Aztecs ASAP. We are not in nearly as great a hurry to build Dou's next caravan since no trireme is ready to ferry it somewhere.<br />
<br />
Viking Mine has some unhappiness problems so I'm recommending a temple there now.</div></div><hr />

This will work well with Tims plan IMO.:)</div></div><hr />
