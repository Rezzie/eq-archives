Voting in our most recent Science poll has unequivecally declared Astronomy AND Monotheism as our priority science goal.  Monotheism refuses to share the top spot, declaring &quot;there should only be ONE supreme being,&quot; so we are holding a run-off election to declare for sure our one and only top science priority.  <br />
<br />
Will Monotheism's bid for supreme uniqueness win out, or will Astronomy's lofty visions come true?  That will be up to you.  Vote for one and one only.<br />
<br />
Loser in this election will be our second choice, with Republic our third, as voting in the 300BC Science poll stands as of the publication of this poll.</div></div><hr />

It seems we're already planning more for Cop's anyway, with the caravans already stored in Dou, or maybe it's just me planning for that.:) <br />
In retrospect I probably should have asked about where to store the caravans in a poll but stockpiling them in Dou looks like the best option (possibly also in Neu once we have lots of them). So if noone objects to this I think we should continue stockpiling them in Dou.</div></div><hr />

Getting back to the tech's, I think that we should get Cop's ASAP so I obviously voted Astronomy.</div></div><hr />
