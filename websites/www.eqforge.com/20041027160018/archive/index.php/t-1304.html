Keep in mind that with a modpack, you can generate a map or import your own...with a scenario, you kind of have to play the story...but you get more submersion in the theme or storyline...<br />

<br />
Personnaly i mostly love MODPACKS, but i like SCENARIO too. Currently, my faboulous CIV 1 MODPACKS goes like my best creation EVER WAS. So i'm stay mmmm, so when i'm done with it, i will try to send it. But something i think who will be tough it's because the MODPACK sound to be so very BIG! So, yes, for me, MODPACKS is better, but SCENARIO still very impressive!<br />

With mod packs and MGE, it means changing files on my harddrive, and it's a pain. With a scenario, you make a folder once, and you load it whenever you want, without thinking about files. I know you can do more with a mod-pack, but I'm a lazy ol' guy. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2001, 09:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, on a peripheral note...there are also some of those creations that don't really fall into either category...such as Steve Strayers Fascist Patch or the Hi-Res Patch by Tim F. Smith. Neither of these patches would really be incompatible with most mods or scenarios, yet people call them mods...you might call them an upgrade...<br />
<br />
Every once in a while you see a thread here with reference to &quot;Greater Civilizations&quot; a mod I created that doesn't really fit any category...<br />
<br />
I definitely think Circee and CornMaster are right...it really does seem as if the boundaries between scenario and modpack are starting to get rather gray...but also remember as AoA pointed out...Modpacks don't really work on MGE...so you really are forced to make a choice between the two or find some way to make a modpack work on MGE...such as saving a start game or start scenario in a folder with the mod...<br />
<br />
hmmm...this thread has turned up more ideas than I expected...<br />
<br />
What else is out there?<br />

Everyone calls them scenarios, but they're just modpacks with a scenasrio in it. I like those the best: You have a nice scenario and you can use the edited stuff for a &quot;new game&quot;. I think most classic users prefer modpacks, because there aren't any events in the classic scenarios.<br />

<br />
willemvanoranje, that is one thing that might really make the difference as to why Classic Civ II players would prefer mods...<br />
<br />
...even if a scenario might be good with the events, the absence of events makes it dull for a lot of players perhaps...<br />
<br />
...playing other scenarios with a lot of file changes like a modpack is definitely an option I had not considered...in that case, even scenarios for MGE would have files that could be used by a Classic Civ II player as a modpack...<br />

The reason is that I want the best i can get. In the classic cenarios you can't change anything! You must have the same units and grafics. I use tha Modpack Manager and that way I don't need to change the files permanently. I can easy switch between modpacks and the original grafics and stuff.<br />

<br />
The modpack manager is one of the greatest free inventions available to mankind for civing. I do believe that you can copy most of the files for scenarios of FW and MGE to your modpack manager and use it as a modpack...<br />
<br />
Also, here is another thing to think about...there are also some some scenarios out there that simply wouldn't make sense to be modpacks...such as scenarios that mirror a specific story...or graphic display...Eyn's &quot;Mafia&quot; scenario is a good one, but if you load it up as a modpack...you can't generate a map...you would have to play the map from the scenario every single time because the graphics won't work...<br />
<br />
I've ran into this problem on a couple of ideas that players have given me for a modpack...I'd love to make a Robocop or Simcity modpack...but these ideas are probably best suited to a scenario because a story line and map can be developed better...<br />

<br />
You bring up a good point that I'd like to expand on. I think that most scenarios would not play well as modpacks. Many scenarios<br />
 ~ don't have settlers or diplomats<br />
 ~ don't have a full complement of wonders and improvments<br />
 ~ have extremely short tech trees<br />
 ~ just to name a few practices scenario makers employ<br />
These things would tend to make for an unplayable regular game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andrew Livings</div><div class="date">Mar 10, 2001, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm usually to busy creating to play any new games with a modpack, so I usually stick to scenarios. I just had two weekends of Star Trek, so it's back to creating again.<br />
<br />
I'm currently designing my next project, which is a post-1945 modpack/scenario. It's a little hard to define: I'm not calling it a &quot;Cold War&quot; scenario, because that raises expectations that the scenario file should be a rather rigid re-creation of post-1945 history. Instead I'm more concerned with the units and technologies, and the development of the various sides. It's really more a post-1945 multiplayer environment, allowing for warfare or development. Hard to steer a middle way.<br />
<br />
The units are all generic, because there are lots of generations. This means I don't need any special technologies, so the whole thing is suitable to play as a mod-pack. I always allow lots of research by having a stuffed tech-tree, and within certain hard-coded limitations, this will as well. You can use events in a normal civ2 game, so for a modpack you could have simple background texts about some of the technologies, actual events, etc. It can be made interesting.<br />
<br />
The only problem I'm going to have is with the barbarians - another hardcoded liability. If you want a classic mod-pack, then you are really restricted in what units you can have and in what slot they go. An additional problem is the sound associations have forced me to order my units in such a way that a lot of the ground unit slots used by barbarians are now taken by air units. Though I think I may have a solution, it's imperfect as the player could only choose the &quot;Village only&quot; set-up option for barbarian activity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreadnought</div><div class="date">Mar 10, 2001, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright i'm a vetern civ player and have all kinds of sceanarios but i don't know anything about mod pack (how they work, what they are, what they do, etc.)<br />
<br />
On that note i say scenarios are just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Mar 11, 2001, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Andrew, I wanted to say that I think your idea is a good one. I generally find that authors tend &quot;not&quot; to create their scenario or their modpacks to be used in either course, but rather they have a very rigid approach...in other words, authors usually intend for their scenario or modpack to be used as either one or the other but not both...*the crowd cheers*<br />
<br />
In 1998, Paul Cauldwell and Kevin Gilbert were out there building what I would call mult-use scenario/modpacks...other authors have rarely followed suit...<br />
<br />
Oryx, your points regarding the creation strategies of scenarios are excellent and I think that it is more than true that scenario authors have been able to focus more creatively on the storyline of scenarios because civ scenarios have become a &quot;rubix&quot; puzzle for authors. I've seen some really ingenius things from terrorming water/land to multiple simultaneous maps.<br />
<br />
Another thing I would like to add is that with Modpacks, they are created with the idea that the author will have very little control as to outcome of the game...essentially, there are very few tricks or tips for modpacks and you are really just playing a regular civ game for most mods. <br />
<br />
In a way, scenarios fall very short in the area of originality once they are played to the end for the first time. Scenarios are entirely goal oriented; once you know the design of the scenario, you start to go straight to the goal. Good scenarios are still fun the second time around. <br />
Basically, you need to have a hard drive filled with so many scenarios that by the time you finish the last one, you can't remember what you did on the first.<br />
