<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunderfall</div><div class="date">May 31, 2002, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope you all had fun playing last month's deity level GOTM.  We have a very standard game this month, except for land mass (which is 60% water). The starting position is probably the best one in all of the GOTMs. You have easy access to a few luxury resources and there are *numerous* rivers nearby. It should be a pretty easy game if you're used to Monarch level.<br />
<br />
Here are the game parameters: <br />
<br />
Civ: Germans<br />
Difficulty: Monarch<br />
Map size: Standard<br />
Map shape: Continents.3<br />
Barbarians: Raging Horde<br />
Climate: Normal<br />
Temperature: Temperate<br />
Age: 4 Billion Years<br />
Game: All victories; Restarting players off<br />
Opponents: 6 Rivals<br />
<br />
Savedgames are due July 2nd, 2002. <br />
<br />

<br />
Let's see if I can finish GOTM7 before I go to bed this morning...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">May 31, 2002, 08:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm... Grey Fox may be able to finish GOTM games in one sitting, but us mere mortals take more time (it's also game #8, by the way). :) I think this one will be a nice break from the last game, though plenty of players will find it to be a good challenge as well on Monarch. I won't get to it though until I finish the RB Epic#2 game, so keeping away from the spoilers thread for the next week or so is going to be a challenge!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just once an hour. I just happened to check it 5 minutes later once. :)<br />
<br />
I was kind of hoping for a lower difficulty though...<br />
But, I geuss it'll have to do.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, right now, I'm currently confusing a barb unit by switch my spear from city to city. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JohnnyReb</div><div class="date">Jun 01, 2002, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One quick question.  I've read and understand the rules, but there was one thing not mentioned.<br />
<br />
Are we allowed to play the game more than once (in case we bomb the first time, though it is Monarch so should be okay) and submit our best?  Or is this a one shot deal?</div></div><hr />

It's a one shot deal. Replaying/Reloading the game is consider cheating...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gotcha, thanks.  Knew about the reloading, just wasn't sure about playing a second or third time, although if you think about it, you would already know the layout so it should be banned :).  Thanks!</div></div><hr />

WHY do all the GOTM have Barbarian Raging?</div></div><hr />

Not true... 5 out of 8 GOTMs didn't have raging barbarians. :)<br />

Very close, one of the other civs had 7 parts done, and 2 on they way when I finished, they just didn't have Laser. I won't say anymore.<br />
<br />
At one point, I was really taking a pummeling from my nearest neighbour, but I got over it in the end. :)<br />
<br />
My game was nothing spectacular, but I thought I'd sumbit it anyway, its my first attempt at a GOTM. :)<br />

Check out the GOTM thread on how to submit a game.<br />
<br />
Attaching it to this thread does NOT submit the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LKendter</div><div class="date">Jun 02, 2002, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">An additional piece of information should be included in ALL future GOTM posts - <br />
Culturally linked  status.<br />
<br />
It has already become obvious which way this game is, but it would be very nice to know when you start the game.</div></div><hr />

its called the snoopy mod.you can find it in the completed modpackt section in the forum creation and costumation:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exactly why I  *don't * use Culturely linked.  <br />
Actually I was starting to fizzle on Civ3 until they brought out the patch the let us get rid of that option.  It was getting to boringly predictable.</div></div><hr />

I know that posting it here in the thread doesn't submit a game. I already filled in the webform and emailed it. I just posted it in case anyone was interested ... I guess I won't do that next time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Higher Game</div><div class="date">Jun 03, 2002, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is culturally linked? It was a new option after the new patch but it wasn't really explained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JohnnyReb</div><div class="date">Jun 03, 2002, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It means civilizations of similiar cultures will tend to start near you.  For example if you play the Japanese and enable the cultural starting positions then there is a good chance the Chinese, Indians, and..er..I forget other asian ones at the moment...will start near you.<br />
<br />
You can view the civs in the editor to see what culture they are a part of.<br />
<br />
Actually, I think the culturally linked starting has always been around.  The patch just gave the option to disable it (though I could be wrong here).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grey Fox</div><div class="date">Jun 03, 2002, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are right, it was a standard rule from the start that couldn't be altered. And cultural starting locations are standard because I believe th civs are sortof balanced against eachother in terms of UU's etc (with exceptions).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I believe it's good to be able to turn it off, but I have grown fond of it. Feels more natural.</div></div><hr />

OK, sorry about that. I didn't think it was a spolier, because by reading my post no one would have really learned anything unless they downloaded the attachment. Next time I won't do that.</div></div><hr />
