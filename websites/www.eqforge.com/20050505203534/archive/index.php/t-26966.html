<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jul 12, 2002, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please read this info before answering the Poll.<br />
<br />
Read all the choices carefully before selecting the option that best fits your game. BE PATIENT, most of the choices above will not apply to any typical game.<br />
<br />
For the purposes of the question, we will sort of assume that you somehow made direct contact with Japan in the July 02 GOTM9 because of their close proximity to our start position acroos a narrow coastal body of water. Beyond that first contact with the japanese there are a number of interesting options.<br />
<br />
THE KEY QUESTION HERE IS: Who did you make contact with next after Japan? <br />
<br />
Just like last month's contact poll, you need to interpret where you were in the game and what you were doing in order to answer the poll correctly:<br />
<br />
If you were moving a unit across a body of water separated from your towns and cities when you made contact, then you discovered the other guy.<br />
<br />
If the other civ was moving a unit on land or sea and the contact occurred near your towns or cities, then they discovered you.<br />
<br />
In particular there are three choices (marked with *) in the poll that relate to making contact between eqypt and the other civs by using a landmass that was sort of centrally located neutral ground. Depending on how your expansionist strategy played out, this landmass could have belonged to many different people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found Japan, Persia, Aztecs and Germany on their home continents. I traded with Germany for the American contact.<br />
<br />
I met Persia before the Aztecs but by getting the Persian map I did not have to pay what they wanted for Aztec contact. Since it was only two turns away it was cheaper to just travel up the coast.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jul 12, 2002, 11:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CB et al,<br />
<br />
Sorry this sounded so complicated. The key question is &quot;Who came next after Japan and how did you meet them?&quot;<br />
<br />
In your case, I think the answer would be one of the three Persia choices depending on where you met the Persians. If you had crossed the gulf and met them in a Persian city then that would be choice number 5. If you met them in a city that was captured from the aztecs then that was choice number 4.<br />
<br />
I was guessing here that in some games Persis may have gone to may with the Aztecs fairly eraly since they had started so close. Also after discovering more of the map I could see only a couple of options for realistically getting contact and that led me to try and frame the response options as you see them above. My guess was that lots of contact would take place on either sides of the gulf depending on how the games fell out from the RNG.</div></div><hr />

I have not voted.<br />
<br />
I made contact with the Americans after they placed a city on my home island. I then traded with them for contact with all the other CIVS.<br />
<br />
PS: At a later date their city flipped to me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serg</div><div class="date">Jul 13, 2002, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How must I vote if I met Aztecs and Persian simultaneously (I sailed up to their continent on the border)? And I don't know was persian city aztec's earlier or wasn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jul 13, 2002, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Phillip, your vote should probably be that the other civs found you directly.<br />
<br />
Serg, your's is a tougher decision but should be based  on looking at the map as carefully as you can. You have three choices that would apply: Aztecs, Persians, or Persians in a captured Aztec city. Persians were at war with the Aztecs or had been at war with the Aztecs then I would probably pick the Persians in or near an Aztec city option because that reflects the early Aztec vx Persian war event and I feel the war event is a significant part of the puzzle. If the town name was like alphabet soup, it probably used to be Aztec (or Hawaiian).<br />
<br />
There is also a nice sort of valley/basin on the Aztec/Persian continent near the center and just across from the Jungle Isle gulf. To the north of this valley should probably have been Aztecs and to the south of this valley should probably have been Persians.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Serg</div><div class="date">Jul 13, 2002, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was Samaria (Persian).</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I was colonizing the two islands north-west of our starting position, an American galley came there, cos they have built the Great Lighthouse. Then I traded contacts: they got to know the Japanese (soon enough they'll get to know them anyway) and I got to know the Germans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I know this poll is hard. Lots of permutations.<br />
<br />
In your case, if the americans found you on one of the first two islands and NOT the big junglecover island in the middle of the map (with dyes) then I woudl say the other civs found you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Jul 17, 2002, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They did find me on the &quot;junglecover&quot; island and I already had cities there, so I voted the third one with asterisk. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">civ_steve</div><div class="date">Jul 17, 2002, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Japan beat me to MapMaking by a couple of turns, and had already begun colonizing the 3 nearest islands.  I rushed settlers and swordsmen out, and overwhelmed his colonies once he began hostilities (AI stupidity, but it was only a matter of time.)<br />
<br />
I had scouted out the big center island.  The Aztecs had the GL.  Eventually I noticed that their culture boundary had popped up on the previously scouted but uninhabited part of the island.  Later I sent a swordsman to make contact.  In one turn I made contact with everyone else and made up several techs by serially trading the few items I uniquely possessed (Literature, my World Map, Contact with Japan, and about 1500 gp).</div></div><hr />
