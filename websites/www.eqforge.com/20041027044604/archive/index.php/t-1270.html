<br />
Have recently been messing around with a scenario and I keep reading people talking about using events and so I was hoping someone could give me the lowdown. <br />
<br />
Basically what an event is, how it works, how do you write one, what are the limitations/ paramaters, etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BeBro</div><div class="date">Feb 11, 2001, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi engineer, many civ2 scenarios contain a file named events.txt. In this file you can define several actions that should happen during your scenario (comparable to the triggers in Starcraft or Age of Kings).<br />
<br />
Therefore you can use the events macro language, simple commands that allow you things like, disabling diplomacy in a scenario, create units at a special turn and in special locations on the map, give techs to a certain civ and so on.<br />
<br />
Simply open an existing events.txt of another scenario and look into it, then you´ll find out a lot more. If you have the FW or MGE version, you can simply use its events editor to create and edit the events.txt for your scenario. It has also a &quot;Help&quot; button, which leads you to detailed info about the single commands.<br />
<br />
Many players prefer instead a simple text editor like notepad for editing the events.</div></div><hr />

Here is the link.  It's not a big scenario, and has events for giving techs, units, and messages.  Just something to look at.  My first scenario with events too, (I think) http://www.geocities.com/thecornmaster/scenario/Saudi/Saudi.zip  <br />
<br />
It's also a mission based scenario, which means it should only take about 30 minutes to finish it.  I prefer mission based because it allows me to expand on the normal Civ 2 idea.  Anyway.....Enjoy<br />
