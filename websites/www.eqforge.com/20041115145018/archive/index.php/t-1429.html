<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Little Sicily</div><div class="date">May 09, 2001, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I expect I will have a playable version of this by the end of the week, and marginal new graphics the week after that. For now, here's a quick preview just to let you know what it's all about.<br />
	<br />
Legend of the Five Rings, by the way, is not my own creation. For more information on it, please visit  http://www.wizards.com/l5r/  and  http://www.deathseeker.com <br />
<br />
The last Emperor of the Hantei Dynasty is dying, and he has no heir. Thus the great Clan War begins, and the next heir will be whomever proves to be the most powerful, enlightened or honorable. Meanwhile, to the south, the demons in the Shadowlands begin to stir, and some say their dark lord is returning, but that can never happen so long as the twelve black scrolls are kept safe...<br />
<br />
There are seven clans playable in this scenario.<br />
The Crab: Guardians of the Wall, their duty is to hold the Shadowlands at bay.<br />
The Crane: The wealthiest clan, they have the best poets, courtiers and duelists.<br />
The Dragon: The mountain clan, these mysterious mages and warriors are best known for their elaborate tattoos.<br />
The Lion: The warrior clan, they have the mightiest armies and the best tacticians.<br />
The Phoenix: The keepers of knowledge, they have the best spellcasters in the empire.<br />
The Scorpion: The finders of secrets, no clan trusts them, yet all are in their debt.<br />
The Unicorn: The outsider clan, this mighty cavalry returned from the Burning Sands hundreds of years ago, but are still shunned as barbarians.<br />
<br />
There are two tech trees. The enlightenment path, though more difficult, leads to heroic legend and an indisputable victory. The path of shadow offers swift access to powerful armies, but at a price. <br />
<br />
I'll be posting updates and screenshots as it nears completion. Expect more info soon.</div></div><hr />
