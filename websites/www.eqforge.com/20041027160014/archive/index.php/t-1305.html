<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ahenobarb</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2001, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please help.  I quit playing Civ I years ago and have just gotten into Civ II.  I now want to tweak the game the way I want and would like to edit the units (very basic to you experts).  However, everytime I edit a unit, or just include one I like from another scenario file, Civ II won't start.  Instead, it gives an error message.  I have been reading up on this in the Great Icon LIbrary to no avail.  Any suggestions/tips.  I am using Microsoft Photo Draw and the Paint program that comes with windows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Mar 08, 2001, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem lies in the type of gif file that is required. In the simplest terms:<br />
<br />
1. Open any unit.gif file icon that come with your Civ package with paint and save it as units.bmp. Civ will recognise the bmp file more easily as there is only one kind of bmp format. Saving in gif format from most programs (with the exception of paintshop pro and a few others) will result in a crash as they are palette and format issues.<br />
<br />
2. From now on, work exclusively in paint and save only in bmp format (256 colours).<br />
<br />
3. This solution does not require you to download anything, learn anything or transfer anything from one program to another.<br />

If you have Civ II classic you can't use paint to save it in gif-format. You can edit units and icons there, bud you have copy and paste them into Corel Photopaint or JASC Paintshop Pro to save them as a for the program valid gif-format.<br />
<br />
2. If you have Fantastic Worlds, you shouldn't have trouble with paint I  think. In that case it's what kobayashi says. Save it as 256-color bmp.<br />

Don't forget to look through the downloads section under &quot;graphics&quot; there are a lot of cool units there too...<br />
