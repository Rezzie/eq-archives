<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2003, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please vote CG, Boots, Vander, or abstain. This poll will remain open until the end of the month GMT.<br />

The Election Office Staff</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2003, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I encourage the Fanatican citizenry to re-elect me for PD.  I have 3 consecutive terms of PD experience, not including the fact that I've had one term each of Culture Deputy, Trade Deputy, PSC board member, and mayor.  I have been an active member of the Judiciary and of the game as a whole, and have never failed to post Judicial Review when it is requested.  I also helped to clear charges in a PI case against DZ earlier this term.  With the exception of around three days before term 8 in Demogame II, I have always been Public Defender in the demogame since my joining it.  In conclusion, a vote for bootstoots is a vote for Fanatica.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I should also add that Vander isn’t active in the SP demogame, whereas I am very active here.  I also have the most Judicial experience, as stated in the above post.  Neither of my opponents has any SP demogame Judicial experience.  I promise to continue my career as Public Defender, which I have been for 3 solid months, in the best possible fashion.  I will be fair and impartial, and will help in any PI cases that come up.  I will also help to write laws, including a possible new CoL.  A vote for me is a vote for the continuation of the excellent job the Fanatican Judiciary is doing, and every vote counts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vander</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although I don't have too many posts under my belt, Bootstoots is wrong there.  I visit this site everyday.  If I feel I need to post something, I will.  I don't post everyday. I have no reason to have a high post count; no ego to fill.  I plan on being a humble public defender.  Given the musings to overhaul the current government system, I will be needed.<br />
<br />
Also, I was the first Chief Justice of the Multi-site demogame and a current Justice in the Apolyton Alpha Centauri Demogame.  Sorry Bootstoots, you were wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stated that you were not very active in the single player demogame.  I do not see any reason to try to get a very high post count, but you do not participate very much, not posting in polls, citizen discussions, government threads, etc very often.  Activity is measured by particpation more than visiting the site everyday.  Though it is true that you have experience in other demogames (such as the MSDG), you lack experience in this particular game.  I have been very active in other aspects of the game as well.  I have been the Culture Deputy, I am the current Trade Deputy, I am a PSC board member and have posted poll reviews, and I am the Mayor of Skunkworks and have instituted a Provincial Government system in Esquiline province.  I have also recently become the ambassador to Apolyton in the MSDG.  I feel that this additional experience greatly helps me in the Judiciary, and is evidence of my participation.  I encourage all citizens who have not yet voted to cast their ballots for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The poll results are the following:<br />
Bootstoots: 12<br />
Vander: 9<br />
CivGeneral: 4<br />
Abstain: 0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congratulations Boots. I look forward to working with you again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 07:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Peri.  Vander, I congratulate you for an election that was much closer than I expected.  Job well done! :)</div></div><hr />
