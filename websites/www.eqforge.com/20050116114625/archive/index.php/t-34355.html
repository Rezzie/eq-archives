<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Narz</div><div class="date">Oct 16, 2002, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone.  I finally got my C++ Complier, its the MetroWerks CodeWarrior learning edition.  I am really looking forward to getting into it and hopefully having a long and enjoyable &quot;career&quot; as a programer.  Ideally I want to program games, both 1 player games and ones that can be played online.  I'm not trying to get big into graphics, I want to design classics and classics (like Civ I) don't necessarily need fancy graphics.  Besides if I get good enough designs and get other people to see the value in them I can probably find others who specialize in graphics to join me.<br />
<br />
My question is, do any of you guys know any good forums for C++ programmers?  This would really make all this difference for me since I'm just getting started and all.  Thanks!<br />

The ones I've seen (I haven't tried looking for them much) had arrogent people there. (which is not how progammers are) Well, 1 was arrogent (couldn't make a post without saying something nasty). <br />
<br />
There is a Developers page, of which I'll have to get the link to. Just do a search for Game Developers (even tutorials). I can get you some of the basics here, but it would be quite long. :)</div></div><hr />

It's mainly VB, but it has a C/C++ forum too!</div></div><hr />

<br />
C++ is better if you're doing gaming anyway Narz, so don't listen to jpowers.  I'll have a quick looksee at my uni connections, might be able to find some help pages, but prolly no forums.<br />
<br />
(EDIT)<br />
Also, I use Borland Compiler, it's pretty good but i don't know if it's free.  Don't have anything to compare it to either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Narz</div><div class="date">Oct 20, 2002, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually took a course in VB, about 6 weeks, 8 hours a day when I was 18.  Man I hated it!  Don't remember a thing either but I had to keep going cause my parent's paid for it and wouldn't let me quit.  I remember we even spent a week learing how to build a database, uggh it was horrible.<br />
<br />
But now, I'm learning on my own and it'll be fun, I'm gonna make games!<br />
