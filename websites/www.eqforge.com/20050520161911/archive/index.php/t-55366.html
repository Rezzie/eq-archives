<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 07, 2003, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here are the basic rules for this idea:<br />
<br />
* an absence must be posted with from-to date and the affected characters in a specially designed absent-thread<br />
* before an absence, all units must be either inside the own territory or the controll of them must be given to someone.<br />
* the affected characters wont age or die. nor can anyone attack the territory and as such attack the troops in the territory.<br />
*If the player controles something that is vital to the game he would have to give controll of it to a player or a manager.<br />
*Players\Managers that controll a absent persons things will have to do so in the absent players best interest.<br />
*If something he owns becomes vital to the game a manager will controll it.<br />
*The absent player may write in his absent post how he want the managers\players to controll his things.<br />
*If the absent player isnt back to the date he set up, he is given 24h before the players things is &quot;unfrozen&quot;<br />
<br />
The point of this would be that people could leave tyhe rpg for a vacation or something witout having to start all over again when they return..<br />
<br />
It hasnt had its own discussion thread but it was discussed here:  http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?threadid=55064</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i say yes as we will need this to let people leave for some days without being dead. anyways, one thing should maybe be changed:<br />
if a player is absent and has given his troops to someone else, then those troops may NOT be in the &quot;absented&quot; territory nor go into that territory during the absence.</div></div><hr />
