<br />
Things to consider:<br />
RedBull, you seem to have a barb scenario to deal with as well. We're also in position to bribe that knight, maybe it's worth 236g to not lose dip and to get another offensive unit in the area.<br />
<br />
Next turn we'll get our second cavalry in Dou, +one that was allready there. I realize I probably should have spent more money on them.<br />
<br />
Our treasury: 2496g. We probably discover Refrigeration next turn.<br />
<br />
I haven't dared moving out our engineer from BF, it has been charged twice. Engineer in Igl should clear jungle near Igl (charged thrice).<br />
<br />
We should consider more defence in Sup, el and LP.<br />
<br />
Ready to found city on BJ1, maybe we should let RedBull name it?<br />
<br />
We can grow VM and Igl one pop each next turn if we rearrange workers.<br />
<br />
I've had to invent some work for some of the settlers as we can't build farmland yet, but not much. E.g. desert near RF is roaded and watered.<br />
<br />
How about transfering one of the RM in BS to Trollhättan, and move the cavalry back to Coresux?<br />
<br />
I now see that there is a commodity free in Dou, Hides... came up very recently. I suggest finishing that cavalry next turn, then build the caravan (this will give us time to farm before the supermaret is built), then a supermarket, then another cavalry for defence (if the other leaves for Africa).<br />
<br />
Apparently an aztec catapult is blocking the path to intombe. Unless they move it, we should consider bringing a dip or send the cavalries by boat. The catapult square is a good location for a channel later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 10, 2003, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great job, in particular we have far more cash than I was expecting us to have :goodjob:<br />
<br />
Looks like we are finally getting the opportunity to get some NONE units near Berlin - there we should bribe, bribe and bribe. Once finsihed we can capture Berlin. We should also bribe the Greek knight, it will soon become a cavarly.<br />
<br />
We will soon have enough cavalry to send to Africa.<br />
<br />
I agree that we need a stronger military force in Woodstock but northeastern Coresux is well defended now.<br />
<br />
As has been discussed funxus will be away next week and there's no vice president so according to the chain of command I play. I will probably do so on Wednesday give or take a day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedBull</div><div class="date">Jul 10, 2003, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My input can be found in the DEFSAT for this turn.<br />
<br />
And as for &quot;Ready to found city on BJ1, maybe we should let RedBull name it?&quot;<br />
<br />
How about Mozzarella? Why? Why not? :crazyeye:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jul 11, 2003, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">When bribing units close to BF, make sure that won't be supported there, and if they do (e.g. greek knight) a rearrangement of workers will be needed, or else they'll riot. Either we see if it's enough to work both the wine and gold (neither is worked at the moment) or hire elvis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 16, 2003, 10:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will start playing near 20:00 GMT today (Wednesday) unless something pops up that requires discussion (for example a new poll).<br />
<br />
It may seem slightly confusing what to do about Hell. A long time ago it was decided with a slim majority to invade western Hell when technologically and economically ready. We are ready but as has been discussed elsewhere it is extremely tempting to capture Athens and nearby cities instead. It has also been argued that we should delay any action against the Greeks until we have a more advanced military (tanks, battleships etc.). Exactly what (if anything) to do has not been decided.<br />
<br />
However, this is not a major problem now. The usual 5-10 turns played are not enough to do anything irreversible against the Greeks (i.e. start action against them) and in fact probably not enough to invade Africa either although our troops should be just off the African shores 5-10 turns from now. Regarding the Greeks, I'll do some military buildup as this is consistent with the Coresux build queue poll. Action can then quicky be started against them if we decide on it. This means that funxus gets to take care of the fun and fireworks next week in Africa and maybe Hell as well :D.</div></div><hr />
