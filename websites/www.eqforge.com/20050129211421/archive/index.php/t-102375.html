<br />
A few months ago I went to a highly recomended computer store and bought a new motherboard, processor and power supply. Ever since then i've been having some problems. I paid them to install everything so it would be 'covered.' But when I got it home and started having problems I phoned them and they said they would fix it ... If I paid them $45 (Canadian $35 American?) an hour. They lost my business there because they are the ones who installed it improperly.<br />
<br />
They stated everything was compatible because I took my comp in and showed it to them so there would be no mistakes. The first problem I had, though, was the insane load up times. It would show a pic of the intel HT motherboard info for about 30 secs, try to load, get some writing that would only let me bypass it by ctrl-alt-deling it and then back to another intel pic for the motherboard info. I timed it once ... it took about 1.5-2.5 mins (i'll have to double check it again sometime). I even d/led a program that monitors performance for boot ups to see what was the problem, but it wouldn't even recognize that long waiting periods as part of the boot up and other than the intel stuff and the ctrl-alt-del part it loaded fast.<br />
<br />
Now i'm having problems installing stuff. I get the BSOD that tells me its beginning the physical memory dump everytime I try to install something large from disc. Doom 3, Harry Potter game and now a pre order disc for Everquest 2. I somehow got Doom 3 to install after 2 full days of fiddling.<br />
<br />
I plan on buying more memory and a new HD soon and possibly a new video card but would like this fixed before I add more hardware onto the pile when maybe some of the current stuff is messed and needs replacing.<br />
<br />
Hopefully someone can help me out because i've spent countless hours trying to fix it and searching help forums and FAQs galore and never once found anyone with a similar problem. Lots of BSOD being triggered by different things and never once the intel MB hanging problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Specs (will open up my box to get more info if required, this is all off the top of my head):<br />
<br />
Windows XP<br />
2.4 Ghz<br />
512 RAM (Kingston?)<br />
P-4<br />
SP1<br />
Radeon 9500/9700<br />
HD 5400 rpm<br />
MB Intel PERL865<br />
<br />
Edit:  One thought I just had: Could the problem be my cd-rom drive? I've updated everything since I got this comp except the cd-rom drive and the HD. Sometimes while trying to install these things the comp freezes and restarts while the cd is even trying to just load. I also got one BSOD and one freeze before Star Wars: Battlefront would install.</div></div><hr />

If, after they've installed everything, there are error messages when the computer boots then they haven't done the job properly and would have to fix things at their expense. Canadian law might be different of course.<br />
<br />
The first thing I'd need to know is: what error message is being shown when the computer starts, the message that you need to ctrl-alt-del to bypass?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crazy Eddie</div><div class="date">Oct 16, 2004, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, that's a BIOS message rather than an OS one I think. A faulty CD might cause the intermittant installing problems but shouldn't cause any startup problems other than a delay while it initialises, it shouldn't cause boot errors. A few things to try if you haven't already:<br />
Check the BIOS settings and make sure the hard disk is recognised Ok and set as the first boot device. <br />
If the CD is connected to the HD, change it so it's on a seperate IDE channel.<br />
Check the cables for the disks are seated correctly. If possible try a different cable, the old one might need replacing.</div></div><hr />
