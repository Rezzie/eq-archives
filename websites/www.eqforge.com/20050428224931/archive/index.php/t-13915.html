What is the global ranking? Do you have some point system? I'm trying to figure out what you are doing but feel I am obviously missing something important, since most high scores are 3000+, and yet the ranking appears to be perhaps a percentile.<br />

In case you guys don't hear it enough, great job on all of this, its really cool all the medals and the ranking, and the simple work of cataloging all those games.</div></div><hr />

There is my easy to understand-Guide for GotMs scores.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah my global ranking appears to be halved.<br />

Since we have played 2 games, all global rankings get divided by 2 whether both games have been played or not.  Your ranking looks right for what you scored in GOTM2.  Missing the first game won't matter after GOTM4 if you keep playing, as the global rankings only take the 3 highest of the last 5 month's scores into account.</div></div><hr />

I see people with 1 game played (game 2) and they scored lower than me and yet have a higher rating than me.  So I think there is a problem happening in to quite a few people.<br />
<br />
Maybe people with 1 game aren't getting their score halved like they should?  Dunno...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Jan 09, 2002, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I'm sure that your ranking is correct for your score.  It just seems that the column for number of games didn't get updated when Clints score was added to the list.  So a lot of the entries just have a wrong number of games listed, but the rankings seem to be right.</div></div><hr />
