Playing with foreknowledge is disallowed!<br />
<br />
Since it seems there isn't one, I'll start it for this month.<br />
<br />
Anyways, it looks like a nice start after a little exploring.  3 wheat nearby, and a quick access to spices.  After further exploration, I found the grassland to the south which looks even nicer.  Then came the bottleneck that I found.  Which became my first objective, so my 3rd &amp; 4th cities sealed off the bottleneck.  After that objective was complete I've now started expanding onto the Babs &amp; Persian side of the continent and secured a source of ivory.  Having that extra lux should help later.  <br />
<br />
Then came Iron Working and my big delima of no iron on our half.  So I started assembling my archers to take Nineveh from the Babs which was their only iron city.  Took Nineveh and Ellipi and sued for peace and got Akkad in the peace treaty.  Assembled more archers and declared Babylonian War 2.  That led me to destroying Uruk and a newly founded Nineveh and capturing Babylon.<br />
<br />
I'm now in 70 BC preparing for War #3 most likely as the Babylonians are down to 2 cities and I want those silks from them.  After that I should have the whole south side of the continent which seems to be the nicer half of it anyways.  I still haven't even settled the spices on our half of the continent since I've bottlenecked our half off.  I also now control both horses on the island, which will definately come in handy, especially when Cavalry rolls around and I can roll over the Persians in that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don´t be to shy.;) Or are  all of you cheaters?:mad: <br />
<br />
Anyway. I started my GotM yesterday evening and played until late night. Got a settler from the first goodie hut :) and lots of barbarians from the later :cry:. The managed to destroy my scouting warrior :eek: so I finally got no bonus from the first goodie huts...<br />
<br />
The difficult level is very interesting. Never had so many time to expand without war. The ancient age the wasn´t any swordfight unless the one with the barbarians. <br />
<br />
Think that this will change now... :D :egypt:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemming</div><div class="date">Apr 02, 2002, 03:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so this is my story so far:<br />
<br />
had quite a good start, settled the wide area east of the bottleneck. grabbed all the land and resources while fortifying at  the bottleneck to make sure noone can pass. made contact with both persians and babylonians, with the babs being the stronger civ of those two. <br />
<br />
biggest problem was that i had no iron, all iron resources were located in persian/babylonian territory...so i built a huge horseman-army and started to wage a war with the persians. it turned out that they werent much of a problem, i even got two cities through peace negotiations...<br />
<br />
the persians had one iron city and it was my highest priority to conquer this city. meanwhile the babs also declared war to persia and tried to get that iron city, too...they obviously knew of the importance of that city...and they were a real PITA, their immortals gave me a very hard time. so i managed to conquer the city, but for the next ten turns or so it was a brutal war with many many losses on both sides...however finally they gave up and i made peace with them..<br />
<br />
so now i finally have the important iron, and i'm waiting for chivalry to upgrade all my horsemen...after that i think i will attack the babs...it will not be easy, because they have nearly the same landmass and are quite strong with their immortals...<br />
<br />
i wonder how the other civs are doing, i think they are much stronger, england and zulu already built 2 wonders and i  just entered the middle age...<br />
<br />
but all in all a funny game till now with much of action...i think its absolutely crucial to get a hold of that iron somehow, otherwise you have no offensive options...<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: <br />
uh, i just remembered that we're playing the indians so they need no iron for their elephants...ok, so i think you dont need that iron in the beginning, you can kick some butt with your elephants, too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 02, 2002, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've played up to ***** so far.  I started out thinking I'd try to trigger domination without fighting, and build every wonder.  The fact that we started out on a smaller landmass changed my mind about the domination, though I might still be able  to do it.  I have gotten every wonder so far, up to Sistene's.  I'm sure the rest will be easy, everyone else has been relying on me for techs for quite some time now.  I can't get any gold per turn though, not sure why.  I haven't broken any agreements, and everyone is Polite.<br />
<br />
As soon as I got Mapmaking I started suicide runs across the Sea/Ocean, looking for any other land.  My 3rd galley made it across, and my 4th too!  Both on different routes.  I made contact with all the other Civs, but that didn't help much, no one had anything I didn't.<br />
<br />
I've been fighting a massive culture war on the starting continent, no luck with cultural conversions so far, even though I have 3 times the culture of all 7 of the AI combined.  :mad:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hobbes</div><div class="date">Apr 02, 2002, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Monday was a holiday, and the first day of the month.  So what do you think I did with my day off?  Play Civ3 GOTM6, all day and night (until the start of the NCAA finals). [dance]  I managed to play till around 1500 AD.<br />
<br />
Wonderful map, and playing at warlord is delightful, I feel like I am the AI playing on deity. :cool:  Got lucky at the start and popped two settlers from huts, even got a few techs.  Other than losing a warrior to some barbs that popped out of one, I felt like I was an expansionist civ.  I had friendly relations with Persia and Babylon to start with and when traded for Iron Working from the Persians, I was mortified to find out that the Persians had all of the iron. :eek:  Building the Colossus triggered an early great age, and this helped me to build up my infrastructure quick.  :goodjob:  Soon the Persians were at war with the Babs, and I decided to help out the Persians.  After beating up on the Babs for a while and getting a few cities,  I made peace and started to build horsemen.  Having read Sir Plebe's crusade strategy, I decided that this was my best option.  Horsemen and money, and a quick path to Chivalry so that I could do the baby elephant walk across Babylon and Persia (War elephants don’t need iron)  :D<br />
<br />
So that’s were I am now, I  have eliminated the Babs and Persians and now have eyes for the main continent.  I have built/taken a few cities and tonight I plan to take a few more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Genuis</div><div class="date">Apr 02, 2002, 05:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">haha, nice &quot;conquest&quot; Aeson.  I love it when the AI builds no culture in its cities, it makes everything so much easier...<br />
<br />
Sounds like you all started your wars late.  Well, I started mine pretty early.  As soon as I found the Babylonians I attacked.  The first war lasted 1000 yrs without result but I was still able to get all of their techs even though I had lost more warriors and archers than they had...<br />
<br />
After building another small force of veteran archers I attacked again and sent the Babylonians packing.  I colonized the land all the way out to the iron near the Persians and built a city to take the iron.  I may have to wait on my conquest of Persia until I get Knights at least, depending on how many Immortals they are cranking out.  <br />
<br />
I'm really glad this GOTM was on Warlord.  Makes it so much easier although I might develop some bad habits...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dikwhit</div><div class="date">Apr 02, 2002, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">not too bad a gotm , or so it seems.  The only serious difficulty is even if you take half the island during REX is the lack of strategic resources but thankfully the computer trades like a moron on warlord.My play version however has descended into chaos. Its so far been 5500 years of more or less continious assaults by the computer upon myself or each other by the AI. Fine by me, im more than happy to have my settlers follow their assault forces. Have gotten most of the lower continent and am now making my first real assault to clear the rest off &quot;my island&quot;. Too bad i waited too long and now have to play for conqwest if i want a decent score. Then again its warlord so the scores dont seem to get that good anyway. Oh well ill finish it up today and go back to huge maps on monarch/emp til the next  gotm.<br />
   Can i make a request, for a large/huge map one month soon... im not going to say anything about the difficulty, although i think they should be regent at a minimum, but  i understand the easier levels make it more playable for every1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lemming</div><div class="date">Apr 02, 2002, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">my story continued:<br />
<br />
after taking out the persians, i switched to monarchy and researched like crazy to get chivalry first. in the meantime i sent out some galleys and they discovered the chinese in the north...they were a few techs ahead, and i got contact with all the others. seems i'm a bit behind in tech but still leading the pack scorewise.<br />
<br />
finally i researched chivalry, upgraded my horsemen-army to elephants and taught these babylonian immortals a lesson they'll never forget :D...just as i began my conquest i built the colossus, triggering a golden age, which speeded up things even more...<br />
<br />
moreover i got a leader and built the FP in the middle of the (once) babylonian territory. now they had absolutely no chance and i destroyed them within a few turns :D :D <br />
<br />
now its 1300 AD, i'm sitting alone on that island and planning my next steps...the chinese are HUGE, they conquered the whole zulu empire, england is also very strong...germans are weakest, so i think i will try an invasion at the south of the big continent next... <br />
<br />
:cool: <br />
<br />
i really like that GOTM :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babble-on</div><div class="date">Apr 02, 2002, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too am currently wagin a culture war against the Babylonians and the Persians. Fortunately, I was the first one to get Map Making and just started shipping out settler/spearmen units to &quot;seed&quot; them in a thin line right in between the persian empire and the babylonian one. Currently, I am trying my hardest to get those small cities to build temples, libraries, courthouses and coloseums so that they can swallow up the competing cities. I have already made it around the &quot;horn&quot; of this smaller continent using the extra navigation that the lighthouse granted me, I have made contact with the Chinese and traded contact with all of the other civilizations on the map and am currently trying to establish trade relationships to suck them dry of all of their money.<br />
<br />
I have noticed that there are actually some nitches on the right hand side of the map (actually just off of the coast of where the game begins, but on the other continent) where I can start another culture war and hopefully its proximity to the capital will help with corruption. Once I have things going well there, and I can switch to communism to help the production of cultural buildings, I wil probably plant my forbidden city there and start absorbing the smaller civs. I crippled the babylonians when they were starting out enough that I can clear them out, and then head for the germans. My biggest current competitors are the zulus, but they are so far from my &quot;homeland&quot; across the northern sea, that I am just going to have to wait for modern warfare to take them out.</div></div><hr />

i still got an early golden age from oracle and collosus.  <br />
im usually not a big fan of the indians because of their uu, bt this map gives you the perfect place to use them.  i found myslef ready for knight combat and without iron.  that doesnt always happen with the indians so in this case the elephants are great.  they rolled over the babylonians whom i had denied chivalry.  im now building sistine and are denying horses to persia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dikwhit</div><div class="date">Apr 02, 2002, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WELL JUST FINISHED THE GOTM. VICTORY---LIKE THATS EVER IN DOUBT ON WARLORD BUT IT WAS THE CHEEZY CULTURAL 1.Oops caps sorry. I hate culture wins. Dont get me wrong but if youve got 20-25 cities and build em all you can get cultural victory every time. Didnt really mattter though another 5-10 turns it would have been conqwest, 15 turns on spaceship, or buy the diplomatic vote anytime. 1985 finish, 1261 pts.... god that seems way low but its warlord,,  oh well heres hoping for huge/large monarch lvl for may. good luck all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Often a Pangaea map with 80% water will look like a Continents or even Archipelago map.<br />
<br />
Got lucky at the start and popped two settlers from huts<br />
<br />
Do you know which version of 1.17f you are playing on?  There were 2 different civ3mod.bic files released with 1.17f.  The first version has extra units tagged as available to a barbarian cheifdom in the editor.  This allows armies from huts, and extra Settlers.  <br />
<br />
In my experience with 1.17f huts (second version of the .bic) it isn't possible to get a settler on 4000BC, or more than one in a game from huts.  This includes a test map where I opened 150 huts on the first turn, and well over 1000 overall.<br />
<br />
In a game I played with the first version of the .bic file, I was able to get 6 settlers out of ~50 huts.  Needless to say this can unbalance the game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Justus II</div><div class="date">Apr 03, 2002, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's good to see that I'm not the only one trying to adjust to Warlord level.  I have been so used to playing Emperor, and an ocasional Diety, that this one threw me for a loop.  I don't usually attack first, since the AI is usually more than willing to attack me, but not this time!  I started tonight (that seems so long ago!) and am now at 350AD, and have not fought a single battle except with barbs.  The Colossus just triggered my GA, most of my cities are building cathedrals in 3-5 turns.  Cool!  <br />
<br />
The biggest thing that seemed strange was the Wonders, usually I don't even bother to go for the early wonders, or else I make a mad dash for Great Libary, but this time I got all but Great Wall (didn't want it) and Oracle (chinese beat me by a turn).  I haven't expanded much past the bottleneck, just past the Ivory, and the Babs and Persians are trading me Silks and Iron for techs.  I got lucky, 3 out of 4 galleys made it thanks to Great Lighthouse, so I now have contact with all civs.  <br />
<br />
Should be interesting, I think I will still roll over the Babs and Persians when I get my elephants, just to consolidate this island, but at this point I feel like I could just secure my borders and build toward a culture win.  The problem is most of my cities have every improvement and are running out of stuff to build, so I will have to build up an army, and then I guess I'll have to use it! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joycem10</div><div class="date">Apr 03, 2002, 08:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i didnt like to look of things when I saw that I had no iron avialable.  i researched straight to horseback riding while fortifying the choke point.  As soon as I had an army of about 10 vet horsemen I went after the Babs.  <br />
<br />
about 3 turns into the war I got a golden age by finishing the oracle (had already built the colossus).  my production went thru the roof so I figured what the hell, go for broke.  I set all citieis to producing horsemen and went all out after the babs.  Managed to take them out in around 20 turns.<br />
<br />
The persians were left on the western third of the continent with 2 supplies of iron.  I had a large army of horsemen with at least 4-5 elites and figured I might as well go after them while I have the advantage.  I snuck a horseman into the persian rear thru cultural gaps towards on iron source and moved a galley with 2 spearmen towards the other.I declared war and cut off both iron supplies.  After that It was merely a matter of time.  <br />
<br />
In the course of these wars I got 2 GLs.  Used one for an army and the heroic epic, used the other to rush a palace near old persian-bab border (had already built the FP).  <br />
<br />
I now have contact with the other continent thru the great lighthouse.  I am ahead in tech and have only missed 2 wonders to date.  <br />
<br />
on a side note i love having been at war for 1000 years and still having the tech lead.  warlord is fun!</div></div><hr />

If i have missed something elsewhere sorry for the complaint. Saw the new awards for the gotm. My complaint would consist of the timing. The way i understand it these awards take effect this month, after the competition has started. Some of us have already submitted games without being informed of the rules change midgame. No other competition does this midgame. Its like saying that a touchdown is worth 10 points,  after the first quarter. I am all for the new awards dont get me wrong i am just against it starting midgame as its not a level playing field for all in april.  sorry to gripe but...........</div></div><hr />

Ended up with 360 cities, 41 Settlers on their way to build more.  I didn't fight a single battle against the AI, just a couple of brushes with barbarians early on.  4 cities I was able to culturally convert, otherwise they were all home grown.  My army was comprised of 1 Warrior and 1 Spearman, both of which I would have disbanded if I had known they were there.  I also had 5 Caravels left that had been ferrying the Settlers to their destination.<br />
<br />
I didn't think I was so close to Domination.  It's a good thing I triggered it though, because I had completely run out of Indian mythological, religious, and historical names.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">God</div><div class="date">Apr 03, 2002, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been trying to figure what victory to go for. All of them are possible I probably won't bother with domination. Maybe diplomatic to be original, definetely not culture or maybe spaceship. <br />
<br />
It feels so wierd playing warlord. Its too dull. I can easily out score the AI relatively quickely all though the Persian started off infront of me, but i caught up. It jsut lacks the tech trading and wars and planning which i do for my games. <br />
<br />
I'm getting the hang of Monarch and i'll complete my monster regent game, and hopefully get 4000-5000 points. But this warlord even though just one level below regent is dull. <br />
<br />
The Babs fell early with archers, and then i put an all out assault on the Persians which led to stalemate for a while as the immortals were chowing down my spearmen but i managed to get a horsmen through to their iron and cut it off and then i just fortified all my spearmen over my border cities and waited for the big assault while watching over with some horsemen. The Persians let loose their remaining immortals which razed some cities but then i unleashed my horsemen and archers and we knocked half their empire. Then i got some iron produced swordsmen and finished em' off. <br />
<br />
Now what to do. ?</div></div><hr />

Up to now i have been extremely lucky. against the babylonian.<br />
<br />
they had one bowman left in there last citi ( i guess )   and they had 1 spearman near one of my size 1 city ( we are at war)   instead of killing my citi he try to go to his last citi to save it.. lol<br />
the same turn  The AI captured 3 of my worker and moved them away from the bowman that captured them and next to my archers, so i captured them the next turn whitout a fight and took theire capital...!!!!!<br />
that was fun:)<br />
<br />
i didN'T have much luck with Hut except with the first one that  made my warrior an elite ( he died the first attack he made on babylonian ) and the other gave nothing  except one with pottery,  i guess persian got a settler from hut since they are kind of big.<br />
but still too small to be any match ( i guess and i wish).</div></div><hr />

Anyways am only just in the AD's, and in a good position to go for a few victory types... don't have the patience for moving hundreds of units and cities so that rules out domination and conquest... think I might go for spaceship to see what happens, I still haven't completed a Civ3 game, I usually play on Monarch or Emperor and get bored once its certain I'm going to win... :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
But seeing this was Warlord took a risky civ1/2 strategy of just expand, expand, expand, expand, expand... managed to kill the Babs with some elite warriors and two or three vet archers real earlier, then just totally pushed west as hard as I could towards the Persians... and just managed to grab the iron on the edge of my borders... sweet. Built my Forbidden Palace one city to the west of the original capital, then flipped the Palace over to Nineveh in the centre of the west part of the island and right on the Persians borders. Got Colossus &amp; Great Lib in the same turn (the Zulus beat me to Pyramids by *one* turn :mad: ) which triggered my GA... useful for building lots of granaries... :rolleyes: ... am just in a republic and the middle ages now saving money and building units in preparation to clear my island which will happen in the next few hundred years methinks... have one militia in each city, build a few horsies, get Leonardoes and then upgrade... cut the Persians iron and it'll be all over red rover. :D<br />
<br />
Then libraries, unis, copernicus &amp; newtons in my three gold mountains/river science city should rocket my science ahead to an early space race... stay tuned... :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Apr 03, 2002, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I spent the last week of March (my spring break) wondering what tortures the next GOTM would show me (hey I was pretty bored at times :) ). So when I read the description on April 1st, I was surprised to find a warlord game. And what a warlord game! As my warrior scouts began to explore the land, I discovered I was in a virtual paradise with wheat, cattle, and bonus grassland literally everywhere. After last month's game I felt like I was in the Garden of Eden :lol: <br />
<br />
I decided to go for the &quot;Farmer's Gambit&quot;, rapid expansion with little to no military to back it up. Those three (!!!) wheats around my capital got a lot of use. I had two citites pump nothing but settlers for over a hundred turns, while Dehli, the only city with a barracks, struggled to keep pumping vet spearmen. That's a fun kind of race to loose ;) I had 12 cities to Babylon's 5 when I contacted them around 1500BC :eek: I'm almost scared to wonder what would have happened if I had gotten a settler from a goody hut...<br />
<br />
I built in a spiraling pattern outward from my capital, which meant a ton of rapid-growing, completely uncorrupted cities. When I got the Pyramids around 600BC, my growth literally exploded. I built cities until I reached the Babylonians, then attacked them with tons of horsemen (nothing else for citites to build - first time I've ever had ALL wonders built SO early in the game!) and took them to one city. Then I started &quot;fishing&quot; for great leaders with my elites, and wouldn't you know, the LAST bowmen in their civ gave me a great leader. I put a Forbidden Palace in the dead center of the continent, bringing all of the former Babylonian cities into uncorrupted area. Did I mention this game was going well? :cool: <br />
<br />
After the Babylonians were killed (circa 200AD), I pumped out settlers like mad again (with an army of workers to build roads in connection with them) until I was right on the doorstep of the Persians (literally, when my road net connected to theirs) and attacked. I had a mixed group of swordsmen and horsemen, since many cities had run out of other things to produce. A brave, brave horseman managed to pillage both of Persia's iron sources (I guess another moved onto my island, from what others posted in this forum) and from there it was all downhill for them. <br />
<br />
It's now 550AD (I think) and the Persians have about 6 cities left, and will be gone soon. I built the Great Lighthouse and found the Chinese first, then realized from their world map that there should be civs to the east of my starting position. Voila, there the Germans and English were. The two groups don't have contact and won't get it from me. As soon as Persia is gone, I will transport the Jumbos over to England and begin destroying them. I've never played so much warmongering before, but this is fun and when you have nothing to build by troops in your city, might as well use them!  :goodjob: But it does take a LONG time...<br />
<br />
Let me say I love the idea for this GOTM. After two very difficult games, this easy one was a perfect way for people of all ability levels to have a chance to win and feel like they're doing well. And even for good players, it's fun to see how much punishment can be dealt out to the AI (payback for last month! :mwaha: )<br />
Not sure how to end the game yet, but I think I stand a chance to get a good score with this one. Best of luck to all others playing the game! :king:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Apr 03, 2002, 10:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First two huts were settlers so instead of going for a settler in my main city I pumped out warriors to search for huts, land, resources, and AI.  Had magnigicent luck with most huts, about three knowledges and two settlers all totaled not too bad.  I relized I was playing against the persians so I started to built barracks early to destroy in one fail swoop.  When I relized I had no Iron and they had all but one already I sent a settler too grab the last one before the Bab's got it. <br />
<br />
 Around 1000B.C. had built about two five horseman and moved them surronding the borders of thier iron. I hate fighting immortals so I destroyed their iron cities in about three turns, took about six to wipe out the persians.  Then switched my attention to the Bab's.  Wiped them out by 100A.D., but they popped back up somewhere else and I had to find and destroy them again.  This was over with in about five turns.  I then started pumping out settlers and plotted all my future cities.  <br />
<br />
<br />
1010A.D.  things couldn't have worked out better.   I have just finished putting up my last city on the mainland, forbidden palace is only 2 turns away, and I just finshed the colosos.  I normally don't build it but the AI hadn't so I built it anyway.  Well it Golden Aged me.  Forbidden goes up two turns later.  Before golden age is over I have purchased a library, and courthouse in every city.<br />
<br />
<br />
1300's found the other continent and stopping game for now<br />
tell the rest of my tail when I finish it<br />

kinda a pity this game is to short, will have finished by tommarow april, 5. and have a whole month almost to wait for the next game. pity</div></div><hr />

I just finished the GOM6, by cultural victory, and that wasn't my plan.  I planned on building a huge nation, the UN, and milking it.  The AI loved me the whole game, I made sure of this by giving them all of my resources as a gift, except for those who I traded resources with, and I was poised for victory.  Then comes the modern era just learned computer, and recycling, going to study fussion, and BOW you have achieved a cultural victory.  This is just not cool man, what up. <br />

Hence, improvements, culture and military are not included into score (altough they are the means for achieving the above 3 goals). <br />
<br />
This means that, instead of building one city with a culture producer in it, you could build three or four cities with no culture to grab the same land, thus avoiding hitting the 100000 pt mark. <br />

Although I had to follow them to the ends of the earth. They planted a little colony next to a saltpeter patch on the end of this large continent. So I took it over and got a hold of saltpeter.<br />
<br />
My development of mapmaking and getting the lighthouse really worked to my advantage. I was first in having the entire world map, so I was able to pump out settlers/spearmen units and strategically place them across the northern sea between a handful of Chinese and Zulu settlements (which were very far from the capital.) After rushing a few cultural buildings I had the deep satisfaction of watching my cultural influence expand to swiftly take away an iron source from a Zulu city, and three gold squares away from another Zulu city. Two Chinese towns have overturned to my civ and I can tell that there are about three more on the way to flipping as well. I also planted a few &quot;culture armed&quot; settlements on the lower right end of the larger continent (which is surprisingly close to my capital) and have been taking cities away from the Germans and the English. Cultural expansion and flipping of cities is deliciously satifying! I am at least one hundred points ahead of the closest competitor and I have just developed steam power so I am laying rail like crazy to up the production.<br />
<br />
I unlike others have not killed off the Persians. I have my own iron source linked via harbor so I don't have the urgency of killing them off. Instead, I am robbing them blind with silk and spice trade. They are paying me 40 gold per turn - which I of course put into science to keep ahead of the game.<br />

I am finding this game very entertaining without having to lift a single rifle. :)</div></div><hr />

This is only my second warlord game though, I wasn't used to making 500g per turn and learning in four.  It was unrealistic.  I had tanks before they had cavarly.  I didn't use this advantage though.  I prefer to have a standing military presence just in case a threat from the AI, and quick war.</div></div><hr />

Matrix  this seemed as good a spot as any to lodge my disapproval. If i have missed something elsewhere sorry for the complaint. Saw the new awards for the gotm. My complaint would consist of the timing. The way i understand it these awards take effect this month, after the competition has started. Some of us have already submitted games without being informed of the rules change midgame. No other competition does this midgame. Its like saying that a touchdown is worth 10 points,  after the first quarter. I am all for the new awards dont get me wrong i am just against it starting midgame as its not a level playing field for all in april.  sorry to gripe but........... <br />
No apologies nescessary; I understand your frustration. I should've mentioned it just after it was released, but I was very busy then, therefore I forgot. But it has been discussed and decided, so most people did thought about it (I think). And still, it was only the 3rd when I said it after all...<br />
<br />
So you have my apologies. I'll be more attentive next time. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
one of my scouting warriors found a hut and I got a settler between persia and babylon, so I claimed that iron resource. Once I got roads connecting it, I was able to build 13 swordsmen before it went away :(<br />
<br />
I used them to take out the babs. Since all my core cites were well developed, I went the peaceful route till longbowmen. About 5 turns before I was going to declare war on Persia, they declared war on me... I took about 1/3 of their cities with longbowmen, then right before I got cavalry, I built a bunch of horsemen to upgrade :)<br />
<br />
Persia and Babylon never had communications with the rest of the world. I'm currently in 1100 AD. I've been in a constant state of war with the Zulu's and England -- they wanted contact with Persia. I keep ignoring their envoys now. I have alliances with germany, china, and japan too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">graeme</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is fun...<br />
<br />
I think I started pretty much like most, that is, expanding quickly and closing the bottleneck. As soon as I saw I didn't have any iron, I knew there would be war!<br />
<br />
Long story short, I control the whole continent and have over twice the culture of all the other civs combined. At that point I decided to do something a little different... I am trying to win with espionage! :cool: <br />
<br />
So, I have built a money powerhouse out of my continent with a minimum military. I researched espionage first, then gave communism to everyone. When they each went into anarchy to upgrade from monarchy, I placed a spy in each civ.<br />
<br />
Right now, it's about the 1600s and I am busy overthrowing Zulu, English, German, and Chinese cities! I have about 30000 in the bank and earn about 2000 per turn and have started with cities on the coastline that control any resources (so I can stop trading them). We'll see how long this goes on until they are reduced to nothingness and a victory condition is triggered.<br />
<br />
I don't think I could have taken this strategy on any level above warlord (well maybe regent ;) )</div></div><hr />

<br />
I spread out, found the choak point set up a city there and got 3 cities north of it, but when iron was found I didn't have any.<br />
Got lots of Trireames and the lighthouse.<br />
<br />
I don't do sucide runs with trireams but I exprorer 2 spaces out and if no seas come back, but I found one spot at the bottom right that works with trireams and lighthouse. so I took a chance and had for trireams headed that way with troops, colonist and workes, and found a spot between all the goverments on the big land mass that wasn't occupied yet, and :) found an iron depost near the coast, so I grabbed that and some dyes and furs. and setting up several colony cities in the jungle.<br />
So the cities have problems now, but once the jungles are removed from the city footprint they will be good.<br />
<br />
So by being peacefull I have a large empire and the most points so far, and got lots of cities with lots of stuff in them.<br />
<br />
(My one change is that I normally have a smaller military and then build it up when attacked, this time I'm going for a larger military so the AI will not attack me.)<br />
<br />
Since I started out with alphabit I went straight for writing and lituracty to build the great library.  spending as little science (since more science didn't help) so when I got the great library I had a treasury of 2000 credits.<br />
<br />
Now I'm keeping the nations on the first land mass ignornate of the nations on the second land mass (so they are about 5 tech behind me) and expanded on the second land mass.<br />
<br />
got 4-6 trireams now doing shuttle work carring over seatlers, workers and military units.<br />

hopefully I'll get coal and rubber in all the lands I have now</div></div><hr />

I want to build as many cities as quick as possible, very close together, rushing the cheap temples in all of them, get warrier code fast, producing archers, and settlers.<br />
This strategy works nicely on Monarch level, so it should be fine in warlord as well.<br />
<br />
It turned out quite well, the Babylonians lost a city very early, the Persians one somewhat later. I am having 10+ cities, the Babylonians only two and Persia 4. Researched horseback riding, changed my building sequence to horsmen and settlers the continent is mine.<br />
<br />
Now i'm trying to get one of my ships across to where the other civs should be. The third one survived. Now I'm having contact with everyone else.<br />
<br />
My continent is filled with cities spaced either one ot two tiles apart, everyone has a temple. Now its time to switch to Republic (3 luxuries should be enough on warlord and small cities). I'm keeping research to a minimum and buying libraries, cathedrals and collosseums whatever I can afford.<br />
<br />
The damned Zulus land on my continent and declare war at me. This actually turns out to be very nice. I get an alliance with China and Japan, they do all the fighting, my second war elephant wins a battle - golden age  :lol: <br />
<br />
The English join the Zulus and declare war against me, Germany is coming to help me out against the English - they never made it across to land on my continent.<br />
<br />
I keep buying cultural improvements, the cultural victory should be only a question of time.<br />
<br />
I make peace treaties with everyone, the Japanese destroy the Zulus.<br />
<br />
Finally I trigger a cultural victory in 1758AD. Probably it won't be the fastest, but I should be not too far off.<br />

A very entertaining GOTM - Thanks Matrix<br />

Have full maps of the continent im on ~ no iron for me :(. Up to 16 cities with 5 settlers on the roads [dance]. My culture is squeezing the Perisans and Babs pretty strongly. Debating an attack on the babs for iron. Just a couple of turns into map making and galleys should be coming quickly now. Ive blocked the babs off their horse square and have installed warrriors on the iron supplies to slash them if i need to for war. Almost to monarchy and according to f11 have the two top culture cities. So things seem to be running smoothly. Never played Warlord before so no clue how my score is doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Apr 06, 2002, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only my 2nd GOTM but very enjoyable so far. Victory is not really in doubt but just how is the question. Probably cultural since temples and cathedrals are so cheap.<br />
<br />
Even though the game starts the same for everyone, it is probably good to note that the element of randomness is still there in many things such as yield from goody huts and victory random number generation.<br />
<br />
I popped 8 or 9 goody huts and got bupkis in total. Probably the worst goody hut yield of any game so far. I think I got FOUR (4) maps of barbarian territory, TWO (2) sets of angry incompetent warriors, ONE (1) abandoned village,  ONE (1) conscript warrior way out in the boonies, and a token tech of Pottery.<br />
<br />
GL's and unit promotions were also very hard to come by, I had to send my last 4 elite warriors against the last remaining Persian spearman in a desperate attempt to get a GL before the two civs on my continent were obliterated. Got 1 GL on the last hit point of the last elite warrior and used it to build the FP in the hilly middly of west lobe of the continent to seal the fate of the world.<br />
<br />
I am going to start another thread on RESPAWNING because this occurred for me with both the babs and Persia. It is disturbing enough that I contacted INFOGRAMES live human tech support and found out that they say respawning should not be occuring.<br />
<br />
In this game, the respawning was a pain but yielded lots benefits. I just set outside the cities and killed off settler parties and harvested 2 slave workers every time. I think I ended up with about 15 or 20 slaves early on.<br />
<br />
I really enjoyed the bottleneck (isthmus) and got a chance to build the panama canal using the lake. Always have wanted to do that.<br />
<br />
I'm up to about 1400AD and at least 3-to-1 ahead points and culture. I just popped the Theory of Ev and am getting ready to build destroyers. The Germans, Japs, Eng, and Chinese are researching Magnetism. I am experimenting with cultural assaults on the far continent.<br />
<br />
Also got the thrill of about 15 turns with privateers to wreck havoc on the foreign galleys. The random number generator again kept this from being total annihilation with some attacking privateers going down to lowly galleys, but have to hope the galley contents made it worthwhile. It would be nice to have all the transport contents go through death animation before the ship actually goes down. This would be just gratuitous reward but it would help reward you for catching the transport at see before it can land its cargo of hate.<br />

They didnt have road even there yet althought they had iron working tech and why the hell they didnt build any horseman just those stupid babylonian archers.<br />
And when babylonians was taken out I started fight persians. First I sent 2 galleons with 4 spearmans total to their iron source and it wasnt protected so I easyly pillaged it but now comes the most funny thing, when I finally reached my troops persepolis there wasnt even workers building new road there...<br />

This is why I hate playing maps where almost everyone else is on a separate continent.  Whiped out the babs and persians pretty easily with a warrior rush!  Surprising how easy those spearman are to beat with veteran and elite warriors.  Spent most of the early game in monarchy, putting just 3 warriors in each city for military police, and building libraries, temples, courthouses, marketplaces, and banks in most cities.  I have 72 cities on the home continent.  But I never got a GL, so no forbidden palace for me :mad:.   I was a little behind the others in tech, but once my golden age hit I blew right past them.  After I accessed all 8 luxuries via trade I switched over to republic since I didn't need the military police anymore.  Got everyone allied against the Chinese and was thinking of attacking Germany.  But then I started having second thoughts.<br />
<br />
I'm dependant on everyone but Japan for luxuries, yet Japan doesn't have anything for me to take (I took over a dye from Germany by culture, but still need Germany for Gems).  Elizabeth is being a royal pain in the rear because I depend on her for 3 luxuries and she's expecting 150+ gold/turn, plus 3 of my luxuries for them!  I feel like I sold my soul when I sold my tech lead for luxuries :( .  I'm thinking of attacking zulu for their gems (so I won't need Germany), but I rely on the Zulus for wine!  I made the mistake of sending my massive cavalry/war elephant army to that one dye instead of focusing on Germany earlier.  I guess I'm going to send the 30+ cavalry that was at the dye location to come from the Zulu's east (as they are finishing off the Chinese to the west), while I have my caravel fleet of cavalry attack the Zulu Gems.  In the meantime, I will try to capture some English furs by culture so I don't have to send so much money to that greedy Elizabeth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Apr 06, 2002, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm... warrior rush? Talk about lucky! The odds of a veteran warrior beating a fortified regular spearman are very low, on the order of between 10-20%. More than one warrior increases the odds, but sustaining a war around these percentages is not practical. If you managed to take more than 1 or 2 cities defended by spearmen with warriors, consider yourself *VERY* lucky. :) If it makes you feel better (and I know it doesn't), you can consider this luck as balancing out your lack of leaders. In my game of the month last month, however, I had two regular warriors fail to take out 1 regular warrior in Paris, and it probably cost me a good 1000 points in score. That's the last time I ever try the warrior gambit in a GOTM! :lol:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bamspeedy</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2002, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The odds of a veteran warrior beating a fortified regular spearman are very low, on the order of between 10-20%. More than one warrior increases the odds, but sustaining a war around these percentages is not practical.  <br />
<br />
No, It wasn't a 1 on 1 battle of 1 warrior against 1 spearman.  I always had at least 2 warriors (of veteran or above), preferably 5.  I waited outside their city, and after I got writing (which I bee-lined for with science at 100%), when I established an embassy I noticed they only had 1 spearman defending and were currently building a settler (or had just completed one, so their pop was down to 1 so they couldn't pop-rush an extra spearman).  With 1 vet, 1elite, and 3 regulars I could take out that spearman.  Using the vet first seems to have worked the best by taking some damage off of it, the regulars to maybe chip away another hit or two (after the spearman had been promoted) and the elite to finish it off.  I made sure also, that my warriors were not trying to attack from across a river or any other nasty terrain.  Of course, later I had two elite warriors fall to a regular warrior in open terrain.<br />
<br />
Remember this is Warlord level, I found quite often the AI only had 1 spearman defending it's cities instead of 2 or more like you would find on higher levels.  And no, I didn't completely kill them off with just warriors, but I did take the original capitals, and force them to re-spawn elsewhere (which, luckily also denied the persians Iron)  I wasn't worried about starting war this early because it is an easier level than I have been playing for the last couple months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I shot myself in the foot a bit this time by over-estimating the AIs. I guess I've gotten too used to the AI at harder levels and have come to rely on them as a source of money. :lol: And have come to expect them to be more aggressive than they are on Warlord.<br />
<br />
I flip flopped a bit in my approach so far because my original plan turned out to be hopeless. My early plan was to start with purely a builder approach, and to build up Persia and get her to reduce Babylon to just one city. I took Babylon's iron source with a culture squeeze to keep her military strength down. But not a chance as things worked out - Persia was passive, and the &quot;horde&quot; of Persian Immortals I was hoping to see turned out to be more like two or three of them. :lol:<br />
<br />
So I ended up taking out Persia after all, and I'm now well into a typical warmongering expansion. But I started on it a bit late. I'd have started sooner if I knew how weak the AIs would be at Warlord and that I couldn't use them against each other. :) I've almost finished converting England and Germany to the Indian way of life. I have Babylon down to four cities without having gone to war with them. Since Persia was no help in reducing Babylon, I've moved my Palace to be beside hers. I now have Babylon down to four reasonably well contained cities (without having attacked) and am trying to culture flip the three remaining non-capital ones. I want to keep Babylon &quot;polite&quot; all through the game and get her UN vote at the end.<br />

I love Aeson's Domination without a battle, that sure is a nice play!</div></div><hr />

I found they also had furs, which I didn't notice earlier.  And I culturally acquired an incense from Japan (in former China territory).  Finally got a leader, so I sent him back to the home continent to build the Forbidden Palace.  Putting in that Forbidden Palace knocked off over 400 gold/turn I had been losing to corruption.  So soon I will have 72 cities pumping out nothing but cavalry and then tanks.  I might have to build more caravel to ferry all the troops.  China and Zulu are gone.  Now I have Japan and England attacking Germany, while I settle the former China territory and prepare an assault on Japan.  It's 1550 A.D. so I don't think I have a shot at any of the early victory conditions, so I'm going for a milking game, but doubt I will be real high on the list.</div></div><hr />

Domination victory way before I wanted to trigger.  I said, I'll check it next turn, then 6 cities expanded &amp; a big doh!  This comes from the guy who made Mapstat!  Pretty ironic, eh?  Anyway, I guess I'll see where I stack up, hope it leaves me a shot at an early victory - not that I can compete with Aeson though... :) even more so since I wasn't trying to finish it quickly.<br />
<br />
Actually, I outscored my GOTM05, which I also won, so that's pretty sad.<br />
<br />
Built every wonder (up to the point where the game ended) except the Oracle, Great Wall &amp; Great Library, since I don't really like the first 2 &amp; always had the tech lead.  I used Monarchy until the last few turns and kept a 3-4 tech lead.<br />
<br />
Playing Warlord was pretty tough on the boredom factor for me, I'm used to Emporer.  However, it was so so refreshing to play with a slow tech pace.  Ancient units had a long lifespan!  I almost built a chariot!  This is one of my bigger beefs with the game, tech pace increases with difficulty.  It should be mod-able though.  Anyone know a good one to fix this?<br />
<br />
GL generation was pretty frustrating for me.  I think it's too random!  I counted 17 elite victories before the 1st (that's ok).  I used him to make the Heroic Epic.  Then it took 29 more to generate a second!  (that was my count, there could've been more)<br />
<br />
I then won 8 more while already having the leader, used the leader (JS Bach), then got another on the next victory!  Does anyone know if leader chances get used while you already have one?  I don't believe it's a random number but a seeding.  Nevermind, I guess it'd be impossible to tell.<br />
<br />
With the long stretch, I had to build the FP myself, in a 3-shield town, but got it in an ok spot just a little east of where the Babs started.  Didn't need all the extra productive cities, but it really helped the empire.<br />
<br />
My domination was by military.  First the Babs, then the Persians.  Had the Lighthouse, so I found a connectable spot above the Persians.  Beat the Chinese, Zulu, &amp; Japanese.  A few turns later, victory, yeah :rolleyes: .  Anyway, I can return to normal life now, I guess.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if I could give anything more away, since this time it's a race...<br />
<br />
Edit: I was just reading in the Strategy Forum about building a FP close to the capital &amp; rushing a new Palace when you get your leader.  What a great (and simple) strategy!  Might've helped me here, except I would've had 1 less leader to use, not that it mattered on Warlord...</div></div><hr />

The great iron war has ended in 210 ad. The babs have been reduced to one city falling prey to the the Indian horseman forces and losing 10 cities. :splat:  Think this is probably one of the first times i engaged in major war so early, but i had to have some iron. One bab city could see the writing on the wall and culture flipped :egypt: Now have 33 cities to 12 for the persians who have less culture than a sterile petri dish.[dance] Little hesitant toward taking on the persians who have the immortals bouncing around. :confused: However they did build the pyramids which makes them kind of attractive :enlighten Adjusting to warlord has been a bit of a trick after playing on the higher levels, perhaps leading one to be over cautious in approach. :egypt:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Started out by building infrastructure in my Capital, letting it get to around size 5 with the worker developing the wheat.  Basically let me crank out settlers pretty quick.  Settled the choke-point, and noticed there was still a lot of free space up north, so settled the west coast there as well.  Built horsemen, and convinced the Persians to help me take out the Babylonians.  All over very quickly.  I regrouped, and then attacked the Persians.  Was pleasantly surprised how easy this was - managed to attack the immortals pre-emptively in the open, rather than letting them attack me.<br />
<br />
Started building up the entire continent, whilst the Great Lighthouse helped with my exploration - I sold contact with the Persians to everyone the same turn that I wiped them out  :lol: Steadfastly refused to sell anyone my map, but selling luxuries got me up-to-date in the tech race.<br />
<br />
Went over to the english, and founded a city on the bottom of the penisula.  Loaded it up with lots of elephants and went to war (a bit prematurely, due to an unfortunate MPP that started a world-war).  Wiped out most of the english, and am now regrouping again.<br />
<br />
My main gripe is that I haven't had a single great leader, despite waging as many elite-lead unit battles as possible.  Probably around 40 or 50 now!  :mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, in brief ...<br />
<br />
  Excellent luck with 'Huts, Settler from first, tech from two others, no barbs! :D<br />
  Built lots of Warriors immediately since I got a free Settler<br />
  Found the Babs at the chokepoint, fortified it with Warriors, built maybe my 4th or 5th city there, right by the lake<br />
  Found the Persians, got Iron Working off them, saw I had no Iron, didn't worry too much as we have Elephants, started rolling out Temples and Barracks in all my lovely river cities!<br />
  Prebuilt a massive army of 48 Vet Horsemen ... and this is where I screwed up ... I made the mistake of not attacking with them :(<br />
  Got to Middle Ages, got Monotheism of Xerxes and Feudalism off Hammurabi, then beelined to Chivalry, upgraded as many Horse as I could afford (about half of them, 24 or so) and attack! attack! attack! !! I signed up with Xerxes and we attacked the Babs. Sued for Peace and got Invention - let Xerxes finish off Hammurabi. :D<br />
  At this point, I own 2/3 of the Continent, I'm in a golden age 'cos of Elephants, and upgrading 3 or 4 Horse to Elephant per turn (80 gold a pop). Now I attack Xerxes, but he already has his Immortals, and proves to be suprising difficult to beat. I take a few cities, sue for peace for gold/turn.<br />
  No f*cking leader :mad: despite many Elite wins, so I manually build the FP in an ex-Bab city with bonus grass, hills, a river and a cow. It's nearly finished - my research should soar when all those ex-Bab cities w/ Libraries come good.<br />
  It's now the 1300s, and I've made contact with all and got the World Map. I have a slight tech lead at the end of the Middle Age, and I have built all the Wonders I care about, although I missed the Sistine by 4 turns.<br />
  I've the highest score, land area, production, money and population.<br />
 I cannot be arsed with military victory. I hate the micromanagement of large maps :( I'll most likely kill Xerxes to take the whole Continent (most of which should be uncorrupt) and gun toward the SpaceShip, or maybe see if I can get a quick Culture win, perhaps burning a few enemy capitals on the way. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Managed a cultural victory (100K+) in 1808 AD, which I guess isn't that good, however I didn't go to war at all (the only units I ever fought were barbs), and I only actually built about 10 military units for the whole game.  Inherited most of my military from defecting cities, but never used it anyway.<br />
<br />
Final score = 1777 which seems very low, but then it was warlord.<br />

<br />
anyway....<br />
<br />
<br />
didnt get any luck from huts - no settlers, i think i got pottery and then just maps and barbs - at least non of my warriors died from barbs<br />
<br />
i dont know if this iron respawned but i claimed some iron just past the chokepoint, right by the ivory, so no resourse probs for me.<br />
<br />
i went for total expansion, sending settlers (with spearmen) beyond Babylon cities to settle behind them where they had not filled.<br />
<br />
just as the free space was running out, babylon declared war on me - i had no military other than spearmen in the cities that were in effect in babylon terriory, so i paid persia some techs, my map and gold per turn to declare war on babylon.<br />
<br />
To my delight, the persians rolled through babylon raising on the way, so i filled in the newly made gaps<br />
<br />
the persian made peace when the babs were down to around 7 or 8 cities<br />
<br />
i had done nothing in the war at this stage, so the babs would not make peace with me<br />
<br />
i had by now gathered a small force of swordsmen and horsemen - Prob 5 Swords and 3 Horse - so i took the three bab cities nearest the choke point (claiming the remaining horses on the continent) and the sued for peace taking two more bab cities and leaving them with 2<br />
<br />
with no leader and not fancying a war with persia who i could see had droves of immortals i built my FP manually around the middle of the left half of the continent. I easily became tech leader and was able to bridge the gap to new lands once i had the great lighthouse   <br />
<br />
i missed the oracle and great wall but have all other wonders<br />
<br />
<br />
having discovered the world map, i noticed a large unsettled area in the northeast of the continent, where the japs were - i assume most of their cities were raised so i started colonising this area - I also got 4 cities on the southern tip by england which has earned me gems through culture.<br />
<br />
this colonisation delayed my attack on persia due to not building up an army, so i decided to wait until cavalry<br />
<br />
<br />
however, no saltpeter<br />
<br />
persia had colonised the little island south of my contient, but the saltpeter square was conveniently available so i plopped a settler on it and a harbour later i was in business.<br />
<br />
i have just finished taking over my whole contient and am continuing to colonise the north east of the larger landmass<br />
<br />
persia still exists on the small island south of my contient, but the babs are no more<br />

still not sure how i will win, the victory is certain now.</div></div><hr />

I have the english down to just their capital (a former German city, of Koningsberg or something like that).  I have a unit  fortified on every single square that their citizens could work, and pillaged it.  So, they will be starved down to one.  From what I can tell, their military is down to 2 rifleman (in their city), 3 man of wars, and 1 ironclad.  They had been landing a unit on my land, but their unit keeps dissapearing, probably having to be disbanded since they can't support their military with cash at 0 :lol:.  Hopefully their navy will disappear, too, since my navy only consists of 18 transports.<br />
<br />
I have 184 cities (might add another city or two within my culture borders) and exactly the number of tiles before domination.  If mapstat is correct, then just 1 more tile and I will trigger domination.  I have settled the former chinese, zulu, and Japanese lands.  I am calling the vast emptiness of the southern large continent 'no man's land'.  I have to place a unit every 3 or 4 squares so no barbs pop up.  I eventually plan on pillaging all the former terrain improvements and making 'no man's land' one big forest/jungle with a single pathway of railroads going through it, or maybe set up colonies on every resource and luxury in the jungle/forest.  What happens if barbs attack a colony?<br />
<br />
I was thinking of going all the way to 2050 A.D. without getting into the modern era, but I think I may need those mass transits, and the Cure for Cancer and Longevity wonders.  Otherwise there would be no point to getting to the modern age.  Also, thinking of a very late game switch to Communism (after I have everything rush bought!), so I can benefit from the 4 military police instead of 3 in monarchy.</div></div><hr />

All is going well, I am building Universal Suffrage and other wonders, and then....<br />
<br />
I get attacked by the Persians. This normally is not a big deal, but the fact that I had been buttering them up all game to have them leave me alone, only to see this, really pissed me off. And I was not in any shape for a war. I was rushing for a tech development to update all of my military units. The only advanced military I had were cavalry and riflemen. So I had a war along my border with persia. They defeated and burned three of my cities to the ground. DAMNIT! I managed to pull almost everyone into the game against them, and then Germany pulled me into a war with the English. Fortunately, the English had a shoddy military at best, so the cities I lost on the Persian front, I gained on the British front. I almost closed the gap between my two colonies on the coast. I managed to sue for peace with the English and gain two more cities, and I got peace with the Persians and replanted Settlers where my former burned down cities were. This was total surprise, and it ruined my plans, but I did NOT RELOAD, like a good civ player! :-)<br />

So I am rushing to get the technology I need to get Modern Armor and then the Persians and the British are the first to go. Total annihilation is the only acceptable end to them burning down my cities!

Still overestimated the AI though, expected the AI to take the tech lead thru trading and went all money. Turned out to be a mistake<br />
<br />
Sent out a warrior to scout right away and found the babs. Traded the one tech they had and I didn't. Declared war and took their lonesome worker. This was very early in the game and it slowed them down even more than I hoped for. Babs started making their UU and sending it over to me instead of expanding. I just build some archers and waited for them. Killed a few bab units and they asked for peace. Had found the persians who were more of a treath having 2 iron sources and immortals. I sent in an army of archers and took one of the iron cities and destroyed two other cities. Got peace, attacked the babs and allied with the persians in this war. Persians ended up killing the respawned babs. My reinforcements killed the Persians afterwards. Finally got to do some backstabbing on the AI instead of the other way around :) That really made me feel good!<br />
<br />
So at the end of the wars (beginning of the AD's ) I had the whole island, NO gl :(, all wonders except great lib and great wall. Both weren't of any interest to me. After completing the lighthouse (should have done that way earlier) I searched for the other civs. Ran into the Chinese first and met other civs. <br />
<br />
I was one tech behind the civs on the other island, which really amazed me. They researched 5 civs to 1 (me) and i was on full money at the start of the game. SHould have gone tech straight away!`<br />
<br />
Spent a few hundred years building horsemen and galleys and researching till chivalry. When i reached chivalry I upgraded the horsemen and sent them over to China. Stupid Mao refused to pay tribute so I attacked him. IN a quick war I took/destroyed two thirds of his cities. Got peace and got the rest. Decided to go for conquest vic. Still hoping to get a GL to build FP in old bab/persian territories. The rest of the game shouldn't take to long, probably finish next weekend when I can play again.<br />
<br />
Warlord is quite something different than emperor lvl combined with the occasional deity. I had never expected to keep up in tech being 1 against 5 o/w I would have played differently but that's what keeps the GOTM interesting.<br />

I really, really like the starting position!!!<br />
<br />
I moved Delhi southeast from the start point to get a few extra grassland tiles.<br />
<br />
Built Bombay west along the river in the grasslands.  This turned out to be my most productive city.  Built the Pyramids, Sistine Chapel &amp; JS Bach's Cathedral there.<br />
<br />
Like everybody else, I had no iron.  I built horsemen and attacked Babylon.<br />
<br />
I was the first to map making.  I immediately started building the Great Lighthouse.  I also began exploring like a mad man.  I lost many ships, but I eventually met China :) <br />
<br />
About this time, a lot happened at once.  I finished off Babylon, met the other civs, masterd chivalry, and finished the Great Lighthouse.  I immediately started to do two things.<br />
1.  Built War Elephant attack force for Persia<br />
2.  Started ferrying Settlers and War Elephants to the other continent.<br />
<br />
Persia was no match for my War Elephants.  Was I had enough stockpiled strategically near their cities, I attacked 3 different cities all at once.  It was a well fought battle, but they were wiped out.  Persia and Babylon never met the other continent's civs.<br />
<br />
I used the Jungle area between England and Japan to get a foothold established on the new continent.  Once I had enough forces, I attacked England.  Germany joined in, and England was gone very quickly.<br />

I have built my Forbidden Palace on the new continent, with a Great Leader.  I hope to use this area to stage my onslaught of the new continent.</div></div><hr />

Germany and England got into it, and so too did Japan. Then Persia got in the mix, and started in on Germany. So what did I do? I loaded up my Galleons with Settlers and Infantry and built cities in the large empty swaches of territory left where all of the &quot;torched&quot; cities once were. I had the benefit of previously improved terrain, and I was able to plant cities near enemy border cities and have them flip over because of my high culture rating. I am currently in the early 1800s, and I am one tech away from modern age, over-all culture is in the high 70,000, and my most cultured city, Delhi, is at about 7,500 in culture. I might be able to get a cultural victory here! At least I am hoping.<br />
<br />
In the mean time, I continue to rob the other competitors of their money with my luxury exports, and I am getting their cities to flip to my civ, left and right. Very nice indeed. <br />
<br />
I am beginning to manufacture Tanks like crazy in an effort to invade Persia. Anybody know how to get a civ to get rid of a Mutual Protection Pact once it has expired? The Chinese have ganged up with the Persians so it is preventing me from attacking them. Any suggestions will help!<br />

At the bottom, there is the &quot;New&quot; and &quot;Active&quot; buttons at the bottom.  Go to the &quot;active&quot; one.  You'll see your expired MPP, just click on it.  You can renew or get rid of it from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My problem is that i don't like attacking other civs too much, so since no-one has attacked me i haven't fought a single battle, and from looking around the world map, i don't think anyone has for any great period of time.<br />
<br />
I expanded quickly grabbed the iron then surrounded &amp; squeezed the babs &amp; persians with culture. I only flipped about 4 cities from them despite having about 4 times the culture of both together.<br />
<br />
I stuffed up the forbidden palace because i'm not fighting i ain't got any GL's so i started building 1 slowly during my golden age (60 turns or so) after the age finished i had 150 odd turns to go, i left it ended up building a courthouse and starting the forbidden palace again :P and now it's gonna take 40 turns. oh well better late than never.<br />
<br />
I've built all wonders except the Oracle &amp; Hanging gardens. After building the Lighthouse i've been flooding settlers into every gap i can find on the larger continent. (Like other i thought pangea maps meant all the land was connected) But i've managed to secure all 8 luxuries with 0 fighting. I was lucky to get a english city flip to give me easy gems, but i was about to squeeze it out through culture anyway. Just about to discover navigation to connect the last luxuries. Then I'll switch back to 100% tech (been at 20% while getting tech through GL, and rushing temples everywhere!) Then it'll be a few more settlers to fill in the few gaps left and milking the last 300 turns or so. (Hope i make it by the end of the month :) milking takes me sooo long)<br />
<br />
<br />
I've had VERY funny experiences with the culture flipping, and it's just too random for my liking.<br />
<br />
In the early game of the 4 cities that flipped, some of them were only 4-5 squares from their capital. Then other places where i've squeezed cities to a few squares and they are 15+ squares from capital they don't flip. Also i had a city flip against me to CHINA!!! I'm a republic with 10 times the culture and the city was 14 squares away from their capital, and it had a temple and had about 40 culture itself. I've got cities about 6 squares from the chinese capital and these cities are fine. I just don't get it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Apr 10, 2002, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm.... okay. I &quot;won&quot; the GOTM some time ago and have been building score just below the domination threshold. On the last turn, China moved a stack of some 20 swordsmen into my territory. They are currently getting 4 luxuries from me, 2 of those FOR FREE, plus 35g/turn for free and a ROP. I have never fought them and we have been polite the whole game. &quot;We have a strong miltary compared to them!&quot; says the military advisor. So... what is Mao thinking? :mad: Whenever I think I have the AI figured out, they do something like this...<br />
<br />
Not like it matters (as if any other civ on warlord could even take a city from me ;)) but a war could hurt my score... and I disbanded 50 cavalry earlier because I saw no need... :o  but my economy can easily pump out 3 or 4 just on rush buys every turn. If China attacks, they will pay in blood with the razing of all nearby cities. It might make it harder for me to win diplomatically though :(<br />
<br />
I'll post later on what happens :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

Well last night I got the world map so now can finally see how everyone is doing!! My first trireme went east and and died but my second going north survived... :D<br />
<br />
Anyways am only just in the AD's, and in a good position to go for a few victory types... don't have the patience for moving hundreds of units and cities so that rules out domination and conquest... think I might go for spaceship to see what happens, I still haven't completed a Civ3 game, I usually play on Monarch or Emperor and get bored once its certain I'm going to win... :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
But seeing this was Warlord took a risky civ1/2 strategy of just expand, expand, expand, expand, expand... managed to kill the Babs with some elite warriors and two or three vet archers real earlier, then just totally pushed west as hard as I could towards the Persians... and just managed to grab the iron on the edge of my borders... sweet. Built my Forbidden Palace one city to the west of the original capital, then flipped the Palace over to Nineveh in the centre of the west part of the island and right on the Persians borders. Got Colossus &amp; Great Lib in the same turn (the Zulus beat me to Pyramids by *one* turn :mad: ) which triggered my GA... useful for building lots of granaries... :rolleyes: ... am just in a republic and the middle ages now saving money and building units in preparation to clear my island which will happen in the next few hundred years methinks... have one militia in each city, build a few horsies, get Leonardoes and then upgrade... cut the Persians iron and it'll be all over red rover. :D<br />
<br />
Then libraries, unis, copernicus &amp; newtons in my three gold mountains/river science city should rocket my science ahead to an early space race... stay tuned... :cool: <br />
<br />
Continued... tried initially to go max gold and rely on Great Library but the other civs were SOOOOO slow I soon gave up on this idea and researched everything myself... Lenoardos &amp; SunTzu took me so long to build (and researching was so quick) that I went straight to cavalry and bypassed elephants... wiped out the Persians in a few short turns with about 20 cav... eat that immortals. Did have a minor prob, had to build the Great Lighthouse to connect the saltpeter on the island, so that let the Persians live a few more turns...<br />
<br />
After the Persians died, researched everything at 4 turns and launched the spaceship in 1754AD. Could have done much better I think if I had done all research myself from the beginning rather than overestimated the AI as others have, but nevermind (this was my lowest level game... started playing Civ3 on regent and only played that once as too easy).<br />
<br />
Had a minor hiccup, two turns before my LAST spaceship component tech was due, my uranium source required to build it runs out, so I had to give the civs on the other continent all the technologies bootstrapping them ALL the way through the industrial age and to fission, so I could trade uranium from them. And they still were only polite rather than gracious after I gave them all the industrial age technologies!!!!!<br />
<br />
One city had 3 gold mountains and Copernicus, Newtons, SETI, was cranking 200+ beakers... another point was I had to sell all my temples about 1500AD, when I did finish I was on about 80,000 culture, could have got culture victory earlier than spaceship if I tried, and thats without any culture-producing colonies on the other continent. Culture vic is too easy on the low levels with a big civilisation!!<br />
<br />
I'd be interested to hear any other spaceship lauch dates/strategies...</div></div><hr />

<br />
As soon as i had galley i made search, for another continents, soon found it and trade map.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, i will probably won'T finish the game since it took me WAY to many time just to play 20 turn, because i am now building ****  New Dehli 5 ****<br />
i was inspired by aeson dense building technique, it seem to work for me at warlord i didn'T build any unit, except settler, worker, galley, caravel ( and except some to take care of babylonian and persian...)<br />
<br />
But because of all those Citys each turn it takes a while just to change production and everything, turn are VERY VERY SLOW,<br />
<br />
But i enjoyed, the game and learned a little bit more what i should do when *dense building*<br />
<br />
does it matter if i submit my game even if not finished?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phillip_martin</div><div class="date">Apr 11, 2002, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my first post and my second GOTM (the first was last month's which with a bit of luck was a moderate score spaceship win :) . The whole GOTM concept is enhancing my recent purchase of CIVIII by providing tips and strategies in a friendly competetive way. Great site :goodjob: . Like many others I will not be actively milking a game due to time and patience so the fastest awards will be my goal.<br />
<br />
As for this game.......<br />
<br />
The BC time was spent blocking off the chokepoint, building infrastructure and an elephant army to take over the second part of the continent. I was surprised to get all of the early Wonders except for the pyramids. The invasion started around 10AD which meant I forgot about the save game until 110AD (hope that's OK Matrix ???) and started with the Babs and then moved onto the Persians. During this war I discovered the other continent via the Chinese side and started to establish contact without letting on about my war. Finished of the Persians with one GL and a manual build of my FP in Babylon.<br />
<br />
By this time I knew the layout of the other Civs and had my first major decision for my end game. Consolidate by cranking up my tech which had been running around 50-60% to go for a space race, diplomatic or cultural win, or continue to feed my bloodlust. After the previous GOTM my dark side won and I decided on the English as they were closer to my more productive side and they had left a blank area which I quickly planted with a city.<br />
<br />
Many trips later I had a large elephant army poised....... and then the Chinese declared war folowed by the Japanese with whome they had a MPP! Ignoring the sabre rattling and quietly discounting a diplomatic victory I declared war on the English and prepared for the Chinese invasion............. which never came???<br />
<br />
On the outskirts of London the Germans who I had been buttering up to leave me alone declared war along with the Zulus at a later date. So I was at war with everyone in the 16th Century!! Time to get those diplomatic skills into gear. The Japanese and Zulus after a few turns finally listened to my call and made peace without firing a shot. The Chinese accepted a peace offer of the one city I took on their mainland. The English puzzled me??? I was sitting on their strategic resources with their capital under my control and they would not give me any other city in a peace deal.<br />
<br />
With my GL I rushed my palace over to London to bring this continents cities under resonable control. At this stage with Sun Tzu's my elephant army was being converted into Cav and felt confident of concentrated on the English while holding the Germans at bay.<br />
<br />
The Germans did cause me some pain. The first example was their assault on a hilly border town of mine which threatened their saltpetre. Instead of mindlessly throwing cav units one by one at my fortified elephants they managed to raise all surrounding tiles (My elephants were just about to become cav) and took it with a rush. The second was when a veteran German cav destroyed my fortified “City Buster” cav army (7 out of 12 hit points available) which was created with my only other GL produced :(.<br />
<br />
It is now 1640 and I have finished off the English with the game at another major decision point. The Chinese, Japanese and Zulus are now in awe of my culture. The must also be in awe of my millitary as they declared war on the English (soon after I made peace with them) and the Germans. I now have hordes of units making their way past me on a mission to raise German cities.<br />
<br />
Do I -<br />
Consolidate.    Make peace with Germany and let the other civs clear a swathe of ex-German land for my settlers which I should then churn out. Switch my Government from Communism to Democracy and focus on keeping ahead in tech and keeping my nose clean. Victory options: Culture or Diplomacy if I can put all my excess resources to use and make the other civs forget our differences. I may have left my run too late for an early space race win.<br />
<br />
World Domination.   Stay in Communism. Possibly make peace with Germany to keep them alive longer to fight the other civs. Focus on building a millitary force and try and catch one of the other civs with the majority of their force a long way from home down in ex-German land. Focus on getting tanks ASAP. Victory options: Total Annihilation if I burn or Domination if I don’t.<br />
<br />
Hmmmmmm, I suppose I should check what my score is..........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pnp_dredd</div><div class="date">Apr 11, 2002, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok heres my stury briefly. After I built the first 4 cities I was like OMG look at all that potential food, and I decided there and then to go for an early cultural victory. <br />
<br />
I ditched everything and just went for wholesale expansion. Lucky I found no barbs for quite some time, and that was on the other side of the choke point. The most any of my cities are built apart is three squares, and thats only where food resources/mountains made building them closer not advantageous. Most are 2 spaces in a nice grid formation. Through some micro management you can get 3 cities using 4 food squares quite well, and churning out settlers.<br />
<br />
I built the main settler producing cities quickely near the food resources, and then started putting cities everywhere they would fit. These cities built a warrior, then a temple rushed, then a library rushed (went straight for litrature). The other cities continued to churn out settlers.<br />
<br />
Im not sure if I wouldnt have been better to fit a temple in these cities at some stage, as that culture doubling coupled with the decreasing speed of each turn (in years) means that an early temple is a culture machine!<br />
<br />
So anyway I had almost completely filled my little slice of the continent with cities before I even found the choke point. So I have no iron, but I dont see this as a big problem. During the lull between libraries and colleseums I built a horseman army and took over the persians, mainly in order to get a great leader.<br />
<br />
Who never came :(<br />
<br />
No barracks, so no vet units. In fact I didnt even make an elite horseman. So no forbidden palace for me :(<br />
<br />
I will be in Despotism till the end of the game I think to take advantage of pop rushing. I cant see myself ever getting to communism, as I have switched off science after getting cathedrals.<br />
<br />
The problem now is micro managing all of my cities to keep GOLD even. I only have about 200 spare, and with all the temples/libraried/cols/caths still coming online from my settler farms I will have a real cashflow problem. Babs are paying a bit of tribute for techs etc, but they cant afford much.<br />
<br />
Its about 500 AD and I have cracked the 20K culture mark, and with the exponential curve I have created (new cities all the time, and temple/library doubling) it should be a cultural win only a little past 1000 AD.<br />
<br />
Assuming of course that I dont go completely insane from micro management of tax collectors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 11, 2002, 04:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm done and placed one of my best games! :yeah: GOTM IV (English, emperor) was the best and this is my second best.<br />
<br />
Of course, once you find out you're alone with one or two others, you simply need to wipe those out. I did this successfully, before they even met someone else, so all the treaties I've broken don't care at all. ;)<br />
<br />
Then I developed, developed and developed. At a certain time I could't build anything else but cavalry, so I did that. When I have a very lot of them I tried to invade China. It only gave me two cities and a couple of angry faces (the others). So I didn't try that anymore. But when I got modern armor and mech inf, I tried again, and they were wiped out in a blink of an eye; at least at their home land. I made a right of passage agreement with the Zulus and simply continued the tour (cos the English had a mutual protection pact with the Chinese) and before I knew it they only had some silly meanlingless bunch of cities left. And when the game ended (cultural victory), the English were destoyed and China had one city left (near Germany).<br />
<br />
I conquered/destroyed more than half of the other continent, but it was only because I had too much production and found it a shame just to get more and more money. So that's why I started that war. When I saw the replay I was actually amazed what a production left-over is able to do. :lol: I also didn't want to get a conquest game, though it appeared I could easily do that. I guess warlord is pretty easy. ;)<br />

<br />
Here's an idea for you.  I don't think you can make the others break their MPP.  What you could try to do is make a MPP with the Civ you want on your side.  It may cost you, but once you have it, invade the other Civ.  Its pretty sneaky, but I believe it will drag the other into war with you.  I know this works, because it happened to me in GOTM4.  Although, I was the one dragged into war!<br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Make sure the first attack of the war is against you, on your own soil.  This will bring the 3rd civ in on your side.  If you are the aggressor, the 3rd civ will declare war on you.  You can declare war freely and not trigger any MPP's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babble-on</div><div class="date">Apr 11, 2002, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My Cultural war is really paying off now. All of the small settlements I planted on the larger continent have been snatching away cities from other civilization, at least every third or fourth turn. My total cultural value is up aroun 87,000, and my most cultured city is at about 8100. I am in the middle 1800's already in the modern age, and I am working on fusion. I managed to get my neighbor Persia to shut the &quot;f&quot; up by making a &quot;Maginot&quot; line across our border of fortresses and tanks on every square, with one little hole for them to come through (of course I have 14 tanks piled just two squares away from the funnel hole in case they still are tempted to invade with their calvalry)<br />
<br />
On the global scene, England got cocky and has been reduced to one city on a small island near the southern part of the larger continent. Everyone is warring against everyone BUT me, thankfully. And I am peddling my luxuries to the entire world to suck them of their cash. Here is my expansion theme: I build a settler and an infantry unit and send them to a place between two enemy cities where there is still room. I settle near some grasslands and hopefully near a resource. I immediately set to build temple. On the next turn, I hurry the prodution of the temple (usually around 104 gold) and then I set to build library. By two or so turns, the city has expanded its cultural influence and pushed the borders out into the two competing civ's cities. (In essence you are pushing them to either join you, or starve) Once I build Library I try for Cathedral. usually in about ten or so turns, they flip to me unless they are a really large city. I have so far flipped about 14 cities from other civs. I even managed to take a size 12 city from the Zulus and a size 10 city from the Chinese on the main continent simply by using culture.<br />
<br />
If I start war, it will be to either take out the Persians, or to take Berlin from the Germans (They have Shakespear Theatre and Hanging Gardens - nice additions to the rest of the Wonders I have)<br />
<br />
I hope to submit my entry within a week. Too bad I can't just take a whole day to play it out to the end. I honestly don't think I will even make it to see 2000 because of the high culture score - I am predicting a victory by the early 1900s<br />
<br />
This is a great builder GOTM!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babble-on</div><div class="date">Apr 11, 2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fantastic idea for the MPP. I have to bribe the hell out of China to get an MPP with them, and then get Persia to attack me, That way Persia will be fighting from both fronts! I love it!:goodjob:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Apr 11, 2002, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, there is no easy way to determine your culture per turn. The game only lists your total for the whole civ on the F5 culture screen. However, instead of tediously counting up the amount from each city, you can just record your culture for one turn, then on the next turn subtract the previous turn amount to get your culture/turn. For example, if you had 70000 culture in 1850AD, and 71000 in 1852AD (the next turn), you're obviously generating 1000/turn. <br />
<br />
In my game, I'm accumulating too MUCH culture. I just spent an HOUR having to go into each city and sell off my cultural improvements in order to avoid a cultural victory before 2050 hits. It was pretty boring :o, but goes to show how your goal for the game determines what is a &quot;good&quot; sign versus a &quot;bad&quot; one. :cool:<br />
<br />
Another thing: when dealing out my retribution attack against China, I moved a stack of some 15 cavalry next to one of their cities. On the next turn I get the message &quot;Hangchow wants to join our civ!&quot; :lol: I was going to burn the city to the ground on that very turn; looks like they saw the writing on the wall! :king:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rain</div><div class="date">Apr 11, 2002, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well to continue from my last post. The Persians and Babylonions were completely destroyed by 700 AD. The history books have been revised to reflect that they never existed :egypt: I didnt find the other continent til 1000 ad mainly from not trying to hard i guess. When i found the rest of the civs they were hopelessly backward. I was doing some peaceful cultural intrusion and preparing to demolish China when out of the blue the english declared war on me which was a riot since my closest city to them (aside from across the water which they didnt know how to cross) was at the opposite end of the contintent. Liz had been working on this for sometime since 15 units of english swordsmen and spearmen popped out of china and it must have taken them a hundred years to get there. Anyway i destroyed the english army and got the other civs except China to attack england for a few spare luxuries. So much for that war. While they were all scrapping i declared war on china and took most of their cities before my pop went to 83% war weariness. So i made peace and filled up all the empty spots with settlers. Soon i'll be a full era ahead of the ai in tech so mopping up will be easy, then its just doing the best re score one way or another.<br />
<br />
Addendum :<br />
<br />
Well its not quite over but its just a matter of shuffling workers now. The world consists of India and 2 German cities ( 7 tiles from domination).  May never make it to mod era since i gave up researching tech quite awhile ago so i could rush ducts/mps and hosps in overseas cities and i still have 2 techs to go.  I will grow the score til my wonders flip a cultural win ( sold off everything else long ago). One interesting thing was selling the uni's and libs didnt affect research much ( maybe 4 turns). My error was not selling off my culture soon enough  and i dont think i can make it to 2050 before i hit the cultural threshold. I suspect a very early cultural win would have been possible in this game since i wasnt pushing it and 1500 ad would have been possible. I tried to stay mobilized during wars just to cut down culture. <br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see the results for other folks  :egypt:</div></div><hr />

Warp technology anyone?<br />
<br />
As for the culture thing, I calculate it the same way that the previous poster demonstrated. Keep in mind that if you don't lose any cities and if you are building more and more, your culture per turn rating will just increase as your city improvements get older and more culturally valuable. That is why it is so important to get those temples built fast and early in the game. My most culturally valuable building is the temple in Delhi...<br />
<br />
Oh, and if you want to gauge your cultural progres, there is a pull down menu option in the histograph that allows you to show culture comparison to the other civs.</div></div><hr />

Finally signed a peace treaty in exchange for ROP and a MPP (I have to protect England from barbarians :lol: ).  England's last city is a size 1 entertainer city and has just the two rifleman left in their whole military.  They were making 2 gold/turn in Monarchy (1 for science, 1 for treasury).  After the war, they switched to Democracy.  So now they have to pay for those 2 rifleman, so no money for science or treasury!!:lol: <br />
<br />
They spent the 20 turns of peace building a longbowman.  Peace treaty came up (forgot about it), so I didn't have the option to renew the ROP, so I had to declare war again, so I could keep my units there.  So that Longbowman died when trying to attack a cavalry.  They refuse to acknowlege my envoy, even though I have 20 units surrounding their city!<br />
<br />
My score seems pitiful, but it is an easier level and smaller map than I normally play, so I have no idea if my score is good or not.  My milking phase of the game hasn't been real efficient, so I'm sure SirPleb and others will beat me, but I should still get kind of high on the list.</div></div><hr />

It's funny what the AI does when reduced to 1 city.It sure is! I've finished my game and am just writing it up, will post later. I had some very strange things happen this time with one of my captive Civs. Babylon kept wanting war, 4 times in total during the milking phase. At least 3 of those times it was a few turns after a renegotiation of peace. I haven't had that problem before, it sure is strange. I had thought that they were always reluctant to go to war within the 20 turns of a signed peace agreement but that definitely was not true this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirPleb</div><div class="date">Apr 11, 2002, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's how my game went this month:<br />
<br />
I started out thinking &quot;Pangaea with 7 rivals - should be perfect for a tricky Diplomatic win, lots of Civs in one large area, should be able to get one of them attacked by everyone else, then save that one to vote for me at the end.&quot; (Hah!)<br />
<br />
The start position looked great for a fast build, even better as more of the area became visible. I didn't want to hit any rival early on. So I didn't explore much at the start, I focused on building quickly and expanding. I only opened 3 goody huts - one gave a tech, the other two had barbarians.<br />
<br />
I met Babylon and Persia and started thinking that we could be on an island. By about 1000BC I'd settled most of the starting area (east of the chokepoint) and had started the first Galley on exploring the coast. I started building in the Babylonian/Persian area, to culture squeeze Babylon's iron out of her hands and to limit her expansion. I wanted a strong Persia to attack Babylon. I gave away all tech, intending to speed the pace of research, so that I could go for the space race if my diplomatic win plan failed.<br />
<br />
I built the Lighthouse in 470BC. (It sure was possible to build up quickly on this map!) Some turns later I met the English, and through them all the other Civs. Sure didn't look like a Pangaea map! I had a vague hope (unfounded as things turned out) of China and Japan reducing the Zulu to rubble later on when Chivalry was available. I continued freely trading for tech and giving it away. At this point (when I saw most of the map) I probably should have switched to my backup space race plan, the whole game would have gone easier. But I stubbornly kept deciding to stick to my goal of a high score Diplomatic win. :lol:<br />
<br />
I eventually built Pyramids (no one else was making any good progress on them :) ) around 300AD to trigger a Golden Age. Shortly after that I had some Elephants ready for action. I got tired of waiting for Persia to attack Babylon. I shouldn't have tried to strengthen Persia for this, it just wasn't working. So my Elephants went off to conquer Persia.<br />
<br />
The hordes of Immortals I'd hoped Persia would send against Babylon were a pushover, all two or three of them. :lol: I captured all towns instead of a raze+replace approach, and continued that throughout the game. India's culture was much greater than that of all other Civs combined. This approach worked fine - I didn't have even one captured city flip back during the entire game.<br />
<br />
The second time I won a fight with an elite a great leader appeared! Since no one else was going to reduce Babylon for me, and I still (stubbornly) wanted her for my &quot;friend&quot; at the end, I'd decided to try to reduce Babylon to one city through a culture squeeze. This leader would allow me to move India's Palace right away. I switched one of the core cities beside Delhi to build Forbidden Palace. Once it was built I used the leader to move the Palace to be right beside Babylon's Palace. At this point Babylon had 5 cities in addition to her capitol. Over the following years I built towns at the borders of all of them and rushed cultural improvements in those towns. Despite the enormous resulting cultural pressure, it took about 150 turns before all five of the Babylonian cities had finally flipped to India.<br />
<br />
After eliminating Persia my Elephants set sail for England. (I'd given Chivalry to the other Civs, still hoping to send Japan and China to war with their Samurai and Riders. So attacking them at this stage seemed like a bad idea. :) ) As I began the attack on England, the Zulu declared war on Germany. A long treck through the jungle, very strange. I took all of England's cities, then all of Germany's.<br />
<br />
After taking Germany my Elephants sailed for Zululand. The Zulu were a logical target because of their fertile land, and because the only other remaining Civs had Samurai and Riders - not good units for my Elephants to fight.<br />
<br />
Around the end of the conquest of Zululand we learned Military Tradition. I shifted production to Cavalry, upgraded the remaining Elephants, and went on to raze Japan. After Japan, China. It was a long fight due to the geography, regular minor losses of my units, and the long trip from the homeland for new units. But there was no significant resistance anywhere, the Warlord AIs were weak. I left two Chinese cities at the end, both surrounded of course. I got three more leaders during all the fighting. One was lost in a counter-attack, the other two were used to build wonders.<br />
<br />
Then began a long milking phase. For a change of pace I decided to try a dense build on the large continent, to see if that would improve milking. I placed one city for every six or so tiles. The result was interesting. Unfortunately I don't think it reduced the amount of work in the milking phase. It did mean that there was no micro-management of entertainers (all working citizens were happy), and little building of Hospitals and Mass Transit. But because the cities grew at different speeds, many needed Marketplaces and some even needed Hospitals after all. It would have been possible to micro-manage them to avoid this, by reassigning working citizens frequently as they grew. But that looked like an even worse micro-management nightmare so I ended up not bothering, I just let them develop as they wanted to and added improvements where necessary. I do think that this approach increases score a bit. The dense cities grew to a maximum number of working citizens very quickly. And all working citizens being happy all the time sure helps.<br />
<br />
I didn't use the dense build on the home continent. Since most cities on the home continent were not at maximum corruption, the entertainment slider could be used to make all of those citizens happy.<br />
<br />
During the milking stage Babylon surprised me by repeatedly declaring war. I was playing this part in my usual way, renewing peace and ROP regularly, and gifting something every 10 turns. Nonetheless Babylon declared war four times! I might have missed one of my &quot;nice&quot; turns the first time, I'm not sure. But the other three times I am sure I'd been careful. Each of those times a recent peace agreement was in effect. In all four &quot;wars&quot; I just ignored Babylon, eventually got peace, and then quickly got relations back to &quot;polite&quot; with a few gifts. The last war was scary for my plans. I had planned to be especially nice in every turn from 2029 onward (thinking of the frequently magic number 20), with a gift every turn. But on the 2029 turn Babylon declared the fourth of these silly wars. Worse, this time I just couldn't get peace! I thought my diplomatic goal was toast. Finally in 2049 (!) they were willing to talk. I got peace, then gave them almost everything I could in an attempt to make them happy on the same turn as our peace agreement. (Gave maps, contact with China, every luxury, and a pile of tech.) Then I declared war on China and bought an alliance from Babylon for another few techs. Finished the 2049 turn with fingers crossed. Babylon voted for India instead of abstaining! Yay!<br />
<br />
I'm at a loss to explain Babylon's aggression during the milking phase. I've had a more aggressive Civ (Germany) bottled up in a similar way, at a higher difficulty level, without having this problem. In hindsight I have two theories: 1) Babylon and India were never at war with a common foe; our relations were not as positive as I've had when I did this the other way, &quot;saving&quot; the friend Civ. 2) Perhaps I should not have held back world maps until the end; maybe Babylon was more aggressive about busting out because there was much of the world remaining to be explored from her perspective.<br />
<br />
I ended up with a pretty good score, higher than I originally thought possible on this map at Warlord level. But it could have been higher. I made the whole game unnecessarily complicated, first of all by planning on my usual approach to a Diplomatic win (getting the other Civs to knock one Civ down and then &quot;saving&quot; it), and then by stubbornly sticking to the plan when the map and the Warlord level AI weren't really right for it. :) This map, at Warlord level, doesn't turn out to be a good case for differentiating Diplomatic wins from high score games.<br />
<br />
I played a bit with government switching in this game since I had a big enough power margin to experiment. I tried Republic twice while starting a war instead of my usual choice of Monarchy. It didn't work well for me - war weariness set in sooner than I liked and I fell back to Monarchy both times before the war was over. So I am still not wild about Republic :lol: I also twice flipped from Monarchy to Despotism for just one turn right after the end of a war. I used that turn to rush temples in all the cities captured in the preceding war. I'm going to use that trick again in future when playing as a religious Civ, it gives quite a nice boost in the right circumstances.</div></div><hr />

finally i researched chivalry, upgraded my horsemen-army to elephants and taught these babylonian immortals a lesson they'll never forget :D...just as i began my conquest i built the colossus, triggering a golden age, which speeded up things even more...<br />

<br />
my story:<br />
<br />
after conquering all of the home continent i lost focus, i couldnt decide what to do next, and so i did some rather stupid stuff :D<br />
<br />
i tried to conquer the chinese, who were really big (they conquered all the zulu land)...i invaded with 40 cavalry, took 3 cities, and signed a peace treaty...after a few turns i tried to took another city, and oh boy i had no chance :) i nearly lost all my 40 cavalry before i could make peace again, and so i decided to stay with the 3 cities...<br />
<br />
so i gave up conquering for now, researched until i had tanks and went after the rather weak germans...at the same time all the other civs (china, japan, england) also declared war against germany and they were defeated within a few turns :D the cities were shared between the remaining civs, i ended up with 5 german cities...<br />
<br />
in the meantime i was building lots of libraries, cathedrals, colosseums and so on, so getting a cultural victory was only a matter of time and in 1930 it was all over :)<br />

score: 2054 lousy points ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been trying to estimate the winning score, and I doubt anyone will be able to exceed 8000 on this map. But someone out there will probably surprise me! :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir Yelof</div><div class="date">Apr 12, 2002, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in mid-game, have the whole map.  Seems most of us can start our stories the same way: expanded, secured choke point, did something to get the Iron (I managed to build there before the Babs and Persians did so no wars necessary), then eventually secure the continent (I've only had two wars -- one to wipe out the Babs and one to wipe out the Persians.  Both were swift takeovers.  Nice to be on the other side of that, as opposed to those Emperor games where you don't quite keep up....:D).  Kept moving Elite elephants to the front until I finally got that leader, built an FP and have the whole continent humming with production.  Just added factories and hospitals to all the major cities, and build every wonder I can get my hands on.<br />
<br />
Now what?  :confused: I'm hoping that I can plow through this game quickly by maximizing my continent's production/research/money.  I haven't set foot on the other continent.  I have enough elephants left over to keep the other civs deferential to me, but I've been rushing city improvements and building rather than getting an army raised for an invasion.  So I've put all workers on auto, got up to democracy, and make sure I get each new tech in 4 turns.  I guess it's a race between whether I get a diplomatic, space race, or cultural victory, since the emphasis is on time not score.<br />

I have just recently started playing at Regent Level (2 games, no wins) so I was glad to see the Warlord Game.<br />
<br />
Started out with a cultural victory in mind (not much of a warmonger) and like everyone else secured the bottleneck early.  I had just found out that the Babs had the only Iron when the Persians declared war.  I signed a military alliance with the Babs and started pumping out horsemen and spearmen.  I got to their last city just as I was able to build the War Elephant and waited until I got one up there to try and trigger a 2nd GA - got the city but no GA.  I settled down for about 100 yrs. after that then decided the Babs had to go - really wanted the Iron.  I demanded tribute and they refused so I made quick work of them with the War Elephant.<br />
<br />
Got my 2nd galley up north and started exploring.  Sent a frigate east.  No one is real happy with me - must have damaged my reputation after turning on the Babs.<br />
<br />
It's now 1500AD and I'm sitting just under 1000 pts. with the Zule and Japanese just under 500.  Everyone else is weaker.  My culture points are now going through the roof.  Not sure if I'll just ride out the culture victory or start sending units to the other continent.<br />
<br />
Anyway - enjoying everyone's posts and hope to finish my game this weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babble-on</div><div class="date">Apr 12, 2002, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This game is giving me plenty of time to experiment with a whole slew of different approaches. I love it. Oh, and the English were decimated finally, so we are down to six civs on my map. I have managed to grow out all of my colonies on the larger continent to secure two oil sources and I am working on gaining another saltpeter source via culture squeeze. I have flipped two more cities as well to my favor.<br />
<br />
Everyone is still fighting everyone else except me, and I will be victorious in about 10 turns because of my cultural score. I am at a total culture rating of about 88,000 or so and my capitol is at 8,400 cultural rating. I am seriously thinking of capturing the German capitol via sea rush. They are polite toward me, never attack me, never bother me, and would NEVER expect an attack from the sea! That city has two major cultural Wonders and I want them! Persia also has a really culturally powerful city that I want (Pasgardae) - The maginot line I built up is really helping out, and I have my sights set on pummelling the Persians and taking away at least four cities before my turn is over. In the mean time, I am taking away land from the other civs on the larger continent by planting settlements in the small strips of land left after a city is captured through war and them rushing cultural improvements in those cities. More territory gives a higher score, so I am hoping to do better than average for me...I doubt I will edge out Sir Pleb though! heheheh<br />
<br />
And my tanks are scaring the hell out of everyone on the planet... that's a good thing. :-)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dimy</div><div class="date">Apr 13, 2002, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well this was my first GOTM and I rather enjoyed it... I played Civ I for many years but didn't like Civ II a lot, Civ III however is great :). I never read any strategies hints and tips so was still figuring out the game. <br />
Warlord level was a perfect level for me to start out, the AI was about as strong as I was and I had to trade techs to keep in pace with technology. I'm not much of a warmongoner so played peacefully, I build the lighthouse and started exploring the borders of our continent and beyond... I made contact with the chinese first and got the world map from them. I noticed there was uncolonised territory between the japanese/zululand and english and found some iron and saltpeter resources which I didn't have yet (I had my cities only on the right part of the choke point and the babs had colonised the little southern island).<br />
Persia and Babylon got involved in a war and I decided to wait to see who would be the strongest party... Persia was getting the upper hand and because I didn't want them to become too strong and get control of all the western part of our continent I joined the war against the babylonians and took most of their southern cities. <br />
I landed my final assault party on the little island and captured their 2nd last city... then something stupid happend... my allies versus the babylonians, the persians, declared war to me totally by surprise (we had a ROP and alliance vs babs). <br />
They took a city from me which I recently captured from the babs and tried to take another city which was close to 3 luxuries spot...they kept attacking that city and I kept pumping defending units into that town and all border cities. Finally they gave up and we were in peace again... I immediately started building fortresses all around our border and placed infantry in them to protect the border. <br />
Meantime my cities on the other continent were thriving and many foreign cities flipped to my side... I started out with 3 cities which I found myself.... at the end of the game I had 12 cities on that continent, all by flipping :)<br />
I thought I was doing a pretty good game... on the big continent was a world war going on since the 1700's and everybody vs everybody.... the zulu's were wiped out by the chinese and japanese.... germany and england were at war but neither got the upper hand. After the zulu's were destroyed, China went on to take out the japanese. China was by far the biggest. I didn't have a strong army and they kept demanding tributes... it pissed me off, but I didn't want to risk a war with them since I would certainly loose my cities on that continent. I managed to keep peaceful relations with all other civs and eventually won the space race in 2009 AD. My score was 1463.... <br />
<br />
Well... after submitting my game I started reading this thread and saw so many new ideas and strategies.... so I replayed the game (just for fun, not for the GOTM of course).<br />
this time I got rid of the babs in 1050BC and the persians in 320AD. The English were destroyed by the germans and japanese... and the chinese, zulu, japanese and myself took out the germans. In the meantime I could already build tanks (all other civs just got cavalery) and landed a party of 40 tanks on the big continent (I had 4 cities there myself at that time). I build an airport in one of my cities on the big continent and had airports and most cities on my home continent... I kept building tanks and used the airport to fly them over quickly.... I razed the zulu's, who were the weakest, first... after that I went on to raze the chinese (left them with 1 city)... and was preparing an attack on japan who had control of most of the continent. I only kept the most important cities of the zulu and chinese (those with resources/luxuries), but razed most. In 1900 AD, just when I wanted to start my attack on japan, I had a culture victory :( <br />
But... my score was much much better than my official game... I had 2221 points this time vs 1463 points in the first game!! <br />
Thanks to all the tips and strats on this forum I'm a much better player now...so thanks for all the hints and tips. <br />

Because I didn't play peacefully the 2nd game I managed to get some great leaders (already 1 in the war vs the persians, which I used to speed the FP), anyway...with the leaders I got in the modern wars I build armies and loaded them with elite tanks. Because I had an army of about 70 tanks to control I used stack movement (an added feature in v1.17f; hit 'j'). With stack movement you can order all units of the same type on that grid to move to a specific location, rather then giving all separate commands... <br />
When you have an army with tanks and normal tanks on the same grid... and you use stack movement for the tanks the game screws up badly... I can't really describe in words what happens, but it's clearly a bug. Can someone confirm this bug please?<br />

I may not be as good as Sir Pleb and the elite Civ guys, but I am pretty darn proud of the job I did. :-) I ended in 1902, and I never had to make the MPP go away, apparently, China was so war weary after almost 300 years of war that it ended the MPP with Persia. And in the end, I decided to help gang up against Germany since everyone in the world was doing it (If your friends jumped off a cliff, would you?) It was perfect because suddenly everyone was being polite to me!<br />
<br />
In preparation for the coming Cultural Victory, the turn or two prior, I reduced science spending to 10% and pumped up my luxuries to get everyone happy - since that helps the score too. I ended with 1716 points, not bad for someone who avoided war almost all of the game and only used culture to capture cities and resources. It is the highest score I have gotten, but I tend to stay under the Regent level.<br />

<br />
I usually play at Emporer level so Warlord took me by surprise!  I built every Wonder but two, and captured them in a series of one sided wars.  <br />
<br />
I first wiped out the balayonians, keeping thier cities, not one flipped.  Then I killed off the persians after my toughest war.  Immortal versus Elephants.  The immortals were pretty strong.  The other civs kept demanding from me and after my refusal they declared war.<br />
<br />
I focussed on the strongest of the other civs next, which was the Zulu.  Took thier far eastern city, built an Airport, and slaughter them with tanks vs calvary.  I had MMP with China and Japan.  I wiped out the Zulu, and was destroying the English, when the chinese made me mad by founding cities in the land I conquered.  So I wiped them out whlie killing the English and Germans.  I had three battle fronts.<br />
<br />
I was about to wipe out the English and had the Germans beaten down when I won by Cultural victory in 1832.  ALL my cities were fire firerockets almost the whole game.<br />

I had around 2228 points.<br />

<br />
Here is my story:<br />
<br />
I started expanding on the eastern part of my island.  I got a city on the choke point in 1790BC.  In 190AD, Persia declared war on me.  I've been building spearmen and horsemen and rushing science to get the war elephant.  I'm obviously bypassing swordmen since I have no iron.  I get a leader in my first elite attack in 190AD.  I'm planning to take out Persia and Babylon as soon as I get war elephants so I'm saving the leader for the forbidden palace.<br />
<br />
300AD:  Gave Babylon currency to attack Persia.<br />
460AD:  Build great lighthouse and got golden age.<br />
480AD:  I started pre-building Sun Tsu in Bombay.<br />
600AD:  Persia is destroying Babylon and I want my share so I declare war too and start taking cities.<br />
870AD:  Peace<br />
1010AD:  I found the sea path east of my island to the large continent.<br />
1030AD:  The Chinese robbed me of the Hanging Gardens when I had 2 turns left to complete it.<br />
1090AD:  Finally I have contact with all 7 civs.  I didn't have to trade any contact since my 2 galleys just went up and down the coast until I had reached all of the other civs.<br />
1210AD:  I am building my science and economy.<br />
1305AD:  I get a city on the large continent.<br />
1430AD:  No salt.  I had gunpowder for a while and never realized.  I notice that I can steal salt from Persia without going to war by just building 2 cities and edging in on their territory.<br />
1505AD:  My iron ran out and I must get some more from Persia through war.<br />
1550AD:  Persia has only one city left and wont talk peace (???).<br />
1580AD:  Finally I get peace with Persia for techs and gold.  Meanwhile, I have expanded to 3 cities on the large continent (between England and Japan).  I also have an ROP wth Japan and Zulu.<br />
1660AD:  I become a democracy.<br />
1735AD:  I get universal sufferage.<br />
1752:  I get Theory of Evolution.  The first tech I get is Electronics.  Then, the message pops up that says &quot;we have learned Medicine from the Chinese&quot;.  I already knew medicine.  Anyway, I also get Refining, which the interface allowed me to select.  I'm switching production of Battlefield Medicine to Hoover Dam and I'm restarting Battlefield Medicine in another city.<br />
1768AD:  Everyone is trying to get an MPP with me and I keep refusing.<br />
1776AD:  I get Hoover Dam.  A city that flipped from China to me now flips back.  This is very strange since it had pop12 with a temple, cathedral, walls and barracks.  It also had a garrison of 3 infantry and 1 artillery.  Checking the histograph, I have double the Chinese culture.  How this switched back I'll never know.<br />
1794AD:  I can't get a spy in China and they finally declare war since they keep catching me trying to plant one.<br />
1798AD:  The strange city flip now flips back to me.  This is the third flip for this city in a few turns.<br />
1800AD:  I land 24 tanks, 4 infantry and 4 artillery near the rubber on the southern tip of China.  I'm also sending 4 infantry and 4 artillery off the western coast of china.  They are headed for the salt deposit on the north coast.  The transports are going back for the second wave of troops.<br />
1810:  My forces are having fun with China and then they ask for peace.  They actually have the nerve to ask for 2 workers for peace.  Since I'm winning the war, I say no (too bad there is no &quot;I'm laughing at your offer&quot; button).<br />
1812:  Persia has only one city on the north western tip of my island.  I need this for strategic reasons to help with the war against Chine so I kill off Persia.<br />
1818:  Second leader in China builds army.<br />
1824:  I capture Smith's Trading from China.<br />
1832:  I got Sistine Chapel from China.<br />
1834:  I research Fission.  Giving the map a quick once over, I see two uranium deposits (other than the ones I have).  They are in Zulu and Germany.  I get peace with China for 2 cities and gold.<br />
1836:  I build the UN.<br />
1850:  Germany declares war (why I don't know).  I switch to communism.  Zulu has MPP with Germany so they declare war also.  I sign MPP with England and Japan and give both flight.  Later on, I will be at war with both of them and they never build any planes until the very end (maybe 5 or 6 turns before I win by culture).<br />
1856  Germany got a leader in a battle near one of my cities.  They had a chance to move the leader away but instead decided to move him only one tile to where they had one unit.  The leader gets killed from a Japanese attack.<br />
1858:  Germany invades my island with 1 knight, 1 swordsman, and 2 horseman.  I'm not sure if I can handle this invasion force with my homeland defense force.  Let's see.  I have 22 artillery, 31 tanks, 20 cavalry, and 2 infantry in every city.  I lost a total of, wait, I have it written down somewhere, ah yes, 0 hit points while killing the entire invasion force.<br />
1868:  I get another leader on the large continent.  I am sending a transport to bring him back to hurry a wonder.  Why can't you airlift a leader?<br />
1874:  Zimbabwe falls and I get Pyramids.  I then get peace with Zulu for city and 7gpt and 65gold.  Peace also with Germany for 16gpt and 12gold.<br />
1884:  I build 6 new cities on the large continent.<br />
1890:  I get Seti and Apollo.  One of my cities flips to Zulu.  I'm starting on the spaceship.  This runs out to be a waste since I will win by culture before completing the ship.<br />
1896:  Zulu is destroyed.<br />
1928:  England demands Fission from me.  I think I will give them 50 modern armor instead.<br />
1934:  War with England and Japan.  I switch to communism.  England and Japan are also at war with each other.<br />
1936:  This is the first turn of the war and it starts great.  On this turn alone, I get 8 English cities and 3 Japanese cities (one of which contains Magellans Voyage).  Modern Armor is great.<br />
1956:  The I have conquered all of China, all of Zulu, half of Japan and a third of England.  Germany, who I had my first war with, is untouched and I am at peace with them.<br />
1957:  Culture victory.<br />

Victory at 2050 A.D.  Had my choice of Conquest, domination, cultural, or histographic.  Can meet all of those simultaneously, but the computer awards a conquest, in that case.  I can end up with 100,001 culture points, have 11 cities expand their borders, settle a new city, and take out the last civ on the last turn.  So for domination, I settle the city, let the other cities expand borders, but not take out England.  For cultural, I don't settle that new city, I sell the temples in cities whose borders will expand,  rush buy libraries in 7 other cities and end up with exactly 100,000 culture points.  Histographic, just sell the temples.<br />
<br />
All of them ended with the same score, so it doesn't matter.  I could have gone for spaceship, too.  But doing all my own research would have cost me points.  I only researched maybe 4 techs into the modern age.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 15, 2002, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I decided to try a Settler flood in GOTM VI, with no military conflicts at all.  The starting spot looked just about right, and the settings too.  I probably wouldn't have tried it if I knew so much water was present though.  I hadn't planned on using sea transport.  I just assumed all the land would be linked from the Pangaea setting.<br />
<br />
I started out building a Warrior and then a Settler.  After that most of my cities just build Settlers.  I didn't pack my cities too closely, but in most cases I built a city within 2 tiles of the closest city.<br />
<br />
When I found out I was on a secondary landmass, I waffled a bit and started mixing in a culture victory path.  They were close enough that either way would only be slowed down a bit, but it did still slow me down.<br />
<br />
I boxed in both the Persians and the Babylonians early on, then applied a culture squeeze.  I had several Persian cities down to 1 tile useable.  The Babylonians were down to only 2 cities after demanding some and culturally aquiring the others.  The Persians had about 5, most of which should have culture flipped.  I had about 5 times the culture of all the AI combined.<br />
<br />
When I finished the Lighthouse I started ferrying Settlers across, but didn't have much of a fleet of ships yet.  I had plenty of Settlers just sitting around waiting for boats.  I kept demanding cities from the AI every 20 turns, the Zulu and the Persians were the only one's that I couldn't get to give up cities.  I always demanded the cities with the best food sources nearby.<br />
<br />
On the main continent I used my money to rush a Settler every time a city hit size 3.  I claimed most of my territory on the main continent this way, as the transports took too long.  Still I hit the domination limit quite early.  Playing it again I would be able to shave off about 20-30 turns I think.<br />
<br />
I ended up with about 40 spare settlers in boats, or waiting for boats, too late.  I had built every wonder of the world up to that point, and every AI was Polite, even though I had constantly blackmailed cities out of most of them, and culturally limited the rest of their cities for the most part.  My military consisted of a few Caravels, 1 Warrior, and 1 Spearman.  I hadn't fought a single battle against the AI, and only 2 or 3 against barbarians.</div></div><hr />

<br />
None of the the victory conditions offer any special bonuses.  The score is just by territory, happy people, and specialists (and early win bonus, if applicable).  Since the score is averaged from every turn, a 2050 A.D. game, there would be very little, if anything, you could do on the last turn to affect your score.  There are 540 turns, so you would have to have a change in 540 points on the last turn, just to up your score by 1 point.  Since the scoring factor for warlord is X2, that means I would have to add 270 tiles of territory, 270 specialists, or 135 happy people on the last turn, just to get one more point.  Maybe less, if rounding up or down of the score happens to be the case.<br />
<br />
One example, though of a scoring change on the last turn, was one game, where I launched a bunch of nukes at 2049 A.D., during the AI's turn, they retaliated with a bunch of nukes of their own.  I was in democracy, so the new war weariness, lost citizens from the nukes, and unhappiness from loss of luxuries affected the score by several points.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of having like 100 settlers, and on the last turn claim every single tile left on the map, but that would change my score by probably only 5 points.  And I would probably lose those 5 points earlier because of the lost population points from building those settlers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nbarclay</div><div class="date">Apr 16, 2002, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's how my game went.  I've finished but haven't officially submitted it yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
When I saw that the April game was Warlord level, I almost decided to skip it.  Milking a game for score is no fun for me, not so much because I inherently hate micromanagement as because I hate micromanaging for something as artificial as a score number.  And for someone who routinely stomps Monarch level, where’s the challenge in Warlord?<br />
<br />
And then I found a possible challenge.  It occurred to me that there is one thing that might possibly in some ways be harder on Warlord than it is on Monarch: winning an early (circa 1800 AD or earlier, at least pre-1.17f) space race victory.  Yes, I’d do better in early expansion and in any wars I fought on Warlord.  But on the other hand, I couldn’t count on getting anywhere near as much tech from the AIs, and probably not as much gold either.  So at least there was a possibility that I might find something interesting in the game, trying to win the space race as early as possible.<br />
<br />
As I started sending warriors out to explore, I discovered that the starting position was truly excellent.  Originally, I had planned to keep Delhi at size three and above so I’d always get full advantage from all three wheat tiles in its radius.  But when I spotted all those cattle, building settlers about as quickly as possible (and a few workers to make the new cities worth more) became the order of the day.  By the time I was finished expanding, I had everything on my side of the chokepoint and two cities on the other side: one a little north of the elephants (ivory) and one amidst the three gold mountains a little farther west.  (The elephants were in an unclaimed area in between my city and a Babylonian city.  Babylon actually got the first claim, but some judicious construction and rush buying shifted the cultural border permanently in my favor not long after.)<br />
<br />
The rivers proved their worth.  Usually, even on 1.16f, I would go at least two or three advances with science at 10% before it seemed worthwhile to start investing gold in science.  But this time around, if I recall correctly, I started investing heavily in research after just one, and I switched to Republic in 550 BC.<br />
<br />
Once I finished expanding as far as I could without placing cities behind AI lines where they would be vulnerable, I decided to go for about the closest thing to a “peaceful builder” game as I ever do.  (More about that later.)  My lack of iron was a significant part of the reason; what does a peaceful builder need with iron?  I also decided to make getting as many wonders as possible a priority; the only one I missed was the Pyramids.  Those decisions were potential distractions from my “early space race” goal, but I hoped I could pull it off.<br />
<br />
I did have one minor skirmish with the Persians (190 BC to 10 AD) when they declared war and made a couple half-hearted attempts to get units into my territory, but it wasn’t any big deal.  I killed about four units that tried to invade, but I didn’t try sending my own forces into the teeth of Persia’s so-called immortals.<br />
<br />
With the Great Lighthouse, I sent a galley probing for a safe way from my continent to other waters, and I eventually found one.  I met the northern AIs first before they and the southern ones had met, and I learned about some in-between land free for the taking with dyes, furs, and iron.  Settlers and transportation for them became a priority for a while, and I ended up with four towns in that area founded from 550-840 AD.  The last had plans for its position hastily altered as I noticed a saltpeter deposit in the desert near the original planned location.<br />
<br />
As the end of the first millennium AD approached (and not too long before the end of the Medieval Age), my cities started complaining that there was nothing left for them to build.  So I did what any good, almost-peaceful builder would do: I started cranking out war elephants.  Then when I discovered Steam Power, my first Industrial Age advance (as always), I found myself without a good supply of coal.  (Actually, I had one in some jungles on the big continent, but I didn’t notice right away since it wasn’t connected.)  Again I did what any good ALMOST-peaceful builder would do.  I researched military tradition, upgraded my war elephants and all but one older horse unit to cavalry, and stormed Persia for its coal supply with a total of 34 cavalry brigades.  Not surprisingly, Persia fell quite rapidly, and then I decided to gobble up Babylon too while I was at it.  (Neither one of them even knew what a gun was until I started shooting at them!)<br />
<br />
The Persian and Babylonian annexations (I hesitate to dignify them with the term “wars”) also had a second cause.  I was starting to hit the limit of what my original core could afford in research, and techs were about to get a lot more expensive.  I had already built my forbidden palace on the very edge of my territory, on the theory that I would probably annex Persia and Babylon eventually.  So once those territories were annexed, I could start work on adding those cities to my wealth and science base.  (One perennial problem with my &quot;builder&quot; type operations is the need to obtain new territory to build up.)<br />
<br />
With a coal supply secured, I went on to learn more advances, and military production paused at times while I built factories, a few coal plants, and hospitals.  But my cities were still bored much of the time, with nothing better to do than to build cavalry (and, a little later, some infantry).  And with all those cavalry units and a tech lead of several centuries, it would have been a shame not to do SOMETHING with them, right?<br />
<br />
Besides, I was tired of Germany and the Zulus charging exorbitant prices for gems and incense (Germany) and wines (Zululand).  Not that I wanted to go after Germany, since I would get my luxuries cut off temporarily.  But China happened to be unlucky enough to have the exact same luxuries Germany did, albeit only enough for themselves.  And as if that weren’t enough, they had been foolish enough to try to run a bluff in an attempt at extortion.  Better, one of the two Zulu wine centers was deep in Chinese territory.  And the Zulus, too, had provided a pretext for war with a failed extortion attempt.<br />
<br />
So I landed an initial assault force of 20 cavalry and four infantry on Chinese soil.  At first, Chinese riders gave me a bit of a hard time; their ability to match my cavalry in speed was more than a little inconvenient.  But when reinforcements started arriving, the only thing that saved China was my people’s getting a bit tired of the war.  I left China with five cities and, not long after, shifted targets to the Zulus.<br />
<br />
The Zulus did manage to temporarily occupy a recently captured Chinese city near my original “big continent” settlements, but I took it back quickly and inflicted worse casualties than I took on that front.  In the meantime, only the vast distance between the Chinese heartland and the Zulu heartland saved the Zulus from annihilation.  (That and the fact that my workers who could have reduced the distance to practically nothing with railroads were on the wrong continent.)  Again, war discontent brought the war to an early end.<br />
<br />
Around that period, research slowed a bit (six turns a tech instead of four) for Atomic Theory and Electronics, but I wanted the Hoover Dam (which was rushed by my second great leader from the Chinese war).  Then I went back for some cheaper advances, and by the time advances started getting expensive again, I could afford them.<br />
<br />
By the time my peace treaty with China ended, captured workers had run a rail line from one end of the front lines to the other.  Indian cavalry hit China’s five remaining cities so quickly that what seemed like half China’s military got caught out in the field where it was useless.  They never even got a chance to counterattack!<br />
<br />
I thought about another war with the Zulus, but after having been pretty thoroughly squashed, they were being steady (if not wealthy) customers for my luxury goods.  They were worth as much to me alive as dead, so they got to live.<br />
<br />
Things were peaceful for a while after that, and my cities with nothing better to do had already shifted from military production to wealth.  But toward the end of the industrial age, Germany got an attack of insanity and declared war.  Worse, their insanity was contagious, and England caught it too.<br />
<br />
But the Germans were too stupid to attack in force, and my cities that had had nothing better to do than producing wealth suddenly found a new purpose in life: building a couple battleships and some tanks.  Lots and lots of tanks, actually.  I fended off the initial attacks with the few cavalry and infantry on hand (most of my forces were on the wrong side of the Zulus), and then gave England a demonstration of what happens when swordsmen, spearmen, and archers (and a few cavalry and knights) think they can go up against armor.  My generals thought it was pretty, but I suspect their English counterparts wouldn’t agree.<br />
<br />
Then one of my strategists got an idea: instead of ferrying tanks to the front lines, why not land them deep behind the lines?  England stayed in the fight through the loss of three cities, but when three more fell all at once, including a second and third relatively deep in English territory, they agreed to peace.  Germany, already deprived of its ally and one small city and in imminent danger of losing another one, also agreed to peace.  And India’s over 50 tank battalions, built purely with left-over production, made a nice deterrent against further attempts at national suicide by foreign powers.<br />
<br />
Ironically, once the war was over, India gave England back its captured cities and even gave England the captured German city.  The cities were worth little, and trying to manage them was having an adverse impact on corruption in the better-developed original big-continent settlements.<br />
<br />
Just before the war ended, the discovery of the Theory of Evolution at the very dawn of the modern age brought about the quick discovery of Fission and Nuclear Power.  (That’s one thing I unequivocally like about 1.17f.  In earlier versions, I would have been stuck with Communism and Espionage since the AI hadn’t gotten to them yet.)  The rest of the needed advances clicked into place every four turns like clockwork, and the starship left for Alpha Centauri in 1695 AD.<br />

<br />
I figured before the game started that I'd go for a Culture Win - the map was &quot;large&quot;, which meant lots of cities and the &quot;pangea&quot; meant easy expansion. Early on I expanded as quick as possible, building very few troops (just a few for exploration). After I closed the bottle neck I concentrated on expanding out from there - I figured I'd fill in the holes to the east later. This worked pretty well until Babylon sneaked a settler through and built a city near the horses. I didn't want to go to war - no troops yet. It didn't end up being a problem though because it culture flipped about 20 turns later.<br />
<br />
Soon most of the land was taken and I noticed - no iron nearby. But it didn't matter because I was going for war elephants. Once I got them, I took out both the Babs and the Persians with masses of them. I got a small foothold on a peninsula to the east during the war by sending a suicide galley across with a settler and then almost lost the cities that were slowly developing when the Germans declared war. I eventually got some war elephants over to help out and managed a peace treaty with them. <br />
<br />
After I got to education I turned science off and rush built (now in monarchy) every cultural improvement up to university in every city on my continent. Near the end I was making near 1000 culture/turn.<br />
<br />
Ended up 1954pts in 1806AD.<br />

Has anyone seen on pg 114 of the manual it says &quot;During wartime footing, cultural improvements produce half the number normally produced.&quot;? I know this wasn't the case in my game. Maybe only on higher difficulties?</div></div><hr />

Aeson, With such a small millitary how did you keep the AI from launching attacks on your undefended cities? Lot's of bribes and culture does not alway placate an AI who senses a weakness.<br />
<br />
I've become a firm believer that the most important part of the AI's valuation of power is number of cities.  I had at least 20 times the number of cities of any of the AI.  Also I was practically giving away everything I had to the AI, as they posed no threat whatsoever.  Renegotiating peace every 20 turns, and current ROP agreements with everyone were also a factor.  The AI is less willing to go to war if there is a current agreement they would be breaking.  Worried about their own reputation.<br />
<br />
The Persians had barely any units, the Babylonians even less.  It's hard to support an army when you are in a Republic (which I gave them each early on) and have a civilization comprised of less than 40 tiles!  They each could have launched a suprise attack and done some limited damage.  With my culture about 30 times theirs, almost any city they took would have flipped back to me very quickly.  With over 100 cities on the home continent and 500 gold per turn rolling in, I could have rushed at about 20 Horsemen on any given turn.  Any offensive by the AI would have been very short lived.<br />
<br />
I've used similar tactics on Deity, the Warlord AI really didn't worry me at all.  If you'd like to see how a &quot;sneak&quot; attack can be averted indefinitely with just a handful of units...  check the screenshot from a game I was playing today.  Deity, and at the time I had around 10 military units.<br />

Nor does a large military. I probably had more units than the rest of the world when the english declared war on me out of the blue. Frequent contact and small continuing bribes are the best way to avoid wars I have found.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this normaly works in my games. But you´ll get only cities with small numbers of population.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is best to watch for when the AI founds a new city to renegotiate peace, this way it won't have happiness problems.  The resources can be uncovered or not, it doesn't matter.  The AI knows they are there from the start of the game.  When you check the powergraph, the 2 top AI will never pay cities for renegotiated peace.  You can sometimes get cheap techs or gold.  The top AI will usually part with about 20 gold at the most.  The least powerful AI will often give 2+ cities.  The rest will only give 1.  I think that power is rated numerically like in the historian pop up (1, 2, 3, 4... ect.), the powergraph just tells you in which order, not magnitude.</div></div><hr />

The importance of it depends on what victory you are going for.  If you are going for spaceship then it would help build parts, but if you are going for culture or diplomatic it probably won't help as much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've found that if I plan my research right, everything else on my spaceship is ready to go by the time I get Laser technology even without an iron works.  The trick is to research the techs that go with the most expensive parts first and save Laser for last since the Planetary Party Lounge is dirt cheap (at least as ship parts go).<br />
<br />
Another sneaky trick I inferred from a post someone made and tried successfully this time around is that if you have another spaceship part completed the same turn you discover Laser, when the spaceship screen comes up for the other part's completion, you can use the controls on the screen to assign the Planetary Party Lounge to a city before your regular turn starts.  If you have a city far enough along producing something else and the timing goes right (and I have no idea how reliable that is, having just tried the trick once), that technique can let you complete and launch the spaceship the SAME turn you discover Laser technology.  Cities building battleshps can be pretty good candidates for that maneuver, depending on timing, since battleships are so expensive.<br />

This game was fun and I think I will participate in every game from now on. Here's my story:<br />
<br />
Since the land east of the chokepoint is pretty good, I decided to build 3-apart cities. Built a lot of warriors to explore and to kill barbarians and left cities mostly undefended. At warlord, that's possible due to more content citizens. I let all cities build settlers, so they never exceeded size 3 and I didn't have happiness penalties. This way, I soon had settled all land east of the chokepoint and even 2 luxury cities (ivory and silks) behind it. Time to raise diplomacy. Since I was by far the biggest fish at the continent, Babylon and Persia were so friendly to support me with free techs and cities on peace negotiations. I still built almost exclusively settlers and workers and expanded like crazy. The only thing I missed was iron, but I didn't really miss it.<br />
<br />
About 500BC I decided that there is no room for more than one civ at the continent. I switched my core production to horsemen and stockpiled them at Babylons borders. 150BC I negotiated peace with Persia again, but cancelled the peace treaty with Babylon. My horsemen captured/razed the whole Babylon till 110AD (see my 10AD save). After the Babylonian campaign and finishing my Forbidden palace in the coreland, I made a free palace jump to an extorted Persian city. Since I just had discovered Chivalry, I upgraded all my brave horsemen to War elephants. I still had no iron (and the Persians 2), but who cares. I hadn't seen much Immortals so far.<br />
<br />
My Persian campaign was fought 670-770AD. I quickly moved 2 of my elephants to the iron sources and cut the roads. Then I slaughtered poor Xerxes, wading in blood to my knees. I saw maybe 5 Immortals, rest Spearmen. After he was gone, 2 of my blocking galleys turned north. They didn't sink since I just had discovered Navigation. Soon (790AD) I found China.<br />
<br />
After a few turns of diplomacy, I had contact with everybody and a nice map of the northern continent. It's western and eastern subcontinents were tightly settled by Chinese and English+Germans. The huge mid part was only half settled by the Japanese. The Zulus were almost gone, since everybody fought them. They were the only civ wiped out without my participation. Soon they were wiped out. I sent lots of Caravels with settlers and soon the southern part of the other continent was mine. I had 6 own luxuries now.<br />
<br />
My next target were the Japanese. They were far behind in technology (just like everybody else) and an easy ride for my new Cavalrists. They had no Samurai, since they didn't have Chivalry yet. I captured the whole Japan and settled the gaps tightly (3-apart) to prevent sneak-ins. The Japanese campaign took most of the 14th century.<br />
<br />
In the 15th century I was busy wiping out China. They were a pain, since they had lots of Riders and unaccessable resource tiles. But my whole coreland was building fresh Cavalries, and the attack never was about to falter. 1495, China was gone. I razed most of the cities, since I had roughly 50% of the landmass settled and didn't want to trigger Domination. The only city I captured was a gem city at a peninsula with much mountains, good to defend from those annoying Riders. The Chinese workers I used to plant forests in my new Western national park.<br />
<br />
After I founded an incense city in former North China, I had all 8 luxuries. That was good, since I still was a Republic. I didn't have discovered Democracy, no use for war weary riots. Republic is cool, happy citizens turned content but that was all. Meanwhile I had roughly 1 era tech lead. Germany just had discovered Military tradition, I was 1 turn apart from Motorized Transportation. My forces outweighted the German and English far, both in quality and quantity. I had over 100 cities (lazy to count them though), both Germany and England had roughly 20. In this hopeless for him situation, Herr Bismarck declared war on me. What the heck? A nice way to commit suicide. I decided to skip England as my next target, and flooded Germany with most of my 140 Cavalries. No, wait, lots of them remained in former China as park rangers ;), to fight the white-clothed campers, which were occasionally popping up there and bullying my peaceful Chinese wood planters.<br />
<br />
Soon my 11 Transports had landed 100 Cavalries and 100 Tanks in Germany. Far more than I really needed. It was a matter of a few turns and the German coreland was overrun. To access the German jungle cities, I had to declare war on England. Nothing could stop me. But I was not only destructive. The German and English workers were building my Eastern national park now.<br />
<br />
In 1620AD was only a single English city (IIRC it was Brighton) at an island left. I already had build hordes of Privateers, to block it and to milk the game. But oh well, to be honest I got a bit tired of it. So I landed 8 cavalries to finish the city. I needed only one of them though (there was only one Spearman inside).<br />
<br />
Conquest victory in 1625AD.</div></div><hr />

China met with a much harsher fate in my game than in yours.  For some reason, they attack part of my force that I had in Indian-occupied Germany, and through a complex web of MPP's, (I had one with England, England had one with Zulu, Zulu had one with Germany, and they with Japan) the whole world ended up at war with China:ripper: <br />
<br />
Basically, it was a contest to see who could grab as much land as quickly as possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From reading other posts, i guess i won't win anything, but it was a fun game to play.<br />
<br />
I screwed up by overestimating the AI on warlord level since i am use to monarch. Soooo... i advanced slowly in the beginning because i was waiting for the AI to do my research. Once i decided that wasn't a good idea, i moved right along.<br />
<br />
Deciding which victory to go for was a problem as well. It became obvious to me that i would not be competitive, so i just played a builder game and went cultural. Got it much earlier than others i have read about, but i doubt it will be anything spectacular.<br />
<br />
Hopefully i didn't pick up any bad habits for my next game on monarch. Oh... the next game will be different anyway... new patch is out!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beard Rinker</div><div class="date">Apr 19, 2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Strategy<br />
<br />
My goal this month was the new award, fastest spaceship victory.<br />
<br />
The biggest bottleneck in a spaceship victory is research.  Production is seldom the problem as by the time it's possible to build the space ship, there are usually several high production cities available.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, my strategy revolved mostly around ways of researching as fast as possible.  The main points of my strategy are as follows:<br />
  AI Help - This could be the best way to speed up research.  The fastest I can research is one technology every four turns.  With several viable opponents, it should be possible to get technology quicker than this through trading.<br />
  Optimal Size - My plan was to grow to the optimal number of cities then stop; focusing on research and generating gold for research.  Growing beyond the optimal number of cities has diminishing returns and may draw my resources away from research.<br />
  Wonders - Priority wonders are ones that directly help research (i.e. Copernicus's Observatory, Newton's University, Theory of Evolution and SETI Program) then ones that help indirectly (The Pyramids, Hoover Dam, etc).  Wonders like The Great Wall and Universal Suffrage are of little value.<br />
  Pre-building Key Items - Key city improvements and wonders should be pre-built as much as possible before the required technology is discovered.  This will maximize their value and in the case of wonders, minimize the chance of losing a key wonder.  This strategy is especially useful for the last couple of spaceship components.   Ideally, the spaceship can be completed the turn after the last required technology is discovered.  This strategy makes The Manhattan Project a worthwhile wonder as ICBM’s work well for pre-building spaceship components.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ancient Times<br />
<br />
This month was any easy map and an easy level.  From the start I had doubts about my primary strategy of getting the AI to help in research.  Fat chance on warlord level.<br />
<br />
My first focus as usual was founding as many cities as possible.  Since my goal was research and it was warlord level, my cities were not built ICS style.  I wanted all cities to grow to their maximum potential so they were laid out with minimal overlap.<br />
<br />
For the first while most cities produced warriors or settlers.  Settler production was timed so a settler was produced as the city hit size 3.  The warriors were useful for finding huts and preventing my neighbors from becoming too aggressive.<br />
<br />
Throughout this build out process my city count was always around double the Persians and triple the Babylonians.  Research at this time wasn't a priority.  It was kept at a minimal level for 1 technology every 40 turns and always on the most expensive technology.  Several technologies were obtained through trading and 1 was found in a hut.<br />
<br />
By the time expansion was nearing completion on the home continent, I had claimed all of the area near the start position and a strip of cities between the Persians and Babylonians.  I had also managed to claim spices, ivory and silk.<br />
<br />
Middle Ages<br />
<br />
I completed the Great Lighthouse wonder around the start of the middle ages and set out in search of the other civilizations.  It didn't take long to find the Chinese then buy contact to all others.<br />
<br />
Keeping with my strategy, I made sure everyone had contact with everyone else and everyone was on par technologically.  I also began doing my own research starting with the most expensive technology.  My hope was the AI would research the cheap ones and I'd trade for them.<br />
<br />
Through exploration and obtaining maps, I discovered some unclaimed dyes, gems, furs and wines.  I was able to claim the gems, dyes and furs but didn't bother with the wines.  This gave me 6 luxuries.  With luck, I would be able to trade for the other two with the discovery of Magnetism.<br />
<br />
I increased my research spending as cash permitted and eventually started researching the cheap technologies.  The AI was hardly helping out at all, mostly adding unrequired technologies from the previous age.  By the end of this age I was researching a technology every 4 turns.<br />
<br />
Due to my quick start, my culture was far higher than everyone else.  This resulted in about 4 or 5 cities defecting to me during the course of the game.  In most cases, I either refused the city or gave it right back.  My empire was right around the optimal number and I didn't want the addition of some poorly developed city on the outskirts of my empire causing empire wide corruption.  I later learned this is not how corruption is calculated and should have kept them.<br />
<br />
Industrial Ages<br />
<br />
This is the age where I gave up dragging the AI along in the tech race.  Their research rate was beyond stupid.  Any slower and they would be forgetting technologies.<br />
<br />
At the start of the age, either the Germans or Babylonians discovered Nationalism.  Scientific civilizations get one free advance at the start of each age.  Between the 7 of them the only other technologies they discovered in this age were Espionage, Communism and Sanitation and these weren't required technologies.<br />
<br />
I was able to discover a technology every four turns throughout this entire age.  I made one researching detour to get the unrequired Sanatation technology, but this was needed to continue my research momentum.  With hospitals, my cities could grow to their maximum potential increasing my income by about 2/3.  The AI's did eventually discover this one but I'm not sure I could have waited.  Half way through the industrial age I was barely able to afford to keep the research rate at one technology every four turns.  The extra income as a result of hospitals made the difference.<br />
<br />
With the discovery of Scientific Method, I began construction of The Theory of Evolution wonder.  There was no danger in losing this to one of the AI's as they were several technologies behind.  This wonder gives two free advances; the one currently being researched and one other.  To maximize the benefit, I timed this wonder to complete one turn after discovering a technology.  I also started research on the most expensive technology and set the research level to zero for the one turn while waiting.  This gave me a bunch of gold and 2 expensive technologies.  I'm not sure what happens first when a wonder is one turn from completion and you are one turn from a discovery.  I might have been able to squeeze another turn out of this.<br />
<br />
Although I had given up keeping all opponents even in technology, I was selling technologies to the highest bidder.  The extra gold was banked for the modern age when technologies got more expensive.  I also brought the Germans up to par with me in research towards the end of the age.  My reasoning was to trade for the free technology they would get once they hit the modern age.<br />
<br />
Around the end of the industrial age, I was becoming concerned that I wouldn't be able to continue to research one technology every four turns in the modern age.  I had a considerable amount of gold saved up, but you can only set the research rate to 100%.  What I needed was a larger income, even if all of it is lost to corruption.<br />
<br />
After reading Alexman's thread on corruption I learned that corruption due to the number of cities depends on the number of cities closer to the capital, not the total number of cities.  This means adding cities to the outer part of the empire should have no effect on the core cities.  It also means I probably could have a much larger empire and expect a reasonable return from the extra cities.<br />
<br />
The obvious way to increase my income was to take out the Babylonians.  My military was far superior to theirs both numerically and technologically so the outcome was never in doubt.  The Babylonians were destroyed in 2 turns without using any ROP violation tricks.  Casualty count: 1 cavalry.  This netted me additional 7 cities giving me 30 in total.<br />
<br />
I had two elite warriors from barbarian attacks at the beginning of the game so I though I'd take a shot at getting a leader.  They had two bowmen standing around so I pounded them down to 1 hp and killed them with the elite warriors.  No luck though, I'll likely go the entire game without a leader.<br />
<br />
Modern Times<br />
<br />
I entered modern times with over 22,000 gold banked.  However, upon starting my first modern age research project, I discovered it would take 5 turns at 100% research to learn the cheapest technology.  Allot of good that banked gold is doing.<br />
<br />
I brought the Germans into the modern age by selling the required technologies to them.  They got their free technology, Rocketry, which I could buy outright or trade for once a few discoveries were made.<br />
<br />
I managed to bring my research time down to four turns by joining workers to my newly liberated Babylonian cities but the bigger problem remained.  This was the cheapest technology and I would have to increase my income substantially to continue this pace.<br />
<br />
Time was of the essence, I hoped to complete the game in 37 turns (9 techs * 4 turns + 1 turn for ss). Nearing panic, I considered my options:<br />
  Warfare - I could easily take several cities from the Persians.  I wouldn't be able to take all of them quickly as the Persian empire was large.  This option had many risks including the possibility of bringing all countries into war, falling into anarchy during the war, production diverted from the spaceship, and the time it takes to develop the new cities.  At this point I didn't know where the aluminum or uranium was and I may need to trade for them.<br />
  Rush Expansion - The conquered Babylonian cities were not fully developed and there were a few places in my empire some cities could be squeezed in.  My massive bankroll and large production capacity could have these cities fully developed and populated quickly although I'm not sure they could contribute quick enough.<br />
  Computers - This technology gives me the SETI Program wonder and research labs.  I had already prebuilt the SETI Program and could complete it within a few turns of the discovery.  If I research this technology first and prebuild research labs everywhere I could have research labs in most cities about 5 or<br />
6 turns into the modern age.  Since the research rate is at 100%, this would effectively increase my income by 50%.  This sounds like a winner.<br />
<br />
It was obvious that I had saved way too much gold.  With trading, my treasury was still building even with research at 100%.  It may start shrinking once the deals expire but it won't likely make a dent in the treasury by the end of the game.<br />
<br />
I proceeded to use my saved gold to rush improvements in the conquered Babylonian cities.  I also pre-built research labs in most cities in anticipation of the Computers technology.  Once it was discovered, I completed the SETI Program wonder and had research labs in most cities the next turn. The added income enabled me to research techs every four turns for the remainder of the game.<br />
<br />
To my surprise, the Germans researched a required technology on their own.  Perhaps favoring one or two AI opponents is a better approach for getting the AI to do some useful research.  From this point on, I gave my technology to the Germans and traded for any they discovered but with only 7 required technologies left they weren't able to help any more.<br />
<br />
The only potential glitch came two turns before the last spaceship technology.  For no apparent reason, the Zulu's moved a large force within the borders of a remote city of mine.  Their intent was obviously hostile and they declared war when I told them to leave.  My concern was not for the town, but that the Japanese would be dragged into a war against me as they were supplying aluminum.<br />
<br />
I contacted the Japanese and gave them whatever they wanted for an alliance against the Zulus.  For good measure, I did the same with everyone else.<br />
<br />
Two turns later I discovered the last spaceship and one turn after that my spaceship was launched.  The Zulus never did attack, seems they had bigger problems on their other borders.  I never fired a shot during this brief late war, as there really was no point.<br />
<br />
Throughout this entire game, I was at war for only 5 turns.  My only active war was the 2-turn conquest of the Babylonians.  As far as I could tell, none of the AIs were at war until the last few turns of the game although the Zulu's must have fought some early battle as their invasion force contained an army of warriors.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
<br />
This month's game was fun but not too challenging.  There was never a question of if I would win, just when.  With this map and this level I don't think any strategy would be difficult.  However, this was a nice change of pace.<br />
<br />
Some improvements on this strategy would be to grab more land at the start and keep most cities won by culture.  An early conquest of the Babylonians would have been beneficial.  The weaker civilizations do not contribute on any level and if their land is useful it's better off under my rule.<br />
<br />
On warlord level, I would have been better off favoring one or two AI opponents and leaving all others in the dust.  Having them all equal seemed to translate into them all being equally useless.  The only time they added research was at the start of an age and when one of them was ahead of the others.  On higher levels, having most or all of the AI opponents on par may be a viable strategy.<br />
<br />
A higher difficulty level would add an interesting dynamic to this strategy.  You want to keep the AI opponents on par technology-wise so they can contribute while still launching the spaceship before they do.  If you leave them behind or milk them too much it costs unrecoverable turns of research.  On the other hand, if you keep them at par you run the risk of invasion or losing the space race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BillChin</div><div class="date">Apr 21, 2002, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My game: I decide at the start to go for a one city cultural win (20,000 culture in one city).  I build one settler then use the capital for wonders and cultural improvement.  The first settler city is used to build the rest of the empire.  I build the Forbidden Palace at the choke point.  As the game progresses, I get bored, and launch a war with War Elephants.  I figure I might get a leader or two to rush some wonders.  I do get one leader as I conquer the home continent. <br />
<br />
The Zulu wipe out the Chinese early, and also build the Great Wall.  I think I miss out on one other wonder, but forget which one.<br />
<br />
In 1505 A. D. the capital reaches 10,000 culture, half way to the goal, chugging along with about 90 per turn.  I see some open land where the Zulu used to be with three luxuries.  I send some settlers to give me something to do while waiting for the cultural victory.  Tech is going fast with all the wonders, so I start building a spaceship.  It is a tight race as to whether I can finish the spaceship before I get a cultural victory.  Total culture wins out (100,000 for the empire), two turns from the spaceship, and 24 turns from the One City Cultural victory.<br />
<br />
I expect my score will be middle of the pack (as usual).  I did not think I could learn much from a Warlord game, but I think I did learn some useful techniques that can be applied on higher difficulty levels.</div></div><hr />

And a MDP with Germany and Babalon.  In 30 turns I'm holding with bablon and starting to advance, and got germany to go netural., But most of my workers in homeland are gone due to major raids by Babalon, and polution is becoming rampant.<br />
<br />
 then China and Japan Invade. #%&amp;^$, 5 turns later my goverment Collapse. but the Religeous Civ ability means next turn I can change to communist and keep fighting.<br />
<br />
I didn't loose any cities (that I started with) and ended up with half of bablon and a few japanese and 1 british city by the time the war was over.<br />
But now I'm about equal in tech and persia alread has 4 spaceship components.<br />
<br />
I do like the AI in Civ 3 compared to Civ 2.<br />
<br />
But While i had the Manhattan project I didn't have any way to use nukes (tech choices) other wise I might have used nukes to take out the invastion forces.<br />
<br />
I have notice that the AI never uses or threats with nukes.<br />
Good thing you can't have a nuclear winter in this game (but then it would only last for a few turns.<br />

<br />
If you know an AI civ is about to attack you (and it's normally pretty clear; look at the picture I posted of the stack China sent against me a few pages earlier on this thread) there is a way to deal with any Mutal Protection Pacts they may have. First sign your own MPP with all civs that the aggressor has them with. Then ask them to leave your territory; when they don't do so they will declare war on you. <br />
<br />
Now the tricky part: make sure that the aggressor civ attacks YOU first and not the other way around. This is easy to do by sending a worker as bait for them to capture. As long as you don't attack first, the other civs will join YOUR side in the war! It certainly makes things a lot easier; a civ allied with everyone else can be taken out this way without fighting the entire world as well. :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lawrence</div><div class="date">Apr 22, 2002, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am also shooting for &quot;Fastest Space Ship&quot; this time, and here's my path.<br />
<br />
Ancient Times<br />
<br />
Just built cities. But I had to stop when I had built 13, as the Babs and Persians have claimed nearly all open land. Secured Ivory and Spices, but not Iron. The Babs built Nineveh(their second city) near the iron square(I forgot, maybe I sold them Iron Working?). I decided to go war with them so I built a barracks in Delhi and pumped out 5 archers and 1 spearman, in the time when other cities are busy sending out people to colonize. <br />
<br />
This was not a good strategy as it proved later. Since the Zulus got the most precious wonder, the Pyramids, before me. If Delhi had started the wonder earlier, I would have a much faster growing rate and reduced costs on granaries.<br />
<br />
But militarily it is successful, my archers swiftly found the Babylonian capital of Babylon and captured it soon. I tried peace with the Babs, but they would not sign the deal of giving all their cities to me in return for a cease-fire. So Ur was captured as well. This time they are much more humble, and I got all their cities excluding Akkad.<br />
<br />
The unfortunate thing was that the Persians was also dragged in this war, against me. They have immortals, which I simply can't contain. My Iron was still on the hill waiting for the road network to get them down! :cry: I succeeded in begging peace after lost 1 city. Returned from Persia I changed to Republic.<br />
<br />
Middle Ages<br />
<br />
Completed the Great Lighthouse around the start of the middle ages and set out in search of the other civilizations. It didn't take long to find the Chinese, and I bought Monarchy plus contacts to all others with my World Map, contact to the Persians and Babs(they still have 1 city).<br />
<br />
The Colossus gave me the Golden Age and a good boost on research. Libraries and marketplaces was soon built in all major cities, and cathedrals in some big ones. Education was soon discovered, and all my cities was busy establishing a university and hire professors to it. I simply don't have the time to build enough elephants to defeat the Persians.<br />
<br />
Later I sold Education to all other civs, hoping they can research all 'branch' techs for me, I want the wonders, but not the  research time. I was able to reduce the researching time to four turns when Chemistry was out.<br />
<br />
Used 8 turns to develop Printing Press and Democracy, it is simply a waste of time...<br />
<br />
Industrial Ages<br />
<br />
I developed Steam Power before finding out that all coal deposits on this continent was in the Persian territory.:sad: So I researched immediately Military Tradition and upgraded all my elephants to cavalry. Started an assault on Persians, wiped them out of the continent in 20 turns or so(without their immortals I would finish much more quickly).<br />
<br />
Starting from the Corporation I have regained the speed of 4 turns a tech. Soon the AI had all the technologies in Middle Ages except Gravity. But they started a World War which means they won't be researching any more, so I gave them this final tech for all they have(Music, Economics, Navigation, Artistry). <br />
<br />
Modern Ages<br />
<br />
The first tech is definitely Computers. I used a 100% research rate to lower the time to 4 turns and lost about 1600 gold in this single tech:eek:. After that things was much more easier, I decided to attack the Zulus to improve my score, and they were wiped out in 10 turns. Then I stopped my armies, called them back to see the magnificent launch of Rama-1( the name of the ship, of course).<br />
<br />
End But New Beginning<br />
<br />
I latered replayed the game with the new patch. Fixed many things I've done wrong. I got the Pyramids, didn't enraged the Persians in Ancient Times, didn't wasted 8 turns on Printing Press and Democracy, and got things more smooth this time. <br />
<br />
Finally I launched the ship 95 years earlier than the submitted game. If I had used Beard Rinker's strat to build up the Germans, it would be 115 years earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Apr 22, 2002, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was nice to have a GOTM where even us mere mortals could beat the AI!<br />
<br />
I found the choke point early and grabbed it.  Crushed the Babylonians early but couldn't wipe 'em out cause they ran to that little island in the south.  No matter, there were still Persians nearby to kill and what's this?  I can actually build wonders in a GOTM!  Well, since I can't resist city improvements either and could never bring myself to sell a temple or library I figured it would be a culture win.  Thought I'd try for 20,000 points in Delhi.<br />
<br />
Well, it turns out I couldn't easily kill the Persians so I ended up making peace with them.  Delayed the FP thinking I could take out the Persians.  Ended up building it on the Persian border the hard way.<br />
<br />
After I found the other continent (late) the Chinese and Japanese killed off the Zulu leaving some nice land open for settlement so I built some cities over there.  Made MPPs with Japan and China so they wouldn't take my footholds over there.  England got trounced opening more land for me.:) <br />
<br />
By this time I realized that I'd get 100,000 total culture before 20,000 in Delhi.  So be it.  Persia actually attacked me and I ended up at war with China and England as well.  England got wiped out, mostly by the Germans.  I finally killed off both Persia and Babylon and sealed off China.  I ended up with six or eight armies!  Settled a large chunk of the southern coast on the big continent and had many cities flip to me along the way.<br />
<br />
Ended up with the culture win in 1956 - same as someone else (AndyS?).  Of course there were culture victories much earlier so I still won't be high in the standings.  Still an enjoyable game!<br />
<br />
BTW, had about 16,000 culture points in Delhi.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Germans actually saved me 8 turns in the modern age.  One from their free tech and one other they researched.  I think favoring 1 or 2 opponents is a good strategy when going for fastest space launch as 1 or 2 strong opponents will contribute to the research.<br />
<br />
My biggest mistake I think was not taking out the Babylonians early.  They never contributed anything and their extra territory might have allowed me to research techs every four turns sooner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started by sprawling up between the persians and the babs. And began buliding the FP very early right on the choke point. I attacked the Babs around 200 bc with horsemen and took all their cities but 1 by 100 ad, razed most of them and resettled getting rapid development from the bab worker horde. In about 650 i attacked the persians right after i upgraded by horsemen to elephants and finished them off in a few turns along with the last bab city by 700 ad. The elephants gave me a golden age which I leveraged rapidly through to infantry and tanks, once the hoover was finished. While this was being done i found the upper contintent at the China end and began sprawling again into their turf. England delcared war on me. I allied everyone but China against England nd never actually invaded their territory. While that war was going on. I captured China with Cavalry around 1200 if i recall the date right. My tank army was now ready. The other war was over without much real impact on the other civs except England had been weakened.<br />
<br />
The other civs had some mpps. So i invaded Zulu and got attacked by Japan and England. Again i avoided invading Japan to keep Germany out of the war. England stayed neutral. Once the Zulu looked done I signed an mpp with Germany. Japan atacked and voided their mpp with Germany which entered the war on my side. Japan pulled in England on their side, which was fine with me. All told it took about 12-15 turns to destroy the Zulu, Japan and England. My gov crashed on the last turn so i took a few turns to organize the captured territory and fill it up with settlers in choice spots.<br />
<br />
Germany was completely sealed off. After a few turns I attacked Germany and this took a bit longer since i was at my territory limit and had to raze everything, so moving troops was slower. Reduced the Germans to 2 cities and my gov crashed again so i made peace. At this point i just blockaded the Germans sold all my culture and science imps and grew for a few hundred years. Had a choice of 3 victories on the last turn; missed the spaceship option by 5 turns due to a miscalculation much earlier. UN wasnt likely since Bismarck was still furious with me and there were only the two of us left :egypt: Ended up with a nice score tho probably not high enough to win. If i had been able to find the upper continent faster it would have definitely have improved my score a lot.<br />
<br />
As it was i just missed topping the high score in the HOF for Warlord :( But it was huge improvement over my first GOTM and gave me the opportunity to employ much that I learned in that one, so I look forward to the next one :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but the high score on Warlord was a huge map, not large.  Imagine what your score would have been if you had 30 or so more cities to milk those last few hundred years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:lol: :lol: Now only if there was a way to get free workers every turn....It wouldn't be feasible to use that method for a milking game, since some cities would be losing population points to supply workers to that big city, only to be losing 1/turn due to starvation.<br />
<br />
But I'll go start a game and see if a city maxes out at size 999 or not.  Goal:  1 billion people in one city!</div></div><hr />

That happened to me as well.  In my ancient wars against the Babylonians and Persians I razed the cities I captured in order to rebuild cities in better spots.  Then in the second war with the Persians I had a democracy with the lux slider set high so I had gobs of happy people.  I razed one stinkin' Persian city and my democracy turned into anarchy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 22, 2002, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to Gramphos, the city size is saved as a signed 32 bit number.  Signed means that one of the bits is used as a + or -.  So unless there is some game mechanics limit, the maximum size would be 2^31 - 1 = 2147483647.  In a test where I changed the Workers to be worth 25 pop points I was able to build up a size 1025 city pretty quickly.  I have a save with about 800 Workers, at 25 pop points each that would give a city near 20k.  It takes a long time to move all the Workers and add them, and a significant delay when processing the +25 pop too.  Maybe if I get bored I'll see how big a city I can get.<br />

EDIT: Just ran a quick check in the editor, the pop points for each worker can be set up to 255.</div></div><hr />

When I had no room left, I started building horsemen. I was hoping to upgrade them to war elephants but my treasure was running low and i had to attack Babylon 280 ad.<br />

530 Bye bye Babylon! Now I upgraded my horsemen to elephants and built some more. 600ad at war against Persia.<br />

990 ad island is mine. Rushed FP in the middle of the bigger half of my continent.(Near Persepolis)<br />
<br />
1450 ad landed on the huge continent near Germany. Took 4 small German cities and made peace. Then started to destroy England. 1605 Elizabeth had only 1 city left, made peace.<br />
<br />
Then I decided to finish Germans. 1670 They were gone.<br />
<br />
1690 i was at war with everybody. England was destroyed fast. Landed near China too and got 4 cities in one turn. I made peace with Zulus but kept on capturing Japanese and Chinese cities.<br />

cities all over my half of the continent, found babs and persians.<br />
when i built a poorly defended city next to the ivory the persians<br />
came at me with warriors. what a joke. i pumped out some<br />
archers and a few horsemen once i hooked up the horses and took a city from them and declared peace. persians weren't in<br />
my plans yet. i stacked a few horsemen and attacked the<br />
babylonians once they built the oracle. there was no need to<br />
involve the persians but i did anyway. i took all babylonian<br />
cities on the continent, leaving them two cities on the island.<br />
the persians went after them and destroyed them.<br />
meanwhile, i had elephants and just declared war on the persians.<br />
<br />
they put up a gallant fight with their immortals but the outcome was obvious. i had all the wonders except the pyramids and was building up culture too fast (didn't know it then and wasn't really planning on it). i sent a few galleys to explore and we found the<br />
main continent. the zulus were at war with the chinese and were destroying them. i gave folks technology to see whether they could help along. no use.<br />
well, i left the persians some cities in the northwest cos i wanted to build up first.<br />
once i got cavalry i re-initiated hostilities against them and captured all their cities...and resumed building.<br />
some reckoning had to be done on the main continent cos that's where everything was. after the hoover dam, i built tons of infantry and tanks and transports.<br />
by this time the zulus had finished off the chinese, some wars were being fought on the easter front between the japanese, <br />
english and germans. routine trading of cities...no ground being really taken.<br />
the zulus declared war. i loaded up tanks into 4 tranports and attacked them. with my cultural rating no cities flipped and resistance took only 1 or 2 turns. <br />
basically it was airport invasion.<br />
<br />
with all the gold in the treasury, i would rush an airport at the frontlines and airlift the 10 or so tanks made each turn ( every city in the home continent had an airport). <br />
<br />
seeing as how my culture was growing too fast, i disbanded all the libraries....and then the cathedrals. after the zulu, it was the japanese. i had intended to take them out one by one if i could.<br />
culture was still growing too fast so i disbanded the temples. <br />
when i had all 8 luxuries i rushed marketplaces everywhere to take care of happiness. <br />
i got all the japanese territory and my cultural score was 98K+.<br />
so i researched fission and disbanded the universities and abandoned the 4 highest cultural cities in the homeland leaving the ones with smith trading and hoover. that reduced cultural growth to a steady 35/turn. i wanted to squeeze as many turns of milking as possible before the UN.<br />
i kept the english and germans happy by supplying them with techs and luxuries. i also researched synthentic fibres just in case they got antsy (it's funny research rate doesn't slow down much even without libraries and universities).<br />
a few turns before the end i made an MPP with elizabeth because she had made one with germany and couldn't have her voting for bismarck. i begged and cajoled her with deals.<br />
i built the UN and took the vote...one more turn and i would have triggered a cultural victory but she voted for me in 1942AD.<br />
<br />
i don't know what the scores are but i could have planned better of course...disbanding those temples, cathedrals and libraries in the 1700s.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes i found that weird too ~ I think it dropped 3 turns at most of my research rate which suggests here is some scaling issue there thats a bit wacky becuase it harldy seems worhthwhile to build them for that kind of difference.:crazyeye:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Justus II</div><div class="date">Apr 23, 2002, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally finished my first GOTM, and I really enjoyed it.  This was my first Cultural victory, intentional or otherwise, and so I also learned more about how the cultural aspects add up.   This was also my first game on Warlord (I started on Regent when I got the game), so there were some adjustments there too.<br />
<br />
Like most everyone, once I saw the bottleneck I hurried to settle there, then fill in the rest of my half of the continent.  I initially pushed a couple of other cities past the bottleneck, to settle near the Ivory, but Babylon had already gotten it within their borders, so I had to rush culture to push the borders back, which worked.  I did not notice that I had no iron until it was too late, the Babs had already settled that one too.  I concentrated on peacefully building, and got the Great Library, but with only contact of the two civs, and on Warlord, I soon realized I wasn’t going to get much tech from them.  I also was surprised to complete so many wonders, I am so used to the AI getting all the early ones.  Once I realized that, I tried to get them all, and after Pyramids and Oracle, I got every wonder.  <br />
<br />
With the Great Lighthouse, I started exploring, and two of my “suicide Galleys” made it to the other continent.  I soon was able to trade communications with all other civs, but did not initially give communications with the Persians or Babs.  I also did start getting some techs from the Great Library, including Monotheism.  About this same time I completed the Colossus, which triggered my Golden Age, around 350AD.  With that, I built Cathedrals in every city, and most of my core cities had run out of things to build.  This was when I started to think about a Culture victory.  I was only at 15 cities, a little under 4000 culture total, but by adding all these cathedrals, I knew it would start to grow.  It seemed that neither the Babylonians or Persians were building much culture, most of their cities only had a border of 1 tile.  <br />
I cranked out some more settlers and started building cities in the creases of their borders, as well as about 6 more cities on my half of the island.  I normally go for a pretty spread-out build to minimize overlap, but I decided to maximize culture I would need more cities, for more temple-library-cathedrals.<br />
<br />
I originally wasn’t too excited about playing India, I always thought the War Elephant was a wasted Unique Unit, with no advantages, but it really came in handy on this map, with no iron.  I used the rest of my golden age to crank out horsemen, planning to then upgrade them to War Elephants when I got Chivalry and Leo’s Workshop.  I did get a temporary trade deal with the persians for 20 turns, just before I got Fuedalism, so when it came I finished Sun Tzu and quickly upgraded a bunch of spearman to pikeman.<br />
Unfortunately I got impatient, because even with my growing culture, no cities defected over to me, so I invaded babylon with the horseman and a bunch of swordsman.  I made some quick progress until the Iron deal lapsed, and I still didn’t have Ashur, which was the Bab’s Iron city on a hill.  I finally pounded it down with catapults and my last few swordsmen.  I then made peace to rebuild, before finishing them off.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in 550 my golden age was over, and I stopped to look at my culture situation.  I was at nearly 7000 culture, growing by almost 200 per turn, but when I calculated out the doubling effects, which would be kicking in, I figured I would be at 25,000 by 1250 AD, growing by 360/turn.  This didn’t seem like it would be enough, so I knew I would need to build some more cities, or take them from the Babs/Persians.  Throughout all of this, I still had no Great Leaders, and no citys had flipped to me!  I rebuilt a new city at the site of Ashur, and built the population up with Indian workers from my home cities, to start building the Forbidden Palace.  By rushing Temple/Library/Cathedral/Courthouse/Market, I was able to get it up to a size 8 and keep it in WLTKD, which reduced corruption below 50%, so I could actually put about 6 shields per turn into it, but it still took like 35 turns.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I finished off the Babylonians, and prepared for my war against Persia.  I could see they now had two sources of Iron, so I sent galleys loaded with my first few elephants to wait off their coast near the iron.  When Leo’s workshop was done, I upgraded the rest of my horsemen and launched the invasion.  The turn before, I fnally got a Persian city (Arbela) to flip to me, so I could push my invasion forces a little closer to his core.  Unfortunately, he had already developed Fuedalism, so I took some serious losses against his pikeman, but I took about half his cities over the next couple centuries.  By then, we had gunpowder, and the elephants were not doing so well, so I negotiated peace.  Still no leaders.  I focused on rushing culture buildings in my new cities.  My core cities, since they had run out of things to build, began a modified caravan approach, and started cranking out elephants and catapults, which I would then move to the newer cities and disband, to boost production.  Especially before the FP was completed, it helped me finish many libraries and cathedrals.  <br />
<br />
By now my plan was to have temple/library/cathedral in every city, and a colosseum and University in every city greater than size 7.  By 1250 with persia down to about 5 cities, I had about 48.  I never did attempt to settle on the big continent, in fact other than tech sales, I had almost no dealings with the other civs at all, until near the end.  At this point, I knew I was going for culture victory, and I had enough cities on my continent already.  If I got too many more, corruption would be too high, and it would take even more micromanagement.  Anyway, in 1250 I had nearly 30,000 culture, and growing by 400 per turn.  The next stretch, to 1450, saw a huge increase, as all those buildings built in my golden age doubled, and I built up the old Persian cities.  By 1450 I had almost 60,000 culture and growing by 850 per turn.  I continued to complete all the wonders as they came available.  I had been shooting to hit the 100,000 by 1750, but now I thought I could do a little better than that. <br />
<br />
 I was almost on cruise control when “Persia and Zululand sign a military alliance against you!!”  The Persians struck fast, taking out a bunch of workers and some cannons, but no cities.  I pumped up research (I had been cranking out cash to rush colosseums), and got Cavalry in 4 turns.  I also got a leader!  An elite elephant from the last war took out an Immortal, and Chandragupta appears!  I used him to build an army, so I could fill it with cav and write the Heroic Epic.  By this time I was within 5 turns of finishing Newtons, Smiths, Magellans and Shakespeare in four different cities, and knew the AI was going very slow with wonders.  Anyway, I paid the Chinese, Japanese and Germans with tech to go after the Zulus, and I attacked the persians.  After I took a couple more cities, I was able to get peace, and two more cities, leaving them with only the capital and Samaria.  This was about 1600, so I just kept cranking out culture, and watching the turns tick by.  I did rush to build hospitals in most of my cities, so population would grow, and my luxuries kept most everyone happy, but I don’t have the patience to truly “milk” a game for score.  At this point I was just happy to beat my target date for the culture victory, which I finally did in 1680.  <br />
<br />
Like I said, lots of fun, I had never done that before.  The beginning part of the game was fun too, almost reminded me of Civ2, lots of food, easy expansion, docile AI, getting every wonder!  Anyway, looking forward to next month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2002, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Time to start telling my game story, although I am not sure whether I can finish it in time due to the huge amount of time my studies take up right now. :o <br />
<br />
Anyway, a Warlord level game was really something interesting again, this time I was the one to have approx. the double amount of cities at the same time than the AI, at least in the beginning. I began fighting Babylon pretty soon, they respawned a little to the north though. I was way ahead in tech compared to the Persian and took out the last Babylonians around 1AD.<br />
A military campaign against Persia was not feasible, darn those Immortals.<br />
Built the GL, Colossus and HG, just finished the GW and Sun Tzu´s.<br />
I crossed the ocean shortly after finishing the GL, made contact with all the other Civs but trade agreements weren´t really profitable.<br />
Unfortunately the English suddenly declared war and a bit later several other joined in, despite having no means nor enough military power to threaten me. The main continent is still partly free for settlement, especially the jungle regions. I am  supporting the Germans a bit but right now other matters are at hand.<br />
The indian army has just been fully upgrade to medieval time and our campaign against Persia is about to start soon. :cool:<br />
<br />
It really is a relaxing game at this level but it still takes a lot of time. Still not sure which winning route to go, but probably not culture.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creepster</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2002, 10:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I just submitted my first GOTM.  I didn't finish in time to submit last month.  My game is fairly consistant with what I have read above.  My two biggest problems were over estimating the AI,  (I should have attacked much earlier and more aggresively),  and in not having a planned approach to my victory type (domination,cultural etc.).  I ended up winning a cultural victory (seems to be the popular choice this month), but my score was not very impressive.  I got too board to really try milking the game.  Toward the end I just wanted it over.:(</div></div><hr />

Remeber difficulty level affects the score, so multiply by 2 to get what your score would be in a monarch level game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2002, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am royally pissed off at the Japanese for destroying my game. I was all set to finish my game, everything set up perfectly, no need to do anything but hit spacebar for the final 100 turns. It took countless hours to get to this point where I finally had the brutal part of milking finished: all cities founded, territory 10 tiles below domination limit, all citizens happy, etc. <br />
<br />
Then the F-ing Japanese declare war out of the blue and attack with their pathetic forces. :mad: :mad: They took 2 citites by throwing 10 cavs at each. Why did they fight me? The assholes probably wanted my oil, which I had a world monopoly on. Even though all I did was defend my territory, massive war weariness broke out in all my cities, forcing a switch to monarchy. :mad: <br />
<br />
Then my allies began razing Japanese cities. I realized this when I saw the dominion limit being reached rapidly as my cutural borders expanded to fit in the gaps. I can see what's going to happen next, but there is no way to get rid of a size 15 city in one turn. I start frantically trying to starve citites down to size to get rid of them, but it's no use. 1922: you have reached a domination victory. <br />
<br />
NO!!! Do you have any idea how much time I spent on this game? :mad: Everything was set for my 7200 score game until the AI ruined it. I did NOT mess up with the domination limit; the AI caused me to go over it by razing cities. And I couldn't stop it because I was using the 1.17 patch. <br />
<br />
If I was using 1.21 I could have prevented this from happening; I fully saw what was going to happen. Hardly fair. I'm going to finish this game with the new patch and post what my final score would have been; it would definitely be higher than the 5500 that the goddamn Japanese imposed on me. :mad: So much for the 40 or so hours I worked on creating my perfect game.</div></div><hr />

Its one of the reasons i took the extra time to almost completely get rid of the other civs 1st. :splat:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bamspeedy</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2002, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did pretty much the same as you, Rain.  I was probably 50 or so tiles from domination, then just started razing all the AI civs, so I wouldn't have to worry about them.  Building cities near AI cities, you not only worry about razed cities (which admittedly I never would have really thought about), but taking tiles by culture, is what I would worry about.<br />
<br />
When I got down to the last city I was to settle, Instead of claiming 9 more tiles (which would give me the most # of tiles before domination, I had to grab only 8 tiles.  Why?  Because I had 1 island city, down by Germany's former land that had 1 tile being taken from it by an England city's culture.  I knew eventually I would reclaim that 1 tile, so I had to save territory for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2002, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, well you don't expect to be GAINING tiles when you have 0 culture everywhere except wonder cities and you never plan on taking another AI city. I though 10 tiles would be pretty safe; but when the Zulus razed two cities in one turn... well there wasn't much I could so about it. I will definitely be glad that I can use the abandon city feature in future games. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fossil</div><div class="date">Apr 25, 2002, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went for an early culture victory.  There were a few interesting plays in my game:<br />
<br />
Popping huts <br />
<br />
At Warlord level, there is a 200% advantage in fighting barbarians.  So, when barbs are popped, most of the time you get an elite unit for your trouble.  Anticipating this, I created a number of warriors, attempting to get several elites. I got three elite warriors this way.<br />
<br />
One of them cashed in, attacking a lone archer, creating a GL in (I think) 420 AD.<br />
<br />
Building out <br />
<br />
My third and fourth cities were at the choke point.  Then I back-filled and build in &quot;my&quot; area.  I went for a &quot;land grab&quot; initially, then an ICS later.  I suspect that an immediate ICS might be a better early-culture strategy.  The problem with immediate ICS is that AI civs can grab too much land, and it takes time and effort to wrest it away.<br />
<br />
Cities adjacent to water would ultimately use mostly water tiles, so I built a second row of cities just inland from the water's edge.  It looked like two concentric rings of cities.<br />
<br />
The Forbidden Palace was placed adjacent to the iron (thanks, Babs, I needed that!).  There was a mix of hills and grassland - ideal for getting high-production cities that can produce wonders. I built three wonder-producing cities there, stuffing in workers to get them up to size 12.<br />
<br />
Once every available tile was occupied, excess food and population was not helpful.  I wanted more production to speed up the build-out of culture-producing improvements.  So, I reforested quite a bit of the land.<br />
<br />
Waging war <br />
<br />
Preparation was key.  In the BC's I built an army of veteran warriors and archers in anticipation of taking the iron, and upgrading the warriors to swordsman.  This meant I needed cash, so I kept research at 0 to 10%, and traded for techs (one scientist has the same impact as 10% on research - 40 turns).  <br />
<br />
I got 50 gold for introducing the Babs to the Persians (they had cities with borders only two tiles away from each other).  :crazyeye:<br />
<br />
My swordsman made short work of the Babs (they had a single city at the north tip of the continent, which was too remote to bother with at that time. I took it later).<br />
<br />
Then probably the most interesting war strategy - I built roads in the &quot;in-between&quot; areas through the Persian territory, right up to their iron.  Two stacks of four spearman each (one stack by land, one by sea) moved just outside Persian territory, next to their two iron sources.<br />
<br />
I retreated my workers, and declared war on the Persians.  All their immortals killed themselves attacking my spearmen which were fortified on the iron mountain.  Then...no more immortals.  :slay:<br />
<br />
The roads I built sped up my attack, and without their immortals, the outcome of the Persian war was never in doubt.<br />
<br />
Golden Age <br />
<br />
I triggered a golden age with the Lighthouse just after creating the FP.  This meant that my empire had two central cores during the GA, and I used it to build temples and libraries, which were completed prior to 500 AD.  I got an &quot;echo effect&quot; from the GA a thousand years later, when all those buildings doubled their culture output.<br />
<br />
A new continent <br />
<br />
As I was running out of room on the starting continent by 700 AD, I needed more space.  The jungle area of the main continent was unsettled, and had two luxuries.  So...a flood of settlers went off to a new land.<br />
<br />
By this time, the other civs were also space-constrained, and there was a race for the remaining territory.  I got most of it, and culture-flipped five of the cities from other civs.<br />
<br />
Head I win, tails Zulus <br />
<br />
I was polite with the remaining civs.  Research was proceeding at a snail's pace - I was emphasizing cash to buy improvements (I was in monarchy for most of the game).  Then in 1335 the Zulus attacked.  I brought everyone else in against them.  I made little effort in the war beyond defending myself.<br />
<br />
A few turns later China changed sides and attacked me.  I realized later that they had made a deal with me that was ruinously expensive for them, and this was their way out.  I guess you have to be careful when you've blinded the other civs with your culture.  Again, I brought the other civs in against my opponent, and did little.<br />
<br />
When the wars were ended (exactly 20 turns later), I went to democracy, put research down to zero, and spent all my cash on cultural improvements.<br />
<br />
The last few turns I was generating over 1,500 culture per turn.</div></div><hr />

I built Calcutta at the chokepoint in 1375BC, then got rid of the babs between 350BC and 200AD. Next on the list: the Persians of course, terminated in 620AD.<br />
About 2 centuries at peace, preparing my landing in England with a bunch of superb War Elephants. Then allout war till I was granted domination.<br />

It can happen if you find the enemy early, while there are still islands unsettled.  Also, a player &quot;milking&quot; the game will conquor up to the domination limit and then raze all but one enemy city, and then proceed to max out his exsisting cities.  the player might then choose to win the game by elimanting the remaining rival city.</div></div><hr />

Check out Sullla's post on this thread at Apr 24, 2002 04:31 PM. He is attempting to avoid the domination win in order to milk the score. His attempt failed, but was a worthy attempt at this strategy. <br />

I thought I could leave the AI alone for the most part after the initial land grab, hoping for a peaceful win diplomatically in 2050.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">Apr 28, 2002, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I submitted my game a week ago and there are only a few days left, so...<br />
<br />
My wars against Babylon started at 630 BC. I sued for peace and received a couple of smaller towns. I was back filling during this time and completed the Pyramids in 310 BC. I wanted this wonder to help with growth over the ages. I then had a brief scuffle with the Persians around the ivory and later settled for one of their small northern towns.<br />
<br />
Around 100 AD I was ready to spread over the continent so I proceeded to take out the Babylonians. At 210 AD the war was over, however I would find later that they had a settlement over on the small island.<br />
<br />
At 270 AD I began the Persian wars. They really provided little resistance and they were eliminated in 360 AD. Then I proceeded to develop my home continent. I wanted to groom every square mile.<br />
<br />
I settled my first city on the large continent in 580 AD over by the Chinese. They had very little culture and I just kept building in the gaps and pressing my culture to open up new building sites via ICS style growth.<br />
<br />
Around 600 AD I settled a city on the small island to keep the Babs company.<br />
<br />
By 990 AD I had assimilated almost 50% of the Chinese territory. Around this time I had had discovered navigation and had my first settlement over by the English.<br />
<br />
I had been on Polite terms with everyone and then the English declared war on me. At this time I was the only civ with Chivalry and took my elephants (the elephants only war of the ages) over to do some stomping. I also got the Germans to go to war with the English. By 1220AD,  I had made my point to the English but it seemed that the Germans had used the opportunity for some northern expansion. It was not until my game summary replay that I saw that they had actually taken these towns from the English. Oops, I would later take them out of the game before I finished the English based off this poor military intelligence.<br />
<br />
In 1260 I started my campaign against the Chinese with Cavalry. Since we were almost coexisting I was able to capture 7 of their cities on the first turn without a ROP agreement in effect. In 1270 I started destroying the German civilization. I was strong enough to proceed with fighting on two main fronts. By 1300 both the Germans and the Chinese were essentially finished off, each only had one city left at this point. I had also pretty well established any new cities in these areas that I wanted for future development.<br />
<br />
In 1325 I started my campaign against the Zulu and in 1335 the campaign against the English. By 1365 both these campaigns were finished. My cavalry was very strong against all the competition and none of them had yet even discovered chivalry.<br />
<br />
In 1375 I started against my last foe, the Japanese. They were the strongest yet but did not have samurai until about the third turn into the war. The last Japanese city fell in 1420. By this time there was only one Babylonian city left on the small island by the smaller continent. All other civs were gone.<br />
<br />
I was already pretty far along the milking stage of the game. This is were I really think that I did this incorrectly. I now think that ICS is best for milking because you have to get hospitals and ecology to build real big cities. Anyway I built a lot of big cities and had an ICS development in what used to be the Chinese area on the large continent.<br />
<br />
At the end I had a civilization population of about 18 billion people. I had one city with about 12 billion and another city with about 5 billion people.<br />
<br />
I ended up with a score closer to 9000 than 8000.<br />

It was a pretty leisurely affair, as I had cut my teeth on Regent a couple of times up until now. I have to admit I didn't pay too much attention to cultural points (actually, I had to go and check what I had after reading some of the posts here: a healthy 57,000 in 1808--not bad for not really knowing how culture works!)<br />
<br />
I ended up winning by domination in 1808, after wiping out the Babs and the Persians and then getting dragged into a war I didn't really want with the Germans and the Japanese. Poor English got caught in the crossfire and were decimated, except for a pet city I decided to let live, far to the south of their once proud land. After razing the Japanese to the ground and pushing the Zulus up close into the Chinese, the game suddenly ended!<br />
<br />
I guess I should have been counting tiles, but I'm not even sure how to do that. :crazyeye:<br />
<br />
I didn't get a single GL until something like the 1700's, either. Is this a Warlord-level thing? I was certainly in enough bloody battles with elites!<br />
<br />
BTW, is it common knowledge that, when you win twice in battle in the same turn with a tank, it gets an automatic upgrade? I think the funnest part of this game for me was sending my tanks to 'elite training school' before real battles, by making them attack the silly Zulus and the ineffective stacks of archers they insisted on sending my way. :lol:<br />

Without firing a single shot, we gained control of almost all of the home continent, and the southern part of the main continent over about its entire length. Many Babylonian, Persian and Chinese cities had joined India. We had all the luxuries, strategic resources,  and wonders, more than 80 cities to micro-manage, and the rest of the game would be boring. Milking is not my cup of tea.<br />

<br />
I really should start playing earlier. :crazyeye:<br />
<br />
But anyway, for such an easy game it took way too long. Due to the map size it is my highest score so far in my HoF.<br />
<br />
I wiped everyone out and left only 2 cities in the jungle, 1 german, 1 english. I surrounded them with enough modern units to quell any resistance and counter any attempt to settle. :cool:<br />
<br />
I set it up so I could achieve a diplo victory in 2050AD but no matter how much I gifted these to, they stayed furious with me. Not sure whether it was due to the blockade (but I had RoPs with em both) or the fact that I razed all their other cities because of the domination limit. :lol:<br />
<br />
So in the end I had the choice between a space ship, a conquest, a domination and a retirement victory OR a diplo LOSS. The score is not effected by this, so I choose the diplo loss, because for any awards it didn´t matter.<br />
<br />
So my highest score is a LOSS! :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Not a bad game but with no challenge, so I´m eagerly waiting to start the Deity game.<br />
I´ll try not to be too late!<br />
