- TIE-fighters based in Tattoine were given orders to specifically target the treasonous Victory II squadron that defected to the Republic, and they destroyed it with ease.<br />
<br />
- More surprises are coming for you there, just you wait.  I'd retreat if I were you, unless you want your entire fleet destroyed for one crumby desert planet.  You know and I know that no unit in that fleet is powerful enough to beat a veteran turbo laser (let alone two) without massive sacrifices.<br />

<br />
This month lord Vader landed outside Tattooine and singlehandedly destroyed three units there in a battle so fierce that all life on the planet died (the city disappeared).  All that remains on the planet is a heavily damaged rebel bomber.  This craft, along with the TIE-fighter escorting a task force on the way to Gallofree, has no place to refuel and therefore they will die within the next turn.  Furthermore, several Victory II's and one Imperator are a month away from the battle zone to scrape up whatever is left of this pathetic rabble.  :D<br />
<br />
My Victory II is just roaming around looking for weak unaligned planets to conquer. <br />
<br />
Hmm, then why have they turned away from two unaligned planets and toward Kessel?  Do you wish for me to repeat Tattoine there?</div></div><hr />

Becuase I just realised I am allied with the unalligned (is that an oxymoron or what?) and I can't break the alliance. Feel free to destroy the V2s, they are obsolete anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At most, we can say weakened.  For whenever we lose a planet, our resolve grows exponentially.<br />
<br />
Remnants of the Tatooine Force assault Gallofree, destroying it, and killing darth vader in the process.  Apparently his food supplies from Gallofree couldn't get sent, and he starved to death on the surface of Tatooine.  Imperial star destroyers were also bombed to little tiny morsels by our bombers.<br />
<br />
The rumors of enemy Imperator class cruisers are believed, but not feared, as they most certainly came from Kuat Drive Yards, and even in hyperspace would not reach our mini-fleet.</div></div><hr />

Speaking of Buffer Planets, my intrepid cruiser that escaped from Gallofree took Varl.  I'm suprised all the luck I've been having against Turbolasers with my speeders.  Maybe perhaps because all my experiences against Turbolasers in Singleplayer games were with city walls too.</div></div><hr />

Well it is probably equivalent to 30 units of production (food or energy or minerals) lost each turn because some girls have to become prostitute themselves instead of working. And/or I have had to create additional units for garrison duties.</div></div><hr />

I think the prob that Barbs appear from huts increases with each hut that is discovered. Since there aren't many huts, it is less likely to happen. When they do appear, it says you encountered pirates or something and the barb unit has a black shield.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I have come to think that Industry Level 2 is really the manufacturing plant, and 3 is the nuclear/power plant.  Because you can build 3 before 2, or 2 before 3.  I'd have to look at the icons for the game and compare them with the Civ2 icons to be sure.<br />

Most players never realise how much time goes into planning the scenario. That's what makes the difference, not nice looking units and terrain. Sadly in this decadent world, most players only care about the visual impact.<br />

BTW turbo lasers and laser turrents are but mere toys to the YZV Worldships and the attack bugs will simply suicide themselves destroying any carefully planned defenses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At 1900 Byss Time today, protected by fighter screens, the Imperial 6th fleet dropped out of hyperspace near Kessel. Although disappointed to see the system so poorly defended, elements of the 3rd Orbital Assault Corps that accompanied the 6th Fleet proceeded to land on the only habitable planet and quickly took out the enemy's shield generators. Thereafter orbital bombardment made short work of defending 2nd Imperium forces (one puny garrison unit) and the system was in Imperial hands within a few scant hours.<br />
<br />
According to Grand Admiral Thrawn who was in command of the assault, this is only the initial stages of a new campaign, code-named 'Double-meat Burger', which will be coordinated with the New Republic. Our viewers will find it not very difficult to guess who is the 'meat' and who will be doing the sandwiching. At the end he added &quot;A training ship manned by monkeys would have been sufficient. My task force may be small compared to the Home Fleet but I wish the emperor would give my boys some real work to do.&quot; <br />
<br />
Later when interviewed at the Imperial Palace, Emperor Palpatine had this to say: &quot; Up till now I have refrained from attacking Imperium Forces because of my Buddhist beliefs (well, except for destroying an un-manned probe in the no-fly zone). The Imperium has ignored my warnings not to build weapons of mass destruction (i.e. their DeathStar) a total of 16 times and even destroyed some of our inspection fleets. Now I realize that a trade embargo is insufficient and I must reluctantly take more affirmative action or run the risk of becoming irrelevant.&quot;<br />
<br />
As an after thought, the Emperor mumbled, &quot;I must apologize to our New Republic allies who have spearheaded the fight against the terrorist 2nd Imperium. I confess I have been distracted by a 2-D entertainment signal from beyond our galaxy called 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' whose main star, the Master, bears a striking resemblance to myself. Sign! Vanity is such a vice.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />

At least you have better fighters and bombers, speedy ground units and great wonders. Just survive and you will prevail.....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just a bit more on the distinction between laser turret and turbo laser. Turbo laser's double defense (pikeman) against ground units doesn't work against the Rebels speedy units cause they have a move allowance of more than 2. The Imperial powers AT-ST and AT-AT both have a move of 2. This is another compensating factor for the Rebels.<br />
<br />
Anyone interested in the distinction between frigates and carriers?<br />
<br />
Both can carry strikecraft.<br />
Both have double defense against strikecraft.<br />
Both can see fighters (submarines)<br />
<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
A frigate is cheaper and can attack units on land or in space.<br />
A frigate can kill strikecraft and strikecraft can kill a frigate.<br />
A carrier cannot attack anything including strikecraft but strikecraft will find it very hard to kill a carrier because of the combo of <br />
<br />
   1. Aegis flag<br />
   2. Double hit points <br />
   3. Higher defence factor than frigates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is a sample entry <br />
<br />
Zaarin    <br />
an Imperial Admiral in service during the Galactic Civil War. He was placed in charge of the research and development of new TIE Fighter models, including the the TIE Advanced and TIE Defender, by Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader. He negotiated with the Habeen to obtain TIE hyperdrive technology. While he openly supported the Emperor's plans to capture Admiral Harkov following the defection of his fleet, Zaarin was plotting to move his fleet to Coruscant to kill Palpatine. Using the cover of Imperial fighters, he outraced Imperial pursuit in the Glory and reached Coruscant ahead of Vader, but was unable to capture Palpatine's shuttle. Vice Admiral Thrawn arrived and chased Zaarin into hyperspace. Zaarin later re-appeared, and tried to steal the prototype cloaking device design from Thrawn. Zaarin nearly succeeded, capturing a CR90 corvette equipped with a cloaking device from the research lab in the Iast System. However, Zaarin attempted to flee into hyperspace with the ship cloaked. The cloaking device had not yet been perfected for use in hyperspace, and the device exploded. The corvette and her crew, including Zaarin were destroyed upon entering hyperspace. <br />
<br />

<br />
keep in mind in the 'real' Star Wars universe the rebellion by Zaarin failed - the name second Imperium is made up by me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Emperor in his mercy has forgiven Admiral Kobi.<br />
<br />
<br />
My bad. :( <br />
<br />
I thought it would be like ZWK where in a stack with capital ships and fighters, the ship would be the defender when attacked by an enemy fighter. Stacking many ships theoretically should have required an infinite number of enemy fighters to kill the stack.<br />
<br />
I guess its not the case in SWIns. In retrospect, its probably because capital ships only have 1 HP in SWIns. Well there goes half my homefleet. :cry: .......and I was really positioned well to win in spite of the Imperium's bigger size - now we probably have the same number of ISDs.

<br />
I can't believe it either; with veterancy your ships had defense of 24!  Regardless of hit points this was surprising.<br />
<br />
Nice historical parallel btw, this was just a stroke of luck. :cool:  Although I think even before the battle we had an equal number of ISD's.  You might have had more carriers/frigates, but that's it.  <br />
<br />
Shame too, I wanted to see how my defenses in Spira would fare.  I obviously can't tell you anything, but you would have had a tough time.  I had enough defensive units for you to expend all your movement points without taking it, and then I had well-placed space and ground counterattack forces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
regards to the stack,<br />
<br />
No stroke of luck here. As the maker of the scenario, I should have been more familiar with the battle mechanics. The defense factor of the ISDs wasn't a factor. Seems that if all units in the stack have the same HP, the fighter defends. I would have been probably ok if the fighter wasn't in the stack but then vulnerable to attack by bombers and capitalships. So there is no ideal stack configuration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Boy, are you a bad liar.  More like &quot;did nothing, except for pushing forward a large contingent of my Byss fleet, and also sent several Imperators to assist the Unaligned near Chamble.&quot;<br />
<br />
- Apparently Palpatine has not learned his lesson from the Battle of Spira, so our proud home fleet has been forced to teach it again.  In a quick action involving our first-ever fleet carrier and several of our 10+ ISD's, our fleet destroyed every Imperial ship foolish enough to venture starnorth of Spira, with the exception of one enemy frigate found out of range.  Considering this great victory was made possible by only 10% of our total fleet, our citizen's hopes are up for the defense of the Corruscan sector.<br />
<br />
- Meanwhile, upon recon reports that an Imperial fleet nears Bacrana, the battered remnants of our disastrous attack on Chamble are returning to Bacrana... in shambles.  Hahaha, I crack myself up.  <br />
<br />
- The fall of Pypin marks the end of the CSA. :evil:<br />
<br />
Where were you expecting to go with those ships, Kobi?  A kamikaze raid?</div></div><hr />

I wonder how you know where all my ships are without even using probe droids? Especially in the case of the upper ISD. Why would you send a TIE all the way up there? :confused: My ships were definitely beyond visual range of Spira. Just plain luck I guess. In all the passes I made with my probes, you never ever moved your ships north of Spira.<br />

<br />
CHamble, Najiba and Bacrana are planets mentioned in the Star Wars Adventure Journals.<br />
<br />
http://www.swrpg.net/supplements/planetguide/source.htm<br />
<br />
Najiba is a remote planet covered with wetlands, and lashed with atmospheric electrical discharges and constant rainstorms. Najiba, a low-technology world with a high degree of smuggling activity, is located a mere one- hour's hyperspace travel from the Trulalis system. During one half of its elliptical orbit, Najiba passes near a hazardous asteroid belt known as the &quot;Children of Najiba,&quot; at which time all travel to and from the planet is restricted. The inhabitants of Najiba tend to be superstitious and wary of strangers, but are also extremely loyal and hardworking. Around three million humans and Najib inhabit the planet. Reuther's Wetdock is a popular tavern located near the planet's spaceport. Sometime before the Battle of Endor, the Dark Jedi Adalric Brandl hired the smuggler Thaddeus Ross to take him from Najiba to Trulalis, Brandl's former home. <br />
<br />
As for Bacrana, sometime after the Battle of Yavin, a large demonstration against Imperial rule in the Central Sector of Bacrana's large city Amma erupted in violence. Imperial forces under the command of Moff Ramier put down the riot without any help from the local Bacrana System Defense Force. Following the incident, the city of Amma was placed under martial law.<br />
<br />
Chamble is located in the Mid-Rim and home to the corporate offices for Bansche Tech, a major manufacturer of black-market assassin droid components. Sometime after the Battle of Yavin, Imperial officials nationalized Bansche Tech along with several other droid corporations, and set up garrisons around Chamble's manufacturing plants.</div></div><hr />
