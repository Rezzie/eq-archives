The archer closest to LC will go for it, if it kills our war. there, Elle can be there to save LC, i think. Will the other barb follow the first to LC, or will it head south to doughnutia. If the latter can Elle get back in time.  What does everyone think?<br />
<br />
The nonshielded grasslad, next to the plains square on the small pennisula between Neumatic and Doughnutia, wuold be a good spot for a city. Also the plains spot next to the barb leader (and archer) seems like a good future city spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Apr 22, 2003, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that Ellie should be dispatched. My only concern is that Doughnutia will be left undefended, but if needed we could switch production. If the archer moves SE onto the GLS, Ellie can kill it. If it moves to the forest, Ellie can be in LC in time to stop the barbs taking it if the warrior dies.<br />
<br />
Can I suggest building a dip in LC next, as this is where the Barbs seem to like taking their holidays at the moment!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Apr 22, 2003, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While the men of learning play with their quill pens the city defenses stay as thin as parchment. BUILD DIPLOMATS !!!!! :D<br />
<br />
Yes, it seems we really need a diplomat near LC and some reserve cash. Also I think that now that we have 8 cities we should start improving the terrain where doing so is really useful. IMO the settler S of RF should build a road where it is. This makes it slightly easier to send units between cities in emergencies. When this is finished the settler should found a city; there are just 2 nice city spots left on the western part of our continent, the grassland square next to the whale WSW of the barbs and the grassland square between two forest squares SE of LC and ENE of Doughnutia.<br />
<br />
Also I think it might be a good idea to station the elephant on the bananas where it has a short way to go to the most important cities (RF, LC and Neumatic - Doughnutia isn't big enough yet to be as valuable as the other three even though it's our designated SSC).<br />
<br />
Finally, it's becoming possible (but hardly likely - yet) that the land east of Ipec is the land we see west of LC/Doughnutia.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Already done!:D (Sorry, it's not easy to see on the map as it is shown here).<br />
<br />
Should Doughnutia build a guard warrior next before the Colossus, or should we get another city to build one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Apr 22, 2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remind me: we said no bribing cities, but bribing units is okay?  That would be important if we plan to counter the continuing barb threats with dips :D  I would suggest our next city, with good guards already in place, be founded (in the best city location) near where the barbs keep showing up.  That may not stop sea based barbs from appearing, but it would give them a target other than our capital and SSC, and if we stock it with some good defenses and dips, would be a healthy defense for the rest of our homeland.  An alternative would be to found a city and leave it open for the barbs to take and then start buying barb archers, but that would be risky so near the heart of our empire.<br />
<br />
It's beginning to look like we may need Map Making soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Apr 22, 2003, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sir Leowind, you are correct. No city bribing, but we can bribe units. <br />
<br />
I also agree we need Mapmaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Apr 22, 2003, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We're being pretty unlucky with the barbs:( <br />
One idea is to buy the barb, by maxing out the taxes for one turn (get as much trade in our cities excpt Neumatic and 70% tax) which will give us 22 gold for next turn. Also we switch temple to dip, disband warrior (LC will need entertainer) and RB (war-pha-dip). This will give us 69 by next turn and we'll be able to buy the archer for 61g. If the other archer follows first one, we'll kill it with archer, if it goes for Dou, we'll kill it with ellie. This would take care of the problem, but we'll slow down growth and techs a bit and lose a bunch of money.<br />
Assume this falls under military advisor though.:) <br />
<br />
The southern settler I propose found a city NE of western whale on GL. Settler outside RF I think would be great for building roads, either directly to Neumatic or first to the hill two squares away from both LP and EF and then down to Neumatic. <br />
Any objections?<br />
<br />
Another alternative is to found a city on the forest (after irrigating it) 2E2NE of Dou.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Apr 22, 2003, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rushing a dip and bribing the archer was my first thought, but now I'm not so sure.  It depends on where the elephant is and when she can get to LC.  I wouldn't go nuts to buy the archer if the elephant can get there in time to kill it.  62g plus disbanding a warrior and RBing a dip is a lot to pay for one supported archer.  If the 2nd archer and leader (I assume that's what's stacked there) head toward Doughnutia, I'd probably switch from Temple to a RB Phalanx there.  If the archer and leader go that way, a fortified phalanx on a hill should be able to easily withstand an archer, then the leader will be there for the taking by the elephant. Then we'll have enough cash to buy them when they come back in about 3 turns :rolleyes:   The plalanx will help with martial law and will make that city safe from most attacks.<br />
<br />
It's still a good idea to get a dip around there, but I'm not sure that's the best response to this immediate situation.<br />
<br />
I'd probably send the RF settler building roads for a while unless it is causing support issues - first the Sheilded grass NE of RF and the buffalo, then build across to LP to aid mutual defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">Apr 22, 2003, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As military advisor, I would advise that the Elephant should be dispatched and see what it can do. If it takes damage into the yellow, pull it back to LC and rush a Diplomat to bribe it. Also, I will agree with Tim's plan for defense. If we cannot spare a phalanx, just rush one. Otherwise take one from one of our eastern/central cities (can't say exactly since I'm at school and don't have Civ2 with me). I also agree, send RF setteler to build roads. I don't think it would cause any support issues, but I'm not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blissful_Zen</div><div class="date">Apr 23, 2003, 06:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like being on the offensive, but sometimes the situation warrants a defensive stand.  If we move the Phalanx from Neumatic to LC now, it will be there and fortified to thwart the 2nd attack from the barb archer.  This would allow us to keep Ellie south near Doughnutia incase the other barbs head that way.<br />
<br />
We should have a settler building roads, we need to increse trade.  The GrassLand spot 5SW of Neu is a quality spot for a city. Also i like the idea of putting a city in the area where the barbs keep landing.  I think we should start the Colousus in Dou next, and makin the defense for it in another city ahead of time (soon).<br />
<br />
A good city name would be Point Blissful, and/or  Mt. Zen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Apr 23, 2003, 07:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Neumatic could let the Phalanx away for a while, so maybe we should do it in case. Still, I don't think the phalanx would have a clear victory unless it's fortified (remember LC is on river).<br />
<br />
RF doesn't have any support problems, since it's working the banana and is defended by a NON archer. It supports ellie, two settlers and have a surplus of 2f each turn.<br />
<br />
Enchanted Forest (a filler) will be done with its warrior in 3, what shall we build next? Either we build a caravan to support wonder-building or we build a settler for improvements or founding a city between EF and Naervana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Researching Map Making is a good idea.  Also Pottery will be needed soon enough.  We are going to change Neu's wonder to the HG's, since we are playing diety.</div></div><hr />

Living up to it's role as a filler, I would expect EF to be a Camel Farm.  With The SSC so far to the W, building another city to the east right away won't help us with our immediate goals as much as a Camel will.  Naervana and it's offspring can handle colonizing the &quot;mid-east&quot; region of the island, as there's only a couple decent city sites left between there and EF.  Ipecac can colonize the far southeastern areas.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2003, 09:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a long message so I'm dividing it into several sections.<br />
<br />
Dealing with barbarians<br />
<br />
In my opinion we must incrementally rush buy a diplomat in LC no later than now. The elephant can't reach LC in time to kill the barbarian archer closer to LC before it attacks LC. Ditto for Neumatic's phalanx. This barbarian attack would reduce LC's size by one since a non-veteran warrior has almost no chance against an archer. Preventing LC's size reduction is in itself enough to justify the $$ spent on a diplomat and bribes but apart from this a diplomat is useful.<br />
<br />
After buying the diplomat we'll set taxes to maximum (70%) and adjust production in all cities to get as much $$ from taxes as possible (one problem: Doughnutia will probably revolt if the elephant leaves it). Actually I prefer keeping taxes at maximum for 2 or 3 turns to build cash reserves.<br />
<br />
After raising taxes, on the turn after buying the diplomat we'll have just enough $$ to bribe the first barbarian archer to prevent it from reducing LC's size by attacking (this assumes the archer moves directly towards LC). Then we can use either the archer or elephant to kill the other barbarian archer if it also moves towards LC (probably the archer; it means we could keep the elephant in Doughnutia).<br />
<br />
After all this we'll have an archer and diplomat to defend LC; LC is a very valuable supporting city for Doughnutia and Neumatic. We also have one interesting thing to do with the former barbarian archer: Fortify it on the mountain SE of LC to create a 'barbarian trap' thus hoping for more barbarians to appear. These would die attacking our archer and our archer would then get the barbarian leader.<br />
<br />
Finally, I propose we call our next city &quot;Barbarians SUCK !!!!!&quot;, especially if we happen to build it near the barbarians that are now bothering us.<br />
<br />
Production in cities and other domestic matters<br />
<br />
LC's production should be adjusted to use the special. This increases production and trade. Once Neumatic's size reaches 3 production there should be maximized by using forest squares.<br />
<br />
We also need to irrigate at least one rive square there. Mining a hill would also be useful.<br />
<br />
A road between RF and LP would be useful but before building it we should build a road on the buffalo square.<br />
<br />
Once LC finishes its temple it should build settlers to found a city on the grassland square next to the whale near the barbarians.<br />
<br />
We should rush buy the Doughnutia temple as soon as possible and then start a wonder (it might be a good idea to keep taxes at maximum for several turns to do this).<br />
<br />
LP should probably build a settler after its temple. This would be useful for improving the land near our core cities. We have 8 cities now so we can start paying some attention to roads, irrigation and mining.<br />
<br />
Exploration<br />
<br />
Needless to say, Ipec's warrior should continue east. It would be useful if someone could post a map of specials and huts in that area; this would aid in planning the warrior's movements. I'm starting to get surprised that we haven't run into an AI civ yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2003, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent post Viking!:goodjob: I hope you accept your nomination for Domestic Advisor.<br />
<br />
I want to play tomorrow. I'm more than happy to go with this plan - particularly the Barbarian plan.<br />
<br />
Any objections?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2003, 10:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't checked Vikings analysis, but I have no reason to doubt it.  I fully agree that keeping LC from losing population is worth spending some money.  Can LC support soon-to-be bribed Archer?  Archer on a hill would (probably) work to defeat barbs before they ever got to a city, but I don't think an archer stands much chance of capturing a two-move barb leader.  Better to put the new archer in a city somewhere to help keep the peace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2003, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion we must incrementally rush buy a diplomat in LC no later than now. <br />
Sadly, no one seemed to take that much of notice when a similar plan was presented above:( ;) <br />
<br />
LC will be able to support archer. I don't think we should dispatch ellie, because if the barb reaches Dou, she can take em, and if the second barb goes towards LC, we'll just kill them with our new archer.<br />
<br />
One risk that might change the whole plan is if the archer moves towards LC and the leader moves two steps to the new closest archer preventing a bribe. In this case it might be good to have some extra defence in LC, and it wouldn't hurt that much to transfer Neu Phalanx to LC hurt for the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just curious, would moving the warrior out of LC as a sacrifice buy us enough time for the elephant to get there in time to kill the archer?

Maybe we do need to bring the pahalanx over just in case, but porbablly not.  The Viking...u da man!  Although i agree with funxus, maybe we whould keep our newly aquired archer in the city.<br />
<br />
Since we havnt ran into ANY A.I. civs yet makes me think that we may be on an island alone...which makes map making (or MPE)  even more important.  The tech will be easier to come by then the wonder.</div></div><hr />

However, in reference to the previous post by Tim, I would be wary of sacrificing the warrior as right now we need all the military we can get.</div></div><hr />

Once this crisis is over, we need plans in place to deal with landing barbs before they appear, not after.  Perhaps our incoming Military Advisor (whomever that will turn out to be) should tackle this as a first priority in the new term.</div></div><hr />
