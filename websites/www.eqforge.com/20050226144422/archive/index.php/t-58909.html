Considering the status of research of the other civilizations, it is IMPERATIVE that I retract my pleas for armor (Hey, I can dream) and deploy in Africa IMMEDIATELY.  <br />
<br />
For the next turn, we should first begin the revolution en route to fundamentalism, and send the first galleon with a load of 3 cavalry and the AT not just to, but AT Ulundi.  We should disembark on the road square directly to the west of the city and take it ASAP.  At the same time (roughly...same turn anyway) our destroyer near Zimbabwe will begin bombardment.  When it is empty, a cavalry can make it there in one turn provided he sticks to the roads.  We should then take Bapedi, as it provides a sort of staging area behind our front lines for the Zulus to sneak in a catapult.  At this point, we should then concentrate on RBing cavalries out of Zimbabwe and Ulundi to complete the sweep.  As we RB those, the second galleon should land with engineers to &quot;backfill&quot; improvements to the land behind our front lines.  Sort of a jump start in getting the captured cities up to par.<br />
<br />
At the same time (1670 or 1680), begin deploying an initial strike force of 2 cavaly, an AT, and a cannon on a collision course with Athens.  On the next turn, they will land on the mined hills square to the west of Athens and begin the attack.  However, as we approach landfall, if there are units in the fortress to the west-northwest of Athens, we must first eliminate it/them to ensure survival of the strike force.  An alternative in this situation is to land in the forest square to the southwest of Athens.  While we fight for Athens, it would make sense to find a way to start sending a galleon full of cavalry or ATs or a combo of the two towards Argos, as it makes the best sense to focus to the eastern half of Hell after it is split.  And as Athens is ours, we should use the same strategy of RBing cavarly out of Athens, and then Argos and etc. to sweep east along the road network.  The exception to the concentration east is Corinth.  We have a destroyer which is able to sneak in from the north and begin bombardment in two turns.  When it is empty, send a cavalry from Athens to take the city.  The western half of Hell can be worried about as we near the end of the conquest of the eastern.  (It may also make sense to sneak in a Marine in Athens and Corinth for defensive purposes, as these cities will take the blows coming from the western half of Hell.)<br />

You have two phone calls to make, Mr. President...:soldier: <br />

With that, I have four words to close...<br />

RIDE TO MEET THEM!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 21, 2003, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we shouldn't revolt until the turn before our forces are about to reach Hell unless the departure of the military forces from our cities causes a revolt that can't be fixed using Elvii. The reason I'd prefer to revolt the turn before we reach Athens is that I think it would be useful for us to be in fundamentalism and not anarchy when we start military operations.<br />
<br />
At the same time we want to attack with a very strong force so I don't think we should revolt until 1-2 turns from now and we should rush buy military stuff in VM and Naer now, these units can then board our galleons next turn.<br />
<br />
I think we should send two galleons to Athens, bribe the archer in the fortress and occupy it (this means we need a diplomat and we have one sleeping near Ipec). On the next turn we can attack Athens. The archer (assuming he will still be in the fortress) is going to be expensive to bribe but I think it is worth it to avoid damaging our unit trying to kill him. The destroyer near Besancon also needs time to reach Athens.<br />
<br />
At the same time we can send the galleon near Igloria to Knossos and use the destroyer in Igloria to pound Knossos. Thus Athens and Knossos would be ours on the same turn (remember to capture Athens first because it has Sun Tzu).<br />
<br />
At the same time (or possibly a turn earlier while still in anarchy) we can start attacking the Zulus. It is extremely important not to attack or get into contact with any Greek or Zulu military units while still a democracy.</div></div><hr />
