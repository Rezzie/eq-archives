<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bachus</div><div class="date">Oct 20, 2004, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I quit playing civ2 GOTM for over an year now, because of the time I used to loose with it. However, I consider myself a civfanatic, because civilization was definitely The Game for me. And then Civ2. Unfortunately, I couldn't spend too much time on it lately and it seems this will not change for a while. But, from time to time, I let myself caught and play some quick games, just to re-enter the spirit I like so much.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I couldn't find a real challenge in deity, but I kept trying :)  usually some OCC especially because it's quick. I tried to figure some greater challenges,  like deity+, barb+, size 1 OCC. On some civfanatics forum I found an idea (the post belonged to starlifter) that I could build only warriors and caravans for the entire game. Actually I think this is interesting and so I might try it some time in the future. An idea I thought of was winning and not having any city.... just with the units found in the huts. This seemed very appealing, but I realized its impossibility... you had to be lucky to find 10 units in huts.. and they were not enough but for 2-3 early cities.<br />
<br />
But I thought Ok, not this, but at least not to have cities on my own.... meaning not founding any cities and not any advanced tribes. I decided to give it a try, especially because I like the initial exploring part... I didn't have anything to loose<br />
<br />
So,  here goes: deity level, large map,  raging hordes,  7 civs, everything else random. I chose Aztecs and I was gifted with a bunch of techs... 6 or 7 ,  something that has never happened to me before... so a very good sign.  Of course, I didn't expect to be right from the first try, because I had tried a few games before in search of a 1 size OCC and I knew you needed luck. What I was searching for was another civ on the same continent with me. What I wanted was to conquer with the units in the huts at least a city from that civ. I knew from my previous exploration games that with no city founded (I was in search for a suitable place for size 1 OCC) mostly out of the huts I got units... this was what I wanted  <br />
<br />
Good, so I started exploring. I don't remember very well, but I think I had 1 or maybe 2 huts very close to my starting point... I got a unit I think... and started exploring....<br />
<br />
I don't have in my mind very clearly all the events... I know that I got many units, 1 science or 2 early, some 50 gold.... and I was exploring. I wasn't using any hut pattern for finding the huts... I told you I didn't want to waste time and afterall it was funnier this way. <br />
<br />
Anyway, at some time I ran into Indians while going West. I exchanged some knowledge and allied. I have to tell you that I was pretty advanced, mostly because of the starting techs, and in the first 2 knowledge huts I found... shocking... Trade and Engineering ...  :)  <br />
<br />
After meeting the Indians I passed their unit while still exploring. I was huntin' huts  :)  That's why I wanted an alliance with them... to avoid ZOC. So, I explored further until I found the edge of the continent and some more huts. Some 25, some unit... same ol' stuff... I think I read in some post some long time ago when all I was doing on the net was civ related something about chances when popping huts... but I forgot it :)  Anyway, I still remember it had something to do with you having or not a city and with the distance to your nearest city (maybe compared to the distance to the next AI city?). But I have to tell you that I had no wandering nomads in this game (and in a few previous with no city founded) and no advanced tribe. Regarding the advanced tribe, i have to tell you I got one in a previous game, I &quot;think&quot; that with no city founded... so I tend to believe this is possible. <br />
<br />
Coming back to the game... I moved my legions into position to Delhi, intending to take it. In the meantime, I have met the Zulus and allied with them. So, I tried to move slowly ALL of my East units towards Zimbabwe and all of my West units for Delhi. In the meantime, I cancelled the alliance with the Indians intending to establish some ZOC,  for I hadn't seen any other city besides Delhi and I wanted to destroy them if possible. And I wanted to deny them resources, so I fortified on a mine near their city<br />
<br />
The good thing about not having a city is that you  can withdraw you units to your nearest city and not care :) So I stayed there on the hill until all the units arrived.<br />
<br />
In the meantime,  I had all my units near Zimbabwe and cancelled the alliance with the Zulus. The 2 settlers were also here, I had Construction, so I had time to build a fortress near the city. When my last units arrived,  I attacked having 2 legions, 1 archer and 1 horsemen. Their 1 phalanx died at the first legion... so I had a city... 850 B.C. !   :band: <br />
<br />
The problem was that now when I was asked to withdraw troops from Delhi... I was trapped :)  So I declared war on the Indians and attacked having 1 legion and 2 horsemen. Legion dies, horsemen dies, horsemen wins. Next turn, I took 1 size empty Delhi :sad:  they had a phalanx nearby... I didn't want to wait... maybe I rushed a little but I thought I would destroy them... it wasn't the case... they must have slipped a settler.... Anyway, the West front was soon over... My remaining horsemen won 2 battles, went in the mountains to heal  :) , returned after, hit a settler and was killed by an archer :( <br />
<br />
So, all the hopes on the East front... the Zulus had only one more city, Ulundi...<br />
<br />
Here is attached my first save, 3050 B.C. and a save at 850 B.C., having a city<br />
<br />
.... more to follow ... hopefully I will catch up  with my current game status...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bachus</div><div class="date">Oct 21, 2004, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess I gave the remaining civs quite an advantage, I mean I had my own city only at 850 B.C, a size 2 city, with no improvements. But I didn't feel bad, because I knew the Indians were not far ahead, and the Zulus too. And I heard that the English had been destroyed by barbarians....<br />
<br />
My next priority was to take Ulundi. I had now a veteran Legion, so I had chances. But they had City Walls, so....  :(  ... I decided to wait until Mathemathics. In the meantime, I fortified at 2 spaces from their city in a fortress on some forest and I sent my horsemen south to catch any settler trying to escape the siege. That's how I found their other city, Bapedi. I sent the veteran Legion there, with the Horsemen. First attack with the legion, warrior dies. I took again the empty size 1 city.... probably a mistake now that I reconsider the situation... it could have been another city... but I didn't have patience to let it grow.... like I said, probably a mistake.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was let now for sure with only one Zulus city and this one I was going to have, as it had City Walls. But in the meantime, my situation was not very good... my Zimbabwe was not of much help. I rushed in it the Palace with the money from the huts and from the tribute collected so far. Then I produced 2 Phalanx to keep a size 3 city content having 5 production from switching the population on some trees. Then I probably made another wrong estimation... I made a Dye Caravan for trading Ulundi... I thought it might help me in research and it would also be an early trade route... I was researching Polytheism I think.... but it brought me only some 30 gold... not too much<br />
<br />
The next building I decided to be a Wonder, for I didn't need any units. My settlers were improving terrain near my city... I decided to come even closer to the Zulus city, they had a road between the 2 cities, so I &quot;trained&quot; one Settler irrigating a forest for a few turns then I relocated it on a road grassland near Ulundi and built the same turn a fortress.... :)  I moved my legions there and fortified them. After that, I even changed that square to forest to be more secure. Now the Zulus were really trapped and I didn't make peace with them, just some cease - fire in the hope of getting some tribute.<br />
<br />
Coming back to the Wonder, I didn't hesitate much. There were some 6 available, no Literacy yet, I thought a little at Collossus, a little less at Hanging Gardens, but my first choice was Marco Polo all the time. So I went for Marco, which I built with some money around 250 A.D, receiving 100 from the Indians who must have feared me badly, even if I didn't have any hope of contacting them again too soon. So, I built Marco Polo and I started trading techs. I found out that I was quite advanced, so I got all the techs from the other civs and allied with the Russians. In the acquired techs were Monarchy and Mathemathics and I switched from Despotism immediately, not caring of Oedo years... I had to give up my research efforts, as now I could do research at an incredible pace of 80 turns and I was merely half done with the current science. But I was relaxed, as I had Marco Polo now.<br />
<br />
I took a look at my opponents. Quite warmongering. Russians, Germans, Greeks replacing English and Persans were the unknown civs. I managed to exchange maps with Germans only and they had a nice island. I wasn't really worried, just expected the Russians to take over some good part of the world later.<br />
<br />
Having Mathemathics, I came back to my city and rushed Temple, Barracks, then IRB 2 catapults. The Zulus were doomed....  :) <br />

Enjoy your games!<br />
