<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2002, 05:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know fellas, this thing is going nuts on me. I started noticing little nuisance problems about three days ago with my computer. Like when I'd be in Internet Explorer and pull down the address bar, IE would freeze up and I'd have to use ctrl-alt-del. About a day after, when I'd use Windows Media Player to watch a movie or something and I'd go to open the file, freeze up. Just stupid little annoying things like that. But now...<br />
<br />
About six hours ago, I decided I'd try out FlashFXP (tired of Cute FTP). I got it installed but when I go to open it up I get this error:<br />
<br />
FLASHFXP caused an invalid page fault in<br />

<br />
When I run the Debug option on the window I get a blue screen with:<br />
<br />
Invalid VxD dynamic link call from VWIN32 (05) + 0000119E to device &quot;0002,&quot; service 1.<br />
Your Windows configuration is invalid. Run the Windows setup program to correct this problem.<br />
<br />
OK, getting wierder. I try reinstalling, restarting, you know, nothing major but still get the same error message. I figure I'll reinstall windows (98se) so I spend an hour doing that, still the same problem. I try some other programs on my system to see if they get the same thing. Of the ones I've checked, only WinAce does the same thing. Meanwhile, programs (namely my games) on my other harddrive won't boot -you know, you run them, and nothing happens.<br />
<br />
I know direct connect works, along with Internet Explorer (with the nuisance bugs), Windows Explorer, Outlook Express, Opera, MS Office, WS_FTP, WinRAR, and a bunch of others. But when it comes to those two programs (WinAce and FlashFXP, I get that error above).<br />
<br />
I've used Norton Antivirus to check for viruses and found nothing. I've used trojan remover to hunt down trojans...again, nothing. I've run Scan disk for errors...nothing. I haven't touched the registry; in fact, I the only thing that I've changed since my last reformat was a new video card.  Does anyone out there have an ace up their sleeve for me? I'd like to get this problem fixed and about the only thing more I know to do is re-format the drive.<br />
<br />
Here's the computer stats:<br />
<br />
Intel Pentium III 733 MHz <br />
ASUS P3V-4x Motherboard / ATA-66 / 133MHz bus (BIOS version 8 I believe)<br />
256 MB SDRAM<br />
One 10 GB Western Digital hard drive (this being the drive with windows on it)<br />
One 80 GB Maxtor hard drive</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2002, 06:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a video problem, and is related to one or more of:  driver, hardware, AGP bus, and/or north/south bridge driver.<br />
<br />
The jibberish in the two errors says a lot, when taken together.  It was extremely helpful to have included that!<br />
<br />
Can you tell me:<br />
<br />
1. The exact Video card you are using .<br />
2. Have you flashed the BIOS on the video card (if you don't know what I'm asking, then you haven't).<br />
3.  At boot time, before any Windoze begins, the very first thing on your blank video screen should give the name and revision and BIOS number of your video card... you may hve to bood a few times to catch it all.<br />
4.  Have you installed any video driver from your video card mfgr?<br />
5.  Do you have a Reference Driver for the video card?  (if you don't know what a Reference Driver is, let me know &amp; I'll explain)<br />
<br />
<br />
6. What happens if you run Win98 in the safe mode, &amp; do all (or all you can) of the same actions that cause errors?<br />
<br />
7.  What is the exact windoze version:<br />
<br />
Start--&gt;ControlPanel---&gt;System---&gt;General Tab<br />
<br />
8. What does Windoze report as your video driver:<br />
<br />
Start--&gt;CP--&gt;System--&gt;Device Manager Tab--&gt;Display Adapter--&gt;Double Click on you Video Card name ---&gt;Driver--&gt;Driver File Details<br />
<br />
(State all that it says, or give a screenshot)<br />
<br />
9.  What happens if you do:<br />
<br />
Start --&gt; Run --&gt;  Qfecheck.exe  [ENTER]<br />
<br />
(This runs an MS diagnostic called Qfecheck.exe, but  only certain patches may have installed it, so nothing may happen, e.g., program not found)<br />
<br />
<br />
10.  Do not reformat your hard drive.  It is not a problem with your HD.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is very likely solvable, just need more info first.  Video is a psin.  Most likely, you will download a new video driver, but it may need to be a Reference Driver, not the Card Maker's to run best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2002, 06:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PS, it is not a virus problem, and not a boot sector problem.  We're going to either finger Microsoft or the Video Card maker or the Video Chip driver programmers with the above info.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, have you ever installed a busmaster driver (if you don't know what it is, then don't worry)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2002, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm...Video problems?  I hadn't thoguht of that (I thought it was a registry mangle-up) but now that you mention I just noticed that my display went from true color (32 bit) to high color (16 bit).  For the questions:<br />
<br />
1.  Visiontek Xtasy GeForce 4 MX 440 64 MB DDR Memory<br />
<br />
2.  No, the BIOS itself has not been altered.<br />
<br />
3.  All I've been able to pick up is BIOS v 6.0<br />
<br />
4.  The only video drivers installed were the ones that came with new card.<br />
<br />
5.  Stumped on this one, don't know what a reference driver is so...<br />
<br />
6.  Well I'll be a monkey's bare assed uncle.  In safe mode I can get all the bum programs working again...FlashFXP, WinAce, GTA3.<br />
<br />
7.  Microsoft Windows 98se 4.10.2222 A<br />

8.  Tried to just get a screenshot, but the computer chugs like a little b**** when I try to use the civfan upload feature and never gets around to uploading.  Here's a written version:<br />

--C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\NVMINI.VXD (just noticed extension VXD...as mentioned in the bluescreen)<br />
----C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\vmm.vxd (vdd.vxd)<br />
<br />
Provider:  NVIDIA Corporation<br />
File Version:  4.13.01.2730<br />
<br />
9.  Program is not installed on my box<br />
<br />
10.  Aint never installed, much less know what a busmaster driver is.<br />
<br />
Background info on the card:  About three weeks ago I aquired Grand Theft Auto 3 for PC only to find that the card that came with my computer (a Guillemot Cougar Maxi Gamer 32 MB TNT2) had an unplayable framerate.  I dug into my pockets to buy a new card and got this one at a nice price.  Installation went smooth and easy and no problems were apparent.  It's only been in the last three days or so that I've been having problems with my computer.  <br />
<br />
I have to admit, I'm going to be a little pissed if all I needed was a new driver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2002, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm going to be a little pissed if all I needed was a new driver. <br />
It's looking like you can start being pissed then ;)<br />
<br />
http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?PAGE=windows9x<br />
<br />
Version: 29.42<br />
File Size: 8.0 MB<br />
Release Date: June 11, 2002<br />
<br />
Use this page, and download the Win98 reference driver from nVidia.<br />
<br />
There are 3 &quot;kinds&quot; of drivers... the default MS OS drivers (very limited use of new cards with 98), the Manufacturer's drivers (who made you video card; check their website), and th Reference Drivers.<br />
<br />
nVidia makes the Ref Drv for your card.  These drivers fully support the chip (GEForce, in this case)... but will not include most &quot;goodies&quot; that some card makers throw in, like TC out on some ASUS cards.<br />
<br />
Mfgrs. always begin with Ref drvrs, and their sweat shop programmers hack and change the Ref Drv, and hope it works.  nVidia is always several steps ahead of Mfg because of the time delay.<br />
<br />
Sooooo.... just use the RefDrivers, and skip any fancy smancy stuff for now.<br />
<br />
Follow the instructions on install carefully.... don't shortcut steps.<br />
<br />
If you get in deep doo doo, just reboot into safe mode and continue, or start again.<br />
<br />
When the new drivers are installed, hopefully the conflicts will be resolved.  If not, you may have to wait for a new revision.  E-mail nVidia with exact details, just like here, and they will start an internal tracking of our issue.... no timetable on when/if they will fix the conflict in a new version, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sooo... try installing the nVidia ref dirvers (&quot;DetonatorXP&quot; 29.42).<br />
<br />
<br />
If you choose, you can use a 28.xx version from visiontek:<br />
<br />
http://www.visiontek.com/OTHER/detonator4.shtml<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OR..... you can download them both, and see which one you like best....  If the newest visiontek works fine, then stick with it.  If not, use the Ref Driver rom nVidia.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS, you are currently using version 27.30.....<br />
<br />
PS #2:  Don't flash your Motherboard BIOS unless you have a specific reason to (like a bug that will fix a problem, according to their website).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2002, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've installed new drivers from both NVIDIA and Visiontek, but no luck at all.  I still get the same error mentioned above when I try to run either FlashFXP or WinAce.  Meanwhile, programs on the other drive still won't boot at all, or just freeze the b****.  Any more aces up your sleeve?  (If i can't get this fixed by tomorrow, I'm going to do the three Rs.  And if it still doesn't work, I'm gonna take it to my boys at  TAC (http://www.totallyawesome.com))<br />
<br />
In any case, thanks for all the help you've given me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2002, 11:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm.... this is just an interim update, as I'm doing several things in real life and finishing a succession post, but I've now searched about a dozen tech sites, and discovered there haev been over two dozen posts, internet wide, on this issue since 1998.  Only win98 or 98SE is ever mentioned in regard to this error, and I have my suspicions, but have no proof yet.<br />
<br />
No one anywhere has ever posted a solution to this.  Either no one has solved it, or no one has posted what they did to overcome it.  One post found it went away after one of his re-installations, but had no idea why because it had consistently failed before.<br />
<br />
I will get back later tonight, and post more.  I don't like not knowing something like this that I probably should be able to figure out by this point.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I gave my win98 away a long time ago, and cannot check the registry structure for some things.<br />
<br />
So I have to think some more, so don't waste time doing stuff to fix it yourself yet.<br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
<br />
1.  Are you able to edit the Registry with confidence?  LOL, do you know what the registry is (many don't, BTW)?<br />
<br />
2.  Do you have any Utilities, esp. Norton Utilities?<br />
<br />
If so, I would want you to use it's Registry Editor.  If not, we might can make do with the MS editor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, You don't have a hardware problem, at least in terms of defective hardware.  This is an MS issue (what's new :(  )... one of tens of thousands, and why they should only be allowed to market their OSs as &quot;Experimental:  Beta&quot;  heeheh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2002, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is an MS program that will check the status of MS updates, including the ones that MS included in your OS's particualr build.<br />
<br />
Just unzip it into the c:\windows (or wherever you installed Win98) directory.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Run it either by making a shortcut to it, or by Start--&gt;Run---&gt;qfecheck.exe<br />
<br />
A window will pop up, and if you see any stuff set off by red or yellow symbols, let me know what they are.<br />
<br />
A Screenshot would be nice, if your SS program will work.  If not, just tell me anything that looks like an error.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2002, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some general thought about your error, since neither MS nor Tech sites have published a cure for this.<br />
<br />
You hav an Invalid Page Fault.<br />
<br />
An invalid page fault may occur when parameters are passed between programs and the Windows operating  system.  An invalid parameter may cause a program to run invalid instructions, which page fault.  Invalid instruction can occur in any of the following situations: <br />
<br />
1. If the virtual memory becomes unstable due to a shortage of physical memory (RAM) <br />
2. If the virtual memory becomes unstable due to a shortage of free disk space <br />
3.  If the virtual memory area is damaged by a program <br />
4. If a program attempts to access data that is being modified by another running program <br />
<br />
Some possibilities, but less probably than what you've already done (that didn'tcure it):<br />
<br />
1.  Disk disk-related.<br />
2.  RAM-Related.<br />
3.  3rd party program behaving badly.<br />
<br />
I really hesitate to recommend how to check the RAM, as I don't know how good you are at stuff inside you box, and if you're not, you may physically damage the RAM.  But I have cured RAM related problems before by re-seating the RAM modules, which scrubs accumulated varnish off the contacts.  Don't try this, however, because I really think it is a MS/WIn98 issue.<br />
<br />
As far as the disk goes, I presume you are running FAT32 on all your physical drives, and have at least about 10% free disk space on the C:\.  If so, there is a remote possibility that reformatting (or just using a really good disk repair utility) might work, if Win98 has introduced certain rare inconsistencies to your HD.... this will cause the Swap File to be read incorrectly, and could concievably generate the unknown module error.<br />
<br />
<br />
The strange thing is the unknown module part.  There is a Win98 issue preventing boot after install that will cause the VWIN32 (05) part, but not the specifcs of teh rest.  And Win98 boot, plus runs right in safe mode... which means there is either a 3rd party confilict, RAM issue, or maybe a Swap File problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I would not worry about your Video Card or Video driver now.  you needed to upgrade teh driver anyway.<br />
<br />
Once we find out if there is a program conflict, you'll likely need to just format the hard Drive and re-install, but don't jump to that yet (you'd use safe mode to back up data first, of course).<br />
<br />
I'll check back  here tomorrow &amp; see what you've replied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2002, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, whatever it was, I fixed the motherf****er.  All it took was as reformat.  Now I've got clean hard-drive, a clean registry, and a fresh system.  FlashFXP is working, so is WinAce, and the files on my other hard drive are still intact.<br />
<br />
I'm inclined to believe it was a corrupt dynamic link library or maybe a bunch that were put on the harddrive either by windows or by another program.  It wouldn't be the first time it's happened either.  Just last January when I was getting cable internet installed, the installation guy spent two days trying to get the thing to work just because of a corrupt winsock file.  <br />
<br />
...Windows...:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Well, thanks again, starlifter.  Maybe next time I have a computer problem it won't be unfixable.</div></div><hr />

It wouldn't be the first time it's happened either.  <br />
<br />
There are several very technical and subtle things that can be done to the underlying file structure on a HD.... as small as a single bit in the partition structure.  It is like the framework that holds up a building.  Very few people are able to spot these things using a hex editor, and changing bits manually... (it takes me a very long time to do it, esp. now that I rarely have had to try it in the last few years).<br />
<br />
The easiest thing, by far, is just to format.    Evidently, that is where this issue actually resided, and likely affected why the &quot;unknown module&quot;  was fingered.... <br />
<br />
Glad it's fixed... you needed your driver updates anyway, so all was not for nought.  Which one did you choose to use, BTW?  The nVidia or the Mfgr's?  <br />
<br />
Personally, I've long since started using nVidia's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2002, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just installed the NVIDIA drivers.  Why get your junk from the middle man when you can just get it from the manufacturer?  <br />
<br />
Oh, and I'd just like to take this moment to say Windows is a whiney little b****!  It took me longer to configure DHCP than all the time I spent formatting and reinstalling.  I actually had this problem fixed last night, but couldn't get on the net to say so till a few hours ago.</div></div><hr />

You also won't face the phone calls to MS to beg for permission to reinstall your OS when you cahnge hardware, particularly your network card.  :)</div></div><hr />
