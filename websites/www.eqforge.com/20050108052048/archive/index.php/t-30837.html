Now, the &quot;To&quot; line of the address is =)-, but seeing as it went straight to junk-mail, it must have been sent to 100's of people.  It appears to be a scam / spam, but I can't think of any real purpose for it.  The only thing I can think of is that it is a computer generated message, sent to millions of e-mail addresses.  The ones that reply will be added to a list, and the list sold-on as &quot;real&quot; addresses, that respond to spam.<br />
<br />
Any other takes on this?</div></div><hr />

I'm sure it's in my Hotmail box right now (where I send all my spam mail).  Usually when you reply, your email is put on the active list.  <br />
<br />
Believe me, once your on the list, your never getting off.</div></div><hr />

Some guy was going on about this same thing at...some other board I know.  Take the IP from the email header and probe their system.  &quot;If they were dumb enough to reply, their probably dumb enough not to have good protection.&quot;</div></div><hr />
