Based on this poll (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=55172) :<br />
<br />
If Monarchy is selected by the people, set the science queue to Polytheism-&gt;Monarchy.  This can be done before or after the Lit trades since none of them affect this path.<br />
<br />
If Republic is chosen, perform any of the Lit + Gold for tech deals in this discussion (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=55134) that might be approved, and then select Republic on the tech tree which will set the queue to include anything we didn't trade for.  (This is most likely to be just Republic, since the trade idea has widespread support).<br />
<br />
I haven't planned this as well as it could be as there is no time for a followup poll on what to do if &quot;don't use government&quot; were to win, but I'll interpret that to mean the people want to follow the other open path, which would be Map Making-&gt;Math-&gt;Currency or Math-&gt;Currency.  If necessary please do a snap poll on whether to start with Math or Map Making.<br />
<br />
I will be gone from 6/7 thru 6/16.  It looks like we are unlikely to get beyond this part of the queue unless Domestic supports going max research.  Just in case I'll post a poll on the remaining required techs, follow that poll in future turns if needed.<br />
<br />
Good luck with the war!</div></div><hr />

Better late then never.<br />
FA Instructions: <br />
Based on the Lit Poll (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=55240), do the trades. (Do it preturn. We dont want Abe siding with Cleo)<br />
According to This Military Poll (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=55238), we are going for a Cleo Slaughter, so the phrase &quot;Check for Peace&quot; is out of the question.<br />
I can't find any Military Aliances w/ Alex that wont cost us all of our gold And since I never polled it...., I guess thats out of the question. Remember to do the GPT Deals!<br />
Also, out of my field (Domestic), but according to This (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=55238), we are building the Great Library in Gorina (current time 67 turns, but that may go down to 40something with the GA). Also, Im neither the mayor nor the governor here, but I would recomend some irrigation in Gorina.<br />
<br />
(PS- I got the role I wanted. I am Lucentio, a Man of Pisa. I come to Penguinadua in persuit of knowledge, art and Bianca)</div></div><hr />

Turn 1 (www.civfanatics.net/uploads4/DG3_BC330.zip)<br />
<br />
We are advancing our troops on Egypt, but they apparently have Iron(we saw their first Swordsman).  This may be more of a battle than we expected, as we have already lost two Legions to Cleo's troops.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Turn 2 (http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads4/DG3_BC310.zip)<br />
<br />
We have reached a point where our Military necessity may exceed our income, so I saved the game here.  We are currently at 146g(22gpt) but we have 2 more warriors ready to join the cause.<br />
<br />
Right now we have 5 Legions 2 tiles away from Byblos.</div></div><hr />
