World War Two: Revived<br />
<br />
First, no, this is not a continuation of my last game. Instead, I have drafted new rules. However, I am using the same map, just I redrew it on a larger Europe (thanks to plexus) so the borders are a bit larger. <br />
<br />
The rules will have a hint of neo NES type rules, so pay attention (thanks to stalin for the neo nes series). <br />
<br />
It will be a bit like board, but mostly story. <br />
<br />
RULES<br />
<br />
Economy<br />
Economy will be done in terms of credits. Each province you own gives you 5 credits, and each additional city you own gives you 5 credits. So the province of London makes Britain 10c per turn (5c from town, 5c from the province). You can then use your economy to construct military units. There is no way to improve your economy but annexing new territory – you can not build new cities or anything like that. And no banking from one turn to the next. <br />
<br />
Military<br />
This is where a bit of neo NES comes in. Your military will be broken into armies, fleets, and squadrons. They will then be broken down into separate units, but they must all stick together in the army/fleet/squadron, and is shown on map by the corresponding number in your template. I will explain army first. An “army” can comprise of various units found at the bottom of this post (may be in second post) which has a price list as well. For example Germany wants to make their Afrika Korps comprise of 3 artillery batteries, 4 infantry regiments, and 4 tank brigades. That would be fine. You can have as many different kinds, and as many units in one army as you want. But remember, they must stick together in army, you cant have part of the Afrika Korps in Germany and part in Africa. Same goes with fleets and squadrons, with their corresponding units. <br />
<br />
You may research upgrades to units. This will be kept track of on your template under the technology stat. Once tech is finished research, it automatically upgrades your whole army/navy/air force with it. The cost is free, the time it will take is based upon the country you are, and what is happening in the world.  <br />
<br />
The specialty training of your troops in the army can be different as well. Again, like neo nes, you may have training in desert, grasslands, snow and mountains. Only one training specialty per army, except for one army, that may have training in all 4. Regular training increases like the following and can be done in all military: Militia-Poor-Trained-Well Trained-Veteran-Expeditionary-Elite. All start with trained unless specified. You may only reach Expeditionary or Veterans levels when you have combat experience and are trained in at least one specialty terrain. Training also takes the amount of turns as the number of regiments divided by two (rounded up) there are in the army, how many ships there are in navy, and different planes in squadrons divided by two. Training for all is army-wide, you cant have specialty for each regiment in army. To get a lower training (all units produced after first turn are 'Tained' status), basically it depends on how large your army is. If you have a very large army, then when you make a new army, their training goes down. Also, if you are not active enough, training may go down. Training costs 30c. <br />
<br />
Movement<br />
Is to the slowest unit in a army/navy/squadron. Movement is shown on unit descriptions. When it comes to loading/unloading. You may load onto a transport, transport can move to another sea, but cannot unload. It cannot unload regardless if it moves or not. You can unload and load another army though, on same turn. <br />
<br />
*Naval units can only be created from a province that has a city and is next to a sea. If a province with a city is next to two or more seas, they may pick what they build in. <br />
<br />
*You can invade neutral countries, though it will be a hard fight just like any other country, and may risk other neutral countries joining in an alliance with your enemies. <br />
<br />
*Weather will affect your troops. <br />
<br />
*Moral at home country will hurt your production if it gets to low. To raise it, try winning some battles J. <br />
<br />
*If a city is bombed enough (and I mean a lot a lot, at least a years, and I’m not promising anything, could be before or after), it can be wiped from the map and loose production from it. It cannot be rebuilt. <br />
<br />
*Air craft must land in air field, carrier, or city within 3 provinces in one turn. The province they leave does not count. For example, if germany had a field in Pru, a squadron can take off from Rhi, fly to Ham, Ber, and then land in Pru. So its really that you can move 3 times, instead of three countries. You can only attack once if your bombing during that time. <br />
<br />
*You can only attack once per army/navy/squadron, but can defend innumerable times.<br />
<br />
*First turn you get a sum of money to spend on each of your armed forces individually. You may not use money from army sum to pay for stuff in your navy.   <br />
<br />
First amount is army, second is air force, third is navy.<br />

<br />
Army<br />
Infantry Regiment: Is the basic unit of the army. Includes the infantry who generally walk or ride in unprotected trucks to targets. They carry machine guns and rifles, flame throwers and small explosives. Can move one province per turn. 3c<br />
<br />
Mechanized Infantry Regiment: An infantry that ride in heavily armored trucks and vehicles, great for supporting the infantry. Can move two provinces per turn. 5c<br />
<br />
Armor Brigade: Contains tanks and support vehicles. Great against enemy tanks, and against infantry when coupled with infantry or mechanized infantry. Can move two provinces per turn. 7c<br />
<br />
Artillery Battery: Contains heavy artillery for bombarding and support attacking ground forces. Can move one province per turn. 7c. <br />
<br />
Anti Aircraft Batter: Basically is artillery aimed at the sky J. Great for protecting your armor and artillery batteries, though susceptible to attack. 5c. <br />
<br />
Paratroopers: Can be dropped from troop transport planes. They are as good as regular infantry regiment. Once dropped, they must wait until next turn before they can move a province. After that, they an move one province per turn. 5c. <br />
<br />
Marines: Are specially good at amphibious landings, but begin to become just as good as regular infantry regiments as they increase into land. One province per turn. 5c. <br />
<br />
Navy<br />
Air Craft Carrier: Contains room for five fighter/bomber air craft squadrons, and on top of that five troop transport squadrons. Very good offense, but bad defense. One sea per turn. 45c. <br />
<br />
Battleship: Is the pride of most navies, and is the most powerful single unit ship out there. It has good defense and offense against navies, but a huge target for air forces and can move one sea per turn. 35c. <br />
<br />
Destroyer: Great for guarding the battleships and fleet, and quite the little fighter as well. Good anti-aircraft defense. One sea per turn. 20c. <br />
<br />
Frigate: Great for hunting and defending from enemy subs and air craft, but is weak to naval attacks. One sea per turn. 15c. <br />
<br />
Submarine: Good offensive unit, not so good for defense. One sea per turn. 15c. <br />
<br />
Transport: Can transport one army. No defenses or offense gunnery. One sea per turn. 15c. <br />
<br />
Air Force (all air force can move three provinces a turn. HAVE to land in a city or air field).<br />
Fighter/Bomber: This is a small fighter that can carry a couple torpedoes if it is on a carrier, or a small payload of bombs to attack land targets. It is moderate in all attack, sea, air and land. 7c.<br />
<br />
Fighter: Great against enemy air craft, but can’t attack navy or ground targets very well. 5c. <br />
<br />
Bombers: Can bomb the living daylights out of a army or city. They are weak against enemy fighters though. 7c. <br />
<br />
Troop Transports: Can only drop parashooters. Has no defense whatsoever. 5c.</div></div><hr />

We do not wish for war and we thank you for your proposal. We accept the terms and as for the moment have no wish for action against any nation. We would also like to extend our hand further and bridge the harsh gap that was left after the butchery on Flanders and other fields of the Great War. We do not want this ever again. Therefore we propose an non agression pact between our peoples.</div></div><hr />

Peace in our time<br />
<br />
Minister Chamberlaine flew back from Munich today after signing a new agreement with Chancellor Hitler. Despite worries of war in the future, the most dreaded of things that it is the Prime minister seems to have handed a peace time olive branch to the peoples of Germany. The nation waits with baited breath as to what the old enemy has to say.<br />
<br />
Re-armament!<br />
<br />
The majestic arms of the armed forces today announced plans to re-arm and recover from the Great war once and for all. With the pride of the nation the Royal navy who has defended our island for centuries leading the way. The HMS Hood was launched today in London, whilst in neighbouring ship yards Aircraft carriers, battleships and frigates also rolled off the line.<br />
       The army and royal airforce also expanded their forces with new aircraft and tanks being designed and roling off construction lines around the country.<br />

<br />
Yeah, good point about the militia, lol. I will answer it in the following post. <br />
<br />
You pay 30c and it trains every unit in your army, since the training goes for all army. But remember it takes time. You can not fight with an army while training it.. If you were Russia, you could do that. <br />
<br />
Sgt, Cyrpus doesn't count as a province. But you can put your troops on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jason The King</div><div class="date">Dec 13, 2003, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To get a lower training (all units produced after first turn are 'Tained' status), basically it depends on how large your army is. If you have a very large army, then when you make a new army, their training goes down. Also, if you are not active enough, training may go down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Korean Tribune<br />
<br />
European Tensions Escalate<br />
As the super powers of the world begin to mobilize, their neighbors do so as well. Millions of dollars have been spent by each country to begin the construction and mobilization of resources to better meet their neighbors. It is evident that something will happen. <br />
<br />
Romania Invades Hungary!<br />
A daring attempt to increase the capacity of the small country, the Romanian government has issued a full assault upon the nation of Hungary in an attempt to secure more industry and resources. The fighting rages on through the month as the Romanians fight within the foothills of the country. The President of Romania rages on that he must get the air force in on the fight, but the Admiral assures him that the air force can not travel that far. The 1st Armor Division is also forced to serve as back up next month, as it used this month to travel to [Tra]. So far, the Hungarians have put up a huge fight, killing many Romanian men, 2 infantry regiments from 1st Infantry Division and a regiment from the 2nd Infantry divisions have been wiped out. <br />
<br />
Spain Declares War on Portugal<br />
With the Declaration of War just a day before the initial invasion, the Spanish take the Portuguese by surprise. At the battle of Guadiana river, the Spanish loose the many men from the 1st Infantry Division, destroying nearly three infantry regiments. However, the Portuguese were pushed back and the river was secured for Spain. <br />
<br />
---Spanish Atlantic Armada meets with Portuguese Defense Fleet<br />
A battle that would decide the fate of the seas around Portugal, the Portuguese fleet left port from Lisbon and Oporto to meet the Spanish fleet in the North. In the Battle of Mid-Atlantic, the Spanish Armada initially destroyed the two frigates of the Portuguese navy, and damages the destroyer with almost no losses to itself. Limping back to Lisbon, the destroyer is met up with the only battleship, and last undamaged ship of the Portuguese navy, and they both dock at Lisbon. <br />
<br />
---The Skies of Spain Belong to Spain<br />
After a dogfight in the skies above Madrid, the once-superior Portuguese Air Force was forced to retreat to defend the skies of Lisbon. Only a few blocks of Madrid were affected, and moral was greatly raised by the victorious Spanish fighters that eliminated the threat from the Spanish people. <br />
<br />
Turkish Troops Cross into Bulgaria!<br />
Following a surprise declaration of war, the Turkish troops smashed into Bulgarian border guards. While winning the initial battles, Bulgarian troops begin to mass near the capital and the fighting gets hard. The Turkish Home Guard, the army sent to attack Bulgaria, starts to get held up near the capital and a bloody stalemate ensues. Three mechanized infantry regiments were destroyed while trying to regroup near Burgas, after an ambush of the Bulgarian air and ground forces. The skies, despite the attempts from the Con Air Attack Group, still belong to Bulgaria. <br />
<br />
German War Machine Awakens<br />
With the massive re-armament of the German army and air force, the chancellor has unleashed a fury upon Austria, capturing Vienna with little casualties with support of the 3rd Squadron. The 1st Army has managed to capture Vienna quite easily, but holding it is what destroys nearly three infantry regiments. The skies are empty after the German raid from the 3rd Squadron, they left and returned to Germany, leaving the Austrians the skies. However, the Austrian air force contains no better then scout air craft, and so is not a problem to the invading Germans. <br />

Italy to invade Yugoslavia!<br />
A quick and seemingly surprised move, the Italian government has ordered a full strike upon Yugoslavia “for the defense of the smaller Balkan countries, such as Albania.” As of now, the Italian 1st Army has met with a huge resistance in the mountaineous terrain, fighting against the Yugoslavian Croatian Defense Force. Having complete and utter air superiority, the Italians are able to advance through the harsh terrain and gain against the unprepared Yugoslavian force. However, the Yugoslavians have been able to mount a successfully harmful defense force against the 1st Army, destroying two infantry regiments and an armor brigade near the town of Zagreb. Meanwhile the Yugoslavian and Italian navies have yet to clash in the Adriatic Sea. <br />

<br />
In a daring move, paired with their full invasion force in the north, the Italian 4th Para dropped into Sarajevo, the center of much of the regional trade and industry, and has managed to capture the city, only fighting local militia and townspeople. Four Italian soldiers have been lost thus far in this drop. <br />

After a well-thought out idea, the Swedish government initiated the deployment of the 4th Amphibious Assault Force to take over the Icelandic people and secure the limited resources located on that island. The marines of the 4th Assault Force felt little resistance as a beach was secured and the rest of the infantry were unloaded. Advancing closer to the more populated western coast is where resistance from the people took place, with a militia that was able to destroy a mechanized infantry regiment by surprising it from behind. <br />
<br />
Budapest Surrounded, Romanian Victory Near<br />
<br />
http://www.graham.day.dsl.pipex.com/ww2-pic-050.jpg<br />
<br />
Finally implementing the air force, the Romanians are able to rapidly advance through the Hungarian defensive armies. Swinging south, and then to the west, the 1st Armor Division is able to wipe out all contact of Hungary to Yugoslavia, and practically surround Budapest. This was not without a cost though. Nearing Lake Balaton, the largest battle of the war was fought, a tank-versus-tank battle. Having technological and numerical superiority, the Romanians won the battle, which was the most decisive battle yet. One armor division was destroyed, along with a mechanized infantry support regiment. The skies, after a small dogfight where a wing of fighter/bombers were shot down, belong to Romania. <br />
<br />
Western Austria Falls<br />
The German war machine continues to move, taking all of western Austria and the Bavarian Alps. The 3rd Squadron continues to wreak havoc on all of the Austrian military installments, and the German 5th Korps has finally arrived to aid the 2nd. It is rough for the Austrians, but they are able to put up some opposition that seems to drain the German lines. Near the town of Innsbruk, a ferocious battle wages with only half the amount of Germans as there are Austrians. Through the superiority of the German military are they able to win the battle. Four infantry regiments of the Germans are captured, and presumably dead. <br />
<br />
Lisbon Captured!<br />
Following a large offensive initiated by the 1st Armor Division, the Spanish army continued to advance closer and closer to Lisbon until a Portuguese army stopped them. A large battle ensued where many Spanish casualties (3 mechanized regiments and 2 armored) met with a loss for the Spanish army. Then the 2nd Infantry Division came as reinforcements to the 1st Armored Division and together they were able to break the line and capture the beautiful city of Lisbon. The rest of the country lie unoccupied, and already rumors of the leftover Portuguese army training the Portuguese farmers and merchants how to fight has reached the ears of the Spanish government. <br />
<br />
---Skies of Portugal, Spanish<br />
Following the Battle of Lisbon, the Portuguese air force, which was badly reduced in the Battle of Madrid, was finally destroyed after the deployment of Madrid Air Corps. The two fighter squadrons left of Portugal promptly took out two Spanish fighter squadrons before they themselves were shot down. <br />
<br />
Turkish Armies Advance, Bulgaria<br />
With help from the Con Air Attack group, and reinforcements from Turkey, the Turkish Home Guard has been able to advance into the lands of Bulgaria, capturing key towns such as Burgas, Shumen and the capital, Sofia. It has been a hard war so far, and this month was nothing different. The infantry of the Home Guard took the most casualties. For the Battle for Silven, two infantry regiments met their fate, and then another infantry regiment was destroyed near the town of Pernik, doing reconnaissance missions. Many believe the Bulgarian army has not yet fully engaged the Turkish force, and some say they are waiting until a perfect time. <br />
<br />
---Denzili Captured!<br />
Following the continuing invasion of their homeland, the Bulgarian offensive paratroopers have launched their own invasion of the Turkish homelands! The city of Denzili were their target, and with most of the Turkish army out of the immediate area, the troops were able to capture the town. This was more of a target to lower the moral of the Turkish more than a strategic decision, and it worked. <br />
<br />
OOC: <br />
<br />
If you make a new army, make sure you tell me where they start at. <br />
<br />
Tossi, you tried to move an air unit[s] to a province without a city for the air to land in. Just figuring this out, your 2nd air force has been removed and relocated to Apu. <br />
<br />
You don’t research a turn of a weapon unless you have it in your orders. <br />
<br />
You cannot have an army separated. Therefore it is impossible to drop paratroopers that are apart of an army that has more then just paratroopers. <br />
<br />
Sgt, troop transports for the air can only be in airforces, not armies.</div></div><hr />

Who are you to speak to us in such a manner? You have no bussiness inferrering with internal matters of the Spainish Kingdom,  we sugust that you watch what you say before you start a war.  We only wish to unfy both Portugal and SPain to the benfit of both nations.  We need Portugal to defend our selfs and to better both our economies.

News:<br />
<br />
Upon hearing the insulting remarks of the weak nation of Polland towards Spain,  President Franko had this to say:<br />
<br />
&quot;Polland should watch what it says to other nations.  This is an outrage that they would condemn our nation.  They think that they are a world power and can tell other nations what to do.  We the Spainish people find this very insulting.  Polland has no power over Spain or any other nation in Europe.<br />
<br />
Polland has clearly made it self a eniemy of Spain.  ANd from now on Spain will treat Polland the same.&quot;<br />
<br />
The President has layed out a new campagin to show the evils of Polland and the nations it supports.   Soon all schools in Spain and the Media will be putting out reports of the evil deeds that Polland has commited through out history down to our present day.<br />
<br />
In other News, the President is offering full Spainish citizenship to all those who live Portugal if they sign document renoucing those who oppose the unification of SPain and Portugal.  He also will soon chose a Portugese person to become governor of Portugal.<br />
He also signed a law that those who activily oppose the new SPainish government will be executed for treason.<br />
<br />
A new capagin will start to be run in Portugal to show the benfits of the unfication of both nations and what happens to those who oppose Spainish rule.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To Germany<br />
While we are sure that we did not provoke you - we just made our point clear - we find it of great pity you would not sign a pact of non-agression. That clearly shows your intentions regarding the free city of Danzig and the german minority within Poland's territory. Therefore if no immediate assurance of mutual respect will be made, Poland's government will have to move its german population out of the country, so that Germany will never have any claim on any of our territory whatsoever.<br />
<br />
To Spain<br />
Poland knows that you are not within its sphere of influence. Nonetheless we don't understand that the nation of Portugal had to fall prey to your greed.<br />
<br />
To Romania<br />
Poland welcomes you to our Defensive alliance. We hope the future is a bright one.<br />
Furthermore we ask you to bring your war with Hungary to an end. It would seem that the facist faction there has been taken care of forever. Maybe their government is willing to join our alliance.<br />
<br />
To Russia<br />
The neutral baltic states will still be invited to our summit. Poland was planning on making Lithuania a territory of Polish influence, while Latvia will be under Russian influence, as soon as the alliance would be signed. The Baltic states surely would welcome our military help.<br />
<br />
To Italy<br />
If you would present that evidence before a international commitee, Poland may be willing to accept your invasion, as long as it is just temporary and in order to remove some evil-doers.<br />
<br />
To Greece<br />
Poland welcomes you to our Defensive alliance. We hope the future is a bright one.<br />
<br />
To Czechoslovakia<br />
Poland thinks you should reconsider your joining our alliance. Germany has a very strong interest in the region called &quot;Sudetendeutschland&quot;, and regarding the actions that were taken against the Nation formerly known as Austria (now Ostmark) we think it would be very unwise not to cooperate with Eastern Europe. We have the same interests here as Poland as well has a big german minority.<br />
<br />
To Hungary<br />
If Peace was made with Romania we would like to welcome you as a member of our alliance. What do you think?<br />
<br />
To Lithuania<br />
If you were to join our alliance we would have to coordinate our military planning. We would ask you to bring your military under our central command (This means that Poland controls Lithuania's army as well as their spending).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Poland is not planning to expatriate any of its citizens. We just wanted to show Germany that the Nazi government should not try to treat us as they did with Austria or try to pressure us as they did with Czechoslovakia, using the foul excuse to unite all people of German origin. If Germany uses this pretext to invade and annex its neighbours, we are forced to remove the possibilty to use this pretext.<br />
<br />
We just wanted to make clear that we are prepared to take extreme measures if we have to in order to protect our sovereignity.<br />
<br />
No Polish citizen of German origin will be expatriated, as long as the Third Reich tries not to meddle into our affairs. The well-being of these people depends only on Germany and the actions it takes against our country.<br />
<br />
Germany has no right whatsoever to tell other countries how to treat their citizens. The Jews there already have become second-class citizens. In Poland every citizen is treated equally and it does not matter what his origin might have been. So this is no argument at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Korean Tribune<br />
<br />
Danish Rally to Defend!<br />
The Danish army and defense forces are taken by surprise as they see the sky littered with soldiers that have dropped after a recent air fleet crossed the sky. Hundreds of Swedish soldiers are seen in the sky, descending onto Copenhagen and the surrounding areas. The Danish military no where to be seen, the Swedish have occupied Zealand with only minor casualties while fighting police and militia forces within the city. Huge Danish outcries are heard in Netherlands and Belgium, where both nations have declared war on Sweden! <br />
<br />
---Dutch Prime Minister Speaks Out Against Sweden<br />
“…and to Denmark, our loyal friends for the past decade, we pledge our support against the invading Swedish. The European Community is going through a dire time, empires are arising in the world with surprising haste, including the growing Swedish, but the free peoples of Europe mustn’t put up with such warmongering! We henceforth, with the support and backing of our allies, the Belgium, herby declare full out war upon the Nation of Sweden, in full support of the Danish. <br />
<br />
Greek Troops Attack Albania!<br />
The Greeks, out of complete surprise, attack the Albanian people in their own country. The thing is, most of the Albanian army was in the north, helping Yugoslavia defend from the Italian invasion, and so the Greeks were able to take much land, without heavy losses. After the Corinthian Guard occupied southern Albania, the Theban Airborne lands in the north and secures the many towns that are the most lucrative to the nation. Meanwhile, the meager air force that Albania did posses is destroyed as Greek fighters take control of the sky. <br />
<br />
Fighting Rages on in Yugoslavia<br />
As reinforcements arrive for the Italian I and II armies, the fighting increases. Osijek is the main target for the Italian I army as it launches several attacks against the city but are repulsed by the Yugoslavian Croatian Defense Force. The battles have left the city in shambles, a mere memory is the only thing left that can imagine the way the town once was. Stone buildings are piles of rubble, the people evacuated. Even though the Italian force is much larger, the Croatian Defense Force holds on. However, nearly half of all the Yugoslavian regiments in the force have been killed, and almost an equal amount, three mechanized regiments, have been destroyed in the Italian I army and an armored regiment. Meanwhile the Italian 42nd Air Marines lands on the Adriatic beaches, unopposed. <br />
<br />
---Paratroopers in Huge Trouble<br />
Sarajevo has also turned into a wasteland, the buildings that were once magnificent and the people cultured are now piles of brick and stone. The Baltic Show Down force from the Yugoslavians have showed up to hassle the paratroopers into relinquishing the city, and hassle they have. The Italians were reinforced with two new paratrooper regiments, but to no avail. They were instantly destroyed with the first thrust of the Yugoslavian force which almost penetrated the defensive line the Italians have set up. If this is let alone, it is only a matter of time until the paratroopers give. <br />
<br />
---The War in the Air<br />
Yugoslavian pilots finally engage with the air craft that has so disabled their country. The Italians are hit hard from the full force of the Yugoslavians, which greatly outnumber the 4th Air Corps. Over the skies of both Sarajevo and Osijek the Yugoslavians have attempted to regain air superiority, which the Italians have now lost. In the midst of the struggling, the Italians are unable to fully support the ground troops. So far, 2 bomber and 1 fighter wing has been shot down from the 4th Air Corps, and 2 fighter/bomber wings have been shot down by the Italians. <br />
<br />
---Battle of Adriatic<br />
Here the two fleets of the opposing nation clash. In the beginning, the Italians took a huge loss as the submarines in the U Boat Fleet was able to penetrate the hull of a destroyer and sink it in the Carrier ‘Adria + Ionia’ group. However, after a cunning display of carrier power, coupled with the battleship ‘Venice’, the Italians were able to fully destroy the Over Seas Attack Fleet of Yugoslavia, sinking a destroyer, frigate and a battleship. Meanwhile, the subs in the Ionian continue to hunt for each other, but none are found. <br />
<br />
Portugal Under Control<br />
Following the last battle of Porto, the Portuguese have fallen to Spain. The escaped army from Lisbon were found in Porto, raising an army of militiamen to fight the Spanish occupiers. Luckily for the Spanish, most of the militia deserted their position when they saw the 1st Armor Division, but some stayed. The battle that happened afterwards was humiliating to the Portuguese. Nearly five infantry regiments were destroyed, with only one mechanized infantry division being destroyed of Spain. <br />
<br />
Budapest Captured!<br />
With the victorious Romanians walking through the streets, Budapest finally falls after huge bombardments from the Romanian air force that flew from Yugoslavia. Budapest fell without a fight, but that’s not to say the rest of the country did. Another large battle took place in Szombathely, where the Hungarian army stopped a Romanian advance by the 1st Armor Division. Mostly a guerrilla battle, the Romanians suffered a mechanized regiment lost. All of the country but the city of Gyor now lie in Romanian hands. <br />
<br />
---Many Hungarians Happy<br />
With the hope for Romanian institutions to one day be found in Budapest, many Hungarians, that is to say more than what was expected, are happy to be annexed. A regiment of infantry is being mobilized as you read this to be presented to the Romanian army next month for membership in a volunteer corps. <br />
<br />
Bulgaria Falls<br />
The last major battle takes place on the river Iskur, where five infantry regiments have been formed by the Bulgarian defense force to face off with the Turkish Home Guard and Islamic Shield forces. The battle didn’t take long, the Bulgarian defense force was wiped out. The Turkish Home Guard took most, if not all, the damage. Two infantry and two armor regiments were lost, but it was well worth it most would say. Bulgaria is now in Turkish hands. <br />
<br />
---Bulgarian Paradrop a Failure<br />
The Bulgarians were easily mopped up by the Turkish forces present in that region. The moral rises from this and from the Bulgarian accomplishment. <br />
<br />
Austria, A German Province<br />
The Austrians have fallen this month to the added amount of German firepower against the small nation. This month it was quite easy for the Germans, the hardest mountainous areas were already captured in the previous months. However, a battle ensued before the captured of the largest city, killing two armor and one mechanized infantry regiments before it was taken by the 5th Korps. <br />
<br />
Soviet Union Expands<br />
With the final organization of the Red Forces in place, the soviet leader has issued an attack on Latvia, who is unprepared for such war. However, most of the Soviet soldiers sent are not used to an offensive war, and are poorly trained. Of the 2nd Red Army that was sent to Latvia, two regiments of mechanized infantry, regular infantry and armor were destroyed in the opening attacks. This has caused wide-spread dilemma in the Russian homeland, and has grabbed some tacticians by the hearts. <br />
<br />
OOC: <br />
<br />
Changed carrier details since it was so stupid for being so expensive. <br />
<br />
I have realized that I have not clarified this rule: Once a unit is placed in an army, it can not leave that army/fleet/squadron – even if to make a new one. <br />
<br />
I’m sorry about the problems I made last update, but if you would please tell me the problems outside your orders (I don’t read your orders until update) I would sometimes like to fix the problem before the next update.</div></div><hr />

Italian Units of the 1st National Paras advancing<br />
<br />
Soldato Alessandro Facheris was under heavy fire. His Coporale had ordered him and five other soldatos to take an important building in the center of Sarajevo. It was a two-storied building with massive beton walls. Alessandro couldn´t see any hints about what this building was before the massive shellfire from Yugoslavian tanks from the Baltic Showdown Force had burned the walls black.<br />
But Alessandro had no time to watch this building. An Yugoslavian FT-17 was fireing at him with his 7.5 mm MG. The bullets had already hit two of his comrades. Both lay death at the middle of the street. Their blood was streaming in a big crater. Alessandro was lucky that the bullets had missed him. The were crossing a wide street without much cover when they suddenly heard the french built tank comming around a corner. Allessandro had jumped behind half destroyed advertising pillar.<br />
Another 37mm shell exploded right next to him. The pillar was crumbling and a pretty big piece of the pillar fell right next to him. The next hit would destroy his cover. He searched for his commrades. Paolo, a burly 36 year old soldato from Rome was lying in a crater. He was alright, but he was ways to frightened to do anything. But his third commrad was missing. Maybe he had been hit too.<br />
Another burst from the machin gun hit the pillar. The main gun should be ready in seconds. He decided that the only way to save his life was to run to the other side of the street. He gripped his Carcano rifle and prepared to run...<br />
Suddenly he heard a sound of a cracking bottle and he heard somethign inflaming. Carefully Allessandro locked around the pillar. The FT-17 was in flames. The crew tryed to get out of the nightmare, but they got mow down by a submachine gun fireing at them from the left.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey Allessandro! Move you ass! We have a job to do!&quot;<br />
<br />
It was his third commrade.<br />

Italian Tanks and Soldatos of the II.Army advancing near Osijek <br />
<br />
Meanwhile General d'Armata Giovanni Messe was watching the battle plans. His troops had made some ground, but the Baltic Showdown force had arrived to help the Croatians. Luckily his Paras had slow down the advance of these well equipment force. The General was not happy with his troops. They should have conquered Osijek long ago. But the difficult terrain and the fierce resistance of the Yugoslavian forces had slow down the advance. Maybe the next month would bring better news. from the front.<br />

Fabio Belli crawled out of his Falco. His head was still aching. Something had hit his plane... He was ordered to escort an bomber wing when the Yugoslavian planes came out of the sun. Their machine guns had hit his left wing and he had to get his bird down. He hoped that the bombers hit their target... But suddenly a breath of gas was filling the air. The plane was burning!!! Fabio ran...<br />

Violence in Gdansk!<br />
Protestors, mostly of german origin, were arrested after a strike in Gdansk turned violent. Three police men were killed by gunshots as they tried to hold back the angry mob.<br />
The workers at a Gdansk factory laid down their work, hoping for better wages. Unfortunatly the owner had already found others to do the job. That is when the fighting started.<br />
The police is still searching for the murderers. The funeral will be held at the St. Claus Cathedral.<br />

Marshal migy-Rydz returns form Lithuania!<br />
The head of state returned yesterday, after spending over a week in Lithuania, talking to government officials. No public announcement has been made yet and it remains unclear what is going on, especially with the attack by Russia, a member of the East European Defense Pact, on Latvia only a week ago.<br />
<br />
Military Reforms underway!<br />
Although the British government did not accept our request, the Polish Army is restructuring itself. New tactics are being employed as well as new weapons. Furthermore the forts on the German border have been completed. This will make the defense of our country an easier task. <br />
<br />

<br />
To our neighbor Germany:<br />
Poland did not attack anyone in the Free city of Danzig. Military police forces of our garrison at the Westerplatte intervened after the &quot;Volkstag&quot; asked for our support. Danzig alone could not have handled the situation, so Polish forces tried to calm down the crowd. When the fighting began, they were defending not only themselves, but the city itself. Three Polish soldiers lost their lives that day defending Danzig and the &quot;Volkstag&quot;.<br />
Poland is reforming its military and has every right to do so. Almost every European nation has begun to upgrade its forces and Poland does not want to fall behind. Furthermore it is just natural that my armies are stationed at Germany's border, as it is the only country that threatens Poland. Germany has refused to sign a Non-aggression pact and is threatening this country as well as Poland's allies. If Germany would not act so hostile towards Poland there would be no need for this saber-rattling.<br />
Poland has no intention to invade Germany, that would be suicide, as the Nazi armies outnumber and outclass the Polish army by far. The Third Reich is just searching for a pretext to wage a war against Poland. The League of Nations surely will not tolerate any such action.<br />
<br />
To our ally Russia:<br />
Poland wishes you more luck with your campaigning next month. Latvia will soon be yours.<br />
<br />
To our neighbor Latvia:<br />
Poland advises you to end the bloodshed by surrendering to the Red Army. Do you really want to see your country and your people destroyed?<br />
<br />
To our neighbor Lithuania:<br />
Poland hopes you consider our offer.<br />
<br />
To our ally Romania:<br />
Poland congratulates you on your almost completed victory. A diplomatic delegation has been sent to Bucharest to celebrate with you.<br />
<br />
To our ally Greece:<br />
Poland hopes that in the future your campaign will fare as well as last month. Albania will soon be yours.<br />

Poland could not care less if you are getting angry with its government. We were not insulting Germany, just stating some facts. It is a fact that Germany has been re-arming in clear violation of the Treaty of Versailles and it is a fact that Germany has annexed one of its neighbours.<br />
Well, regarding the treatment of minorities, it is true there have been some minor incidents, but nothing major has happened. Our government would be glad to send you the part of Poland's constitution dealing with minorities, so you can see that they have equal rights.<br />
One the other hand you praise Germany a country that has even waged a war against its fellow Germans in Austria, killing many. Yet you complain about how Poland treats Germans. Now, that sounds biased to me.<br />
Regarding your invasion of Yugoslavia, if you had clear evidence why did you not present it before the League of Nations? No, instead of trying diplomatic channels first, you invaded your neighbour, although you had plenty of time to deal with it otherwise.<br />
It seems that the moral standards in Europe are declining fast and Poland now is willing to do everything it has to, in order not to fall behind in this new arms race.<br />
<br />
To our friend SWEDEN:<br />
Poland would like to sign a Non-aggression pact with your country at least for 12 months. Also the Baltic Fleet is planning to hold maneuvres in August, maybe parts of your fleet would like to join us?<br />

<br />
Korean Tribune<br />
<br />
Latvia Nation is Falling Apart<br />
Riga is captured by the Soviet forces of the 2nd and 1st red armies, while the first and second battlegroups of the soviet air force continues to reek hell upon the resisting Latvia ground forces. The country is overrun, and little resistance remains in the far west where a general is bringing the townspeople behind him. In the battle for Riga, three mechanized infantry regiments are harmed in the door-to-door fighting that occurred after the heavy air and artillery bombardment. An artillery battery was also ambushed by rebel fighters, destroying the whole force. <br />
<br />
Hungary Falls!<br />
The Romanian forces parade through the streets of Bucharest when finally the last bits of the Hungarian forces are wiped out in the northwest. Hungarian rebels are still at work though, sabotaging anything the Romanians station in their country. One such sabotage, the worste one, was a whole infantry regiment in the 1st Infantry of Romania that pummeled off a bridge when it was exploded. That was most of the losses this month in Hungary. <br />
<br />
Swedish Forces Stopped Just Short of Arhus<br />
Swedish parainfantry units advance very well this month, making their way to the mainland, the Jutland peninsula, and easily advancing up that to the resistance ar the second largest city in the country, Arhus. Arhus is a very important port to Denmark, especially now since it is the main port in which supplies from Netherlands and Belgium arrive through. Although the Swedish blockade of the North Sea is holding up well, some supplies still leak through the lines and into the Danish ports. A few parainfantry regiments are lost in some battles, but the force still remains resilient. <br />
<br />
---North Sea under Attack<br />
The Swedish have imposed an embargo from Dutch and Belgium shipping from reaching the ports of Denmark. And so the combined Dutch and Belgium navies meet the Swedish defense force in the sea – and are obliterated. Aided by the use of a air craft carrier, the fleet is able to destroy the combined navies without one loss to a ship. <br />
<br />
Croatia Under Heavy Fire<br />
The Italians and Yugoslavians are still fighting over this province. Most of the Croatian military has been long since defeated, so the fate of the country lies in the hands of whoever wins the coming battles. The Italians greatly outnumber the Yugoslavians, yet the Yugoslavians have the support of the Croatian civilians and military remnants. Nonetheless, the Italians drive back the Yugoslavians with minor losses while the Yugoslavians have huge losses. <br />
<br />
The Invasion of Italy<br />
Spotting their chance, the French launch a huge invasion of the undefended Pie province of Italy. First, the paratroopers drop in near the provincial borders to the rest of Italy, and finding little resistance, they call in that it is safe for the full force. Three more French armies invade the small Italian province, and it is now under complete control of the French. <br />
<br />
---African Wars<br />
The French continue their war against Italy in Africa, where the two French armies stationed in Tunisia and Algeria launch a full invasion of Libya. Both armies advance well into the land before the Italians notice it and begin to move west. No losses from either side has occurred yet due to the late Italian arrival, though it seems like some hard battles will be fought here in the desert sands. <br />
<br />
Ireland under attack!<br />
British commandos landed on a beach near Dublin earlier this week. At first their hearts were slashed when word came that air support and paratroopers were not going to be able to make it due to the long journey, but they were soon revived when they found out how poorly the Irish fought. They quickly were able to secure Dublin and advance into Northern Ireland before the month’s end, only loosing one regiment in the battles. <br />
<br />
Germany Continues to Attack<br />
German forces now strike behind the barricades into the Slo province of Czechoslovakia. At first it didn’t seem like the Germans were going to be able to make it into the province until a second attack from the north, the 7th Korps, surprised the rear of the Czech 2nd army and was able to break through. The German forces are now pushing hard against the 2nd Czech army, and are on their way to what seems like a violent future. Many losses took place in the infantry ranks among the Czech army, but only sporadic, random deaths in the German army. <br />
<br />
Poland to Invade Lithuania<br />
Polish forces force their way into the virtually unguarded southern border of Lithuania with full force. Army Group E makes their way north through towns like Alytus, and finally captured the capital of Vilnius, which falls quite easy. Most Lithuanians easily accept their fate of becoming Polish citizens, but some do still fight on. The losses include two infantry regiments that died captured Vilnius and one when capturing Alytus. There was barely any battles this month, more are expected. <br />
<br />

<br />
Forgive me for the lack up updates and for the shortness of this one, I am in a hurry.  <br />
<br />
Tossi, I was in a hurry this update and could not change the names, I will do it next time, sorry L. Also, you didn’t have enough transports to drop your army. <br />
<br />
France, I also had to move your 3rd squadron back in France because of no air port in Tunisia, sorry for the inconvenience. <br />
<br />
Armies are for land forces only, Sgt, so I made your 4th Squadron be of transports instead. Also, air support could not reach Ireland, as it violates the air craft movement rule.</div></div><hr />

And yes, there was a bit of fighting in Pie, but mostly with small militia and France had sent a whole lot. <br />

We assure you no British ships will be harmed in the blockade. However we advise you to not send ships bound for Denmark until the war is over. If you want to send ships to the Baltic I would recommend a Royal Navy escort so we do not have to board your ships.<br />

Let it be known that we condemn your betrayal of a sovreign agreement with Italy.</div></div><hr />

I had signed all NAP's undertimes of peace.  It was Italy's fault for declaring war on my ally.  I understand why you should condemn my actions, but I was defending my ally against an aggressor.  I would expect my allies to break a treaty to defend a friend.  So, if it shall be France vs. the world so be it.  I was just acting to save a friend.</div></div><hr />

Could anyone who is not playing now please tell us so someone can take your nation?<br />

Fom the top of my head, Spain, Yugoslavia, and Greece did not send orders last time.</div></div><hr />

You must understand that I am not alone. My allies Russia and Poland will protect me if it comes to intervention from countries other than Italy. If Italy decides to withdraw from Yugoslavia I will not intervene though or if Yugoslavia accepts a cease fire on other conditions.<br />

Allies, we might need your help if it comes to war. Please support us in this matter.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you should consult your allies first, before you drag them into a full-scale war. Stay where you are and take care of your own business.</div></div><hr />

You want to order us to leave yugoslavia? You soon will be split between the winners of this war! you should start thinking about your surrunder, because the glorious Italian army and it´s allys will get you.<br />

We see this as declaration of war. We didn´t care abou your attack of hungary, and we don´t know why you should care about us! We only know that you are in range of our military and we know that your tiny nation is much smaller they greater Italy.</div></div><hr />
