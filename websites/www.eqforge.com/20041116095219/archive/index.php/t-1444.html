<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squirrel2004</div><div class="date">May 27, 2001, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm currently working on 2 scenarios that I'm using a &quot;Suburbia&quot; terrain for (it's pretty cool). The graphic I'm using for this new terrain is the same as the extra small modern city under Cities.gif. However, when I try replacing the glacier graphic with the new Suburbia graphic, it doesn't work, and I still get the glacier graphic. <br />
   I tried copy Terrain1.gif into Paint, pasting the new Suburbia graphic, and saving in my Germany and America files (the two scenarios). That doesn't work either. I'm pretty new at this so can somebody explain to me how to do this?<br />
P.S. - Whoever made that Ultima scenario would know, I saw in the screenshots, they used the small medieval village for a terrain.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">May 27, 2001, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are probably just replacing the graphic in the wrong place or the wrong file. Try putting a big red dot on the existing glacier graphic and see if it appears in the scenario first.<br />
<br />
You cannot copy terrain.gif to paint and then use it (either as bmp or gif) because the palettes are wrong. If you want to use paint, get an existing bmp terrain file from somebody elses scenario and use it as a template in paint first.<br />
<br />
If I am not mistaken, the Ultima scenario uses airfields to do the small hamlets.<br />

I suggest you to use editors like Paint Shop Pro (it's shareware, you can find on the net)</div></div><hr />
