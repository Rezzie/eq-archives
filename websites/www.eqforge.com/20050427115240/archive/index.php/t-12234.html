I no longer have my GOTM #2 saved games on my computer because I reloaded the game with the patch and intentionally deleted all of my saved games.  Since all of your email was erased and with it, all of your submissions, would you (or anyone else, for that matter) care if I played and submitted again?  If not, my first game was a loss around 700AD with a point total near 650.  I was conquered by the Romans.</div></div><hr />

For my opinion it is fair to take the &quot;loss around 700AD with a point total near 650&quot; as your result. If you play again you will have a great advantage. You know where to get the horses and the iron, and where to find the other civs.<br />
<br />
So don´t play again, we trust you. (I don´t think anybody would create a loss to be part of the competition...)</div></div><hr />
