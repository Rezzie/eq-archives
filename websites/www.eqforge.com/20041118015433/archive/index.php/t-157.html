If you send a caravan from one city to another, it increases food, but decreases from the other city, thus not improving your score.<br />
<br />
Is there something I'm missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smash</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2001, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes you are missing something &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif&quot; border=0&gt;.Each food caravan fills half the foodbox.Every time you fill taht foodbox you get a new citizen.Regardless of whether local food supplies can support it or not.The supplying city is given a-1 food route.You can send countless food feights from that city and only have the 1 food route.<br />
<br />
Xin Yu had a system worked put where you sent them in a big loop.It was rather complicated.<br />
I just rename citys to something like &quot;USA Foodbank&quot;.I leave a small food surplus in that city and sell sewer/aquduct to keep it from growing into negative food supply.Then every city around builds food freights which are funneled thru and resupported from the foodbank cities.Then send them out.<br />
<br />
very tedious<br />

<br />
Is this to say that with the Pyramids (already keeping your food box half-full) a single food freight will boost population by one?<br />
<br />
Also, I'm guessing that you could use a pretty big city or two as your foodbanks.  Even with a -1 in food the pyramids will guarantee that the city would not lose any population for a good long while.<br />

Good thing to know. This explains the size 60+ cities in the Apo HOF that have over -20 food. i'm going to test this right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smash</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2001, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes 2 caravans or 1 with granary/Pyramids.<br />
<br />
Once you get into a negative food situation you need 2 with granary or 3 alone.<br />
<br />
No reason you can't take 254 cities to size 127.Except you would probably go insane first.30,000+ points awaits anyone willing to abandon all cept Civ.</div></div><hr />

You could have food parnters, or triplets. What you would do is trade among the 3 or 2 cities, instead of a huge circle. That way, it won't be so tedious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smash</div><div class="date">Mar 15, 2001, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes!Thats almost exactly how Xin handled it.He had cities like 1a,1b,1c,2a,2b,2c etc</div></div><hr />
