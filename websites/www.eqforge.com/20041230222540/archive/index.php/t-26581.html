<br />
Tonight I'm checking out Openoffice, but what about an email client prog with a callander and concatct list like Outlook?<br />
<br />
Or better yet, what about an internet browser?  I've used Newplanet and picked up a virus right off the bat.  Opera isn't bad, but doesn't have nearly any of the multimedia capabilities.<br />
<br />
Any idea's?</div></div><hr />

Linux is free, of course, and there is no Microsoft software compatable with it.  If you want a good email program, use Pine.  OpenOffice isn't bad at all, but you can always get StarOffice for $30.<br />

But if you just don't want to pay for MS products, there's always the other alternative. ;)</div></div><hr />

The problem Lostman is that it takes time to develope software and that is why MS charges for it. Blue's suggestion of going Linux is a good one since you get get everything you want from MS there except for Games....gaming hasn't gotten good on there quite yet except for a few programs (Quake 3 is pretty good from what I hear, achieving frame rates equal or better than MS systems). <br />
<br />
I have only had problems with Linux though...mostly related to my video card (and I have the vendor approved driver also).</div></div><hr />

Netscape is a good browser for Linux, BTW.<br />

Quake, as well as all game servers (including HalfLife), are faster and more stable under Linux.  More and more games are ported natively to Linux these days.  You can run many MS programs through Windoze emulators like &quot;WINE&quot;, though with a speed hit due to overhead.<br />

One alternative for MS software is buying through auction sites.</div></div><hr />

Have you ever tried to run CIV3 thru a Linux win emulator? I'd like to try that some day, haven't gotten around to it yet. (I play CIV3 so slowly the slow performance hasn't bothered me that much).</div></div><hr />

Linux will run most programs from 3% to 10% faster. For the games that are ported over. There are still a LARGE amount of new games that haven't been....don't forget that in your Linux fevor. ;)Netscape is a good browser for Linux, BTW.Maybe compared to all other Linux browsers....didn't impress me when looking at IE 6.x. IMO of course.Quake, as well as all game servers (including HalfLife), are faster and more stable under Linux.I can believe that...Linux is a good server OS from what I hear (and I believe it) but not for everyday use for 'most' people. More and more games are ported natively to Linux these days.  You can run many MS programs through Windoze emulators like &quot;WINE&quot;, though with a speed hit due to overhead.I hear WINE is a horrible way to play games....especially FPS (First Person Shooters, like Quake) where FPS (Frames Per Second) count. I also heard about the major porter of MS to Linux games went out of business.....not a good sign for Linux games.One alternative for MS software is buying through auction sites. Buyer Beware!!!! Watch out for getting illegal version....not really your fault if you do but the way MS is going about updates (like with XP) you won't be able to install Service Packs (SPs) if you don't have a legal copy. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jul 09, 2002, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">but the way MS is going... <br />
Hopefully, right out of business.  hypothetically, the computer world would be best served in the long term if all Windows based software was suddenly and irreparably infected with horrible viruses.  The migration to Linux and Unix would be fantastic, and all developers would simply shift.  Of course, a few folks would whine... but MS is the reason the PC state of the art in software development has been so stagnate since 1992 or so.<br />
<br />
My solution is rather simple.  Saddle M$ with an approximate $1.4 trillion (yes, that's right... trillion) dollar charge against earnings.  Let the stockholders absorb the next 15 years of  &quot;losses&quot;, and pay damages to the hundreds of companies, thousands of inventors, and millions of MS Software buyers around the world.  The company value is ill-gained and corrupt, and more than that, their defective products have caused billions of lost man-hours in productivity worldwide.  We are owed damages.<br />
<br />
Also, all MS source code should be released (special act of Congress) as complete and unrestricted and fully commented and documented  FREEWARE.  Not even GNU.  But totally free and open.   Moreover, all MS software and intellectual property that cannot be returned intact to its oriiginal inventors/owners, should be made availabe for free.  No charge.  Zip.  Nada.    Except for printing, distribution costs of the CD's.  All future software that has a byte of defective or buggy code shall render that software as freeware, and beta.  Executives will be executed (isn't that what the term &quot;executive&quot; means???).  Preferably mass hangings, but firing squads will do fine.  <br />

I've downloaded OpenOffice today, it looks quite professional although I haven't really worked with it yet. Some things are quite annoying though and are better thought out in MS programs. But it's free so I really shouldn't be complaining right? ;)</div></div><hr />

It is BETTER than that!!!  YOU PERSONALLY can make a contribution, if you choose!!!  You need only visit the website, and help debug, beta test, make suggestions, write code, QC, etc. etc.....  unlike MS, you can actually help, if you choose.<br />
  OpenOffice is a fast-moving, continually improving product that releases an improvement every couple weeks, and major versions every few months  :)  :).<br />
<br />
Or people can of course use it for free :).  A very nice thing is that it is essentially the same across a wide variety of platforms!   :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lostman</div><div class="date">Jul 10, 2002, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried OpenOffice and dig it.  I miss some of the keyboard shortcuts in the spreadsheet end of it, but I'll cope.<br />
<br />
For the record, I dislike MS becasue of they're spyware practices, they're overcharging of the software (personal) and they're crappy licensing agreement (business).  They find any way they can to make moiney and steal info off of the consumer.<br />
<br />
I pray that Lindows is as succesfull as they are saying it will be.  So I'm using Opera at home and Open Office, now I just need a good email clent.</div></div><hr />
