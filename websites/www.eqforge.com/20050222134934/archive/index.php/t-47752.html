EDIT: As DoM notes below, it would have been good to add an overview of the situation..  So here's one again so you don't have to scroll down the page for the image ;)<br />
<br />
  White lines -&gt; Movement paths<br />
  White dots -&gt; Possible spots to settle<br />
  Red dots -&gt; Possible specials..<br />
<br />
<br />
Since Jayne needs to know where to move the units by tomorrow GMT, I've posted a poll about it..<br />
<br />
I've tried to include all the given opinions on how to move the units from the 'Next turn - 3900bc' thread..<br />
If'I've missed an option, please post it in a reply to this thread..<br />
<br />
EDIT: if you want the archer to move otherwise, post a reply..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I voted to move the south settler south-west to the 3-special spot, and move the north settler south-east to the other 3 special spot.  We will get some overlap this way, but only a non-shielded grassland and a jungle.<br />
<br />
We can then build a city on the north-east grassland square later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, yea..<br />
But, as Jayne wants to move by tomorrow afternoon, i thought we had to hurry a bit..<br />
And i'm deputy domnestic advisor, so i figured it wouldn't be much of a problem</div></div><hr />

<br />
I voted to see the archer move SE, S. The S. settler to move to the SE city spot. You forgot to include an option for the N. settler to move to the SW city site. But that would be what I would of vote for had the option existed. :p <br />
<br />
Anyway I think what ever city site is chosen by the S.settler it will be good enough. Jayne is going to have to play out atleast 3 turns before posting anything as there is nothing that can be achieved in 2 without AI confrontation. If it all goes well we should be discussing build orders by mid monday.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I didn't know. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesn't really matter which of the settlers go to which of the spots with 3 specials, as the South settler will take 2 turns to get to either and the north settler will take 4 turns to get to either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm glad you noticed that the timing was close and that the Domestic Advisor hadn't posted a poll yet.  Hopefully you also sent them a PM letting them know you did so so that they don't suplicate the effort and make a new poll as well.  Communication between Advisors and Deputies will greatly improve the experiance everyone has with the game. :)<br />
<br />
BTW, attaching a picture of where we are may help people decide a little better. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Mar 17, 2003, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:goodjob: , DvR, it's perfectly all right that you posted the poll.<br />
<br />
 Given that the domestic advisor has not posted a poll I think DvR's should be accepted. Jayne will need the information on Monday, UK time so the domestic advisor has left it too late to organise anything.   <br />
I'm sorry I didn't post the poll. I know though that Jayne is good at making decisions, and we were having a discussion in the turn-thread about this, so I thought that'd be enough. Once again, I'm sorry, and will make a poll next time:( <br />
<br />
I voted to settle capital sw w and to find a better spot for the second settler. I forgot to vote for the archer, but the only option seems to be winning anyway:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Mar 17, 2003, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted N-settler to go SE to investigate, and S-settler to settle in SW position.

<br />
Thanks for doing the poll. I plan to move in about 6 hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
check above :D<br />
<br />
I voted N-settler: Build road on shielded-grassland square and S-settler: Settle where he stands.. Mainly because the spot where the S-settler stands now looks like a good spot to me, and we don't know much about the other two spots apart from the fact that they 'possibly' contain specials.. <br />
Especially because this is a demo game, i think we shouldn't take too many risks..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Mar 17, 2003, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted to move the archer SE-S (actually SE-SE might become possible too) and the S settler SW-W. Also to move the N settler SE but there's one thing that would change my opinion there: If the archer (which should be moved before anything else) reveals bad terrain (mountains and desert) I'd want the N settler moved NE to found a city.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have nice turns for us !</div></div><hr />

What is that Archer doing in there. I thought the Archer movements were controled by the Military Department.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Mar 17, 2003, 06:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the moment it's an exploratory unit.

<br />
I had not thought of this possibility. Hence disregard my earlier post and vote. I too am in favour of moving to the SW city site with the S.settler ASAP! Still, I would like to see the N.settler move down to explore the SE city site with the archer. <br />
<br />
Funxus, all is forgiven. :)</div></div><hr />

Well, to make it official, I authorize the use of that Archer to be used as a Explorer (Just need to cover the back of the Domestic Advisor from a PI, Dont mind me, the Civ3 DG Rule sets are drilled in my head ). I was not sure if anyone was poping up supprise Polls. (I do want to commit more than I did the last time)</div></div><hr />
