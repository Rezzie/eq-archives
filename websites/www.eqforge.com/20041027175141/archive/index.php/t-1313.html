Why not any Sci-fi show or movie? Losts of people are into Science fiction, so it could work out really well. For the page we could have updates on new trek shows and movies, ideas for scenarios and maybe units for common usage in scenarios. Besides you and me John, how many of the dudes here know about the Star Trek Animated series? It could open up a whole new world of scenario concepts. I know there are a lot of Dune fanatics here also, and there has been only two Dune scenarios, and they are only so-so. And of coyrse B-5, and Star Wars, lots of material to work with. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

Misread the original post. I meant YEAH Star Trek site.....wouldn't have it any other way. But B-5 and other SciFi scenarios could have their own sub-section.<br />

I don't need a good grade, though. In Holland, you get a grade between 1 and 10. I scored three tens, and this trimester is almost over (just two schooldays)<br />

There shjould be a forum or page, just for Star Trek and other Sci-Fi. There could be numerous Star Trek scenarios. I'd like to see one that plays in the old days (with the Enterprise A). But not many people have seen those (at least not in my country, I did only see a few). Something more about the Borg (that's why I create the Borg vs. Species 8472). I've already seen a Cardassian Occupation scenario, but I didn't like it so much. A Klingon-Cardassian War scenario culd be good, or maybe a the (civil) war between the Vulcans and Romulans.<br />

<br />
This sounds like things are coming together...so let me get this straight...<br />
<br />
You are all saying that we really need an area dedicated to &quot;SCI-FI&quot; and that there are of course certain sections that you want to see developed:<br />
<br />
STAR TREK<br />
BABYLON 5<br />
STAR WARS<br />
<br />
Possibly DUNE, and a few others...<br />
<br />
with a section just for ALL OTHER SCI-FI as well...<br />
<br />
Maybe a page where all the graphics and sounds are linked to...and a few resources for building these scenarios...<br />
<br />
I have to say that building an ST scenario or any other SCI-FI scenario does have special challenges to overcome...<br />
<br />
AofA, I agree on the range of material...we do need to cater to the community that supports all sci-fi scenarios...<br />
<br />
And Kobayashi...I totally agree that many scenarios are out of date...we need some current sci-fi...<br />
<br />
willemvanoranje, there are very few older ST scenarios...but I guarentee you there is going to be another one....hehe...but a page would help and maybe we could challenge scenario authors to make the &quot;best sci-fi&quot; of the year or something...<br />
<br />
Are there any other things that we should think about for this page--? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Mar 26, 2001, 10:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been giving this some thought:<br />
<br />
The page could be a mini civfan with the following sections:<br />
<br />
1. scenarios and modpacks<br />
2. resources like units, icons and cities<br />
3. links to other trek and Sci-fi pages for background info<br />
<br />
but not its own forum as that would dilute the scenario creation forum<br />
<br />
We should be careful about putting a proper disclaimer as well.<br />
<br />
If thunderfall is making the actual HTML, he can use the LCARS elements and buttons from my own website. That should save some time and effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Mar 28, 2001, 01:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good note about the disclaimers. Paramount is rather strict on that kind of thing...Lucas Films as well.<br />

<br />
However, that doesn't mean that we can't post about the sci-fi topics. That is how a following is built up.<br />
<br />
WE had some good ideas going and should continue to explore them, especially in the area of scenario creation.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would like us to get together as a team and figure out how to produce some sci-fi scenarios that haven't been done yet...or haven't been done to our expectations...<br />
<br />
There are a lot more tools available now for scenario making that wasn't around in the past...we could update a few ideas...<br />

I have been asked by three other people to test their scenarios, Willem! I wish I could help them all, but to really do a good job as a playtester, you must give a scenario your undivided attention, so as to spot errors, playbalence problems, and historical mistakes in them. From your posting here, you must be feeling better. I'm glad to hear of it! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif Why not ask Kob for some help with the events file problem?

Your right about taking the time to do good play testing. It is fun but at the same time critical when you are trying to do a good job. I appreciate all your feedback because eventhough you say you are just a player, your help can guide the creative process through an opinion that is from a different perspective...in a way, you enter the creative process because your &quot;ideas&quot; are involved.<br />

<br />
Alcibiaties was a greek general in the Pellponesian war between Athens allied cities and Sparta allied cities. He first served Athens, then later Sparta in the same war! My grandfather was born in Athens, and my grandmother was born in Sparta, so the name brings out the duality of my heritage on my father's side. If it makes things easier, you could just use my real name in the read me. Alcibiaties was been my web name for many years, but somebody (who has never posted &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/mad.gif&quot; border=0&gt; ) had it first, so I had to add 'of Athenae' to the name.<br />

<br />
Interesting about your name AoA...I knew it was Greek. I'd like to go to Greece someday. <br />
<br />
willem, your idea about a Cardassian occupation scenario is a good one...in other words...you want something just before the return of Bajor and the emergence of the wormhole but after the major part of the Cardassian conflict...hmm...that is interesting...possibly I could do something with that...if you don't mind.<br />

Someone already made a scenario about that, but I wasn't quite satisfied about it. There are only 5 units or so, and it's all the same.<br />

Email me the author, any details, where it is posted or send the scenario to me and I give it a try...I could do something with that one I think...<br />
<br />
Currently, I am testing the &quot;Wrath of Khan&quot; scenario that I've done for the ST:Generations patch. <br />
<br />
willem, I swiped a couple sounds and modified them from your Kappa Scenario, which I must say, keeps distracting me from my work.<br />

You ca find it over at Geo's and he is right, it's pretty lame. There are Galor cruisers flying over a ground terrain and stuff like that.</div></div><hr />

I was going to ask people if they had Borg sounds (for SThttp://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/biggrin.gifelta). I can't download all the files, there are only a few available for download.<br />
