                  <p>You start out in Halas, a not very large town but it has 
                    just about everything you need. Wander around a little and 
                    hail the npc's to see if they have anything interesting to 
                    say. Some of them may want to send you on quests, and some 
                    of those quests are simple and useful at the early levels. 
                    Then, when you've memorized your spells, take the ferry across 
                    the lake. After your first trip you will probably start doing 
                    what most people do, which is to swim across. It's usually 
                    faster and it increases your swimming skill.</p>
                  <p>On the far side you will zone into Everfrost. This is your 
                    hunting ground, and is divided into two halves. The eastern 
                    half is the plains, full of nasties that you don't want to 
                    go near for several levels yet. Far to the east is permafrost, 
                    a dungeon for very high level characters; you may notice powerful 
                    players coming through on occasion because of this.</p>
                  <p>The western half of Everfrost is a maze of paths that wind 
                    between frost-covered hills and chasms. This is the newbie 
                    area, with Halas on the north end and Blackburrow on the south. 
                    It's easy to get lost out here; there are not a lot of players 
                    about, and there are many things for you to kill. It's an 
                    excellent place to hunt. Everything except the spiders and 
                    skeletons are agressive and will attack without provocation, 
                    especially gnolls and goblins. You can get in over your head 
                    very quickly, and you can get lost easily if you wander. Stay 
                    close to home for the first couple of levels... you will find 
                    yourself running for the guards with a sizeable train following 
                    at some point. Gnolls and goblins carry money and sometimes 
                    sacks and backpacks or other good loot, so kill them when 
                    you can, and kill any skeleton that carries a weapon, especially 
                    a staff. The merchants by the tents in the cavern will give 
                    you a good price for them.</p>
                  <p>I strongly suggest teaming with at least one other player, 
                    even when you're starting out. The beasties will gang up on 
                    you, so you need to gang up on them. At some point you're 
                    going to find yourself waist-deep in polar bears, wolves, 
                    goblins, and gnolls, and you'll need help taking them all 
                    down. Don't be shy -- ask others, especially those of about 
                    your level, if they'd like to team up. It's for your own safety, 
                    and theirs as well. Just two players of 3rd to 5th level can 
                    wade through a pile of beasties without too much trouble, 
                    especially if one is a shaman.</p>
                  <p>Going solo, even at 5th level, is more of a risk. I can't 
                    stress enough that you will, at times, be battling 3-6 beasties 
                    at once. Multiple polar bear cubs can wear down even a 5th 
                    level character who's soloing.</p>
                  <p>Save those ruined bear pelts, and if you don't take up tailoring, 
                    find someone who has. There is no excuse for a barbarian to 
                    not have a set of patchwork armor by 6th level at least; polar 
                    bear cubs are everywhere and drop pelts a lot, so the raw 
                    materials are more plentiful than anywhere else that I know 
                    of.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366" size="3">Level 5</font></b></p>
                  <p>You get new spells, including Frost Blast (which will immediately 
                    replace your flame blast as your preffered direct damage spell) 
                    and Gate, which instantly transports you back to where you 
                    spawn when you die. What's not so cool about this is that, 
                    for a fifth level shaman, it will cost more than half of your 
                    mana to cast, and may well fizzle out. Practice it a lot. 
                    It will allow you to not worry about getting lost, but it 
                    isn't a great way to excape a battle at this level. There 
                    is also the spell Sicken, a direct damage/poison spell which 
                    you can't get in Halas but you CAN get out on the plains. 
                    It's well worth it, but this might be a dangerous journey 
                    for a 5th level shaman. Ask a more powerful shaman about where 
                    to find it and how to get there safely.</p>
                  <p>Gnoll pups, goblin whelps, and decaying skeletons are no 
                    longer worth experience points. Unfortunately, bears, wolves, 
                    and spiders don't carry weapons or cash, so you may find yourself 
                    killing the smaller monsters anyway. More powerful gnolls 
                    and goblins can be found, but not easily and not a great number 
                    of them. Until you reach sixth level, it's still a good idea 
                    to take on every bear cub and wolf that you find.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366" size="3">Levels 6-7</font></b></p>
                  <p>You can now wander the newbie area without fear, but will 
                    find precious little worth killing, just the occasional wooly 
                    spider or goblin scout. It's time for you to move on, and 
                    this means either to Blackburrow or to Qeynos Hills, on the 
                    other side of Blackburrow. If you group with others, you might 
                    brave the Everfrost plains, but there are lots of nasties 
                    out there than can chew through a 6th level shaman in a hurry. 
                    If alone, I reccoment killing the four gnoll guards that spawn 
                    at the entrance to Blackburrow, or hunting in Qeynos Hills. 
                    Otherwise, you should group. I also travelled to Western Karana 
                    at this level (very dangerous) and the Toxxilia forest near 
                    Erudin (across the water, you will need to group to hunt there 
                    and there are few players about to group with). Basically 
                    these are really difficult levels to get through, you just 
                    have to persevere.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#333366" size="3">Levels 8-9</font></b></p>
                  <p>When you reach level 8, make a trip back to Halas and put 
                    one practice point into Meditate. You will be ever so grateful 
                    to have this skill! At this point, you are going to want to 
                    save all of the money you can just to buy the 9th level spells 
                    once you get there. You can hunt in Western Karanas or on 
                    the Everfrost plains with a little more confidence at this 
                    level, but the best loot will come from the gnolls in Blackburrow, 
                    and you need the cash. Group if you can, and if you're desperate 
                    for cash, bash on gnoll pups and goblin welps/scouts. You 
                    won't get experience, buy you'll raise the capital you need 
                    for your spells.</p>
                  <p>When you reach 9th level you will get some very nice spells. 
                    Spirit of Wolf is a very cool spell; you can make friends 
                    everywhere you go by casting this spell, and you can earn 
                    money. More importantly, you can run from all of the nasties 
                    out on the plains or in Western Karana, save the dreaded hill 
                    giant. You can hunt with confidence now, even kite a little. 
                    Also you'll get Tainted Breath out on the plains (your first 
                    serious Damage over Time spell, although still not that great), 
                    and if you go to Qeynos and have a human friend buy for you, 
                    you can get Serpent Sight. You will never need a lantern or 
                    torch again.</p>
                  <p>Once you've gotten a bubble into 9th level, you are more 
                    than ready to make that trip to Rivervale, Freeport, or even 
                    the far continent of Faydwer. As a precaution, bank any possessions 
                    you can't afford to lose, then cast spirit of the wolf and 
                    run run run! The further you get from Halas, the fewer shaman 
                    you'll find, and the easier it will be to group with other 
                    players. However, if you only get as far as Rivervale and 
                    Misty Thicket, you will at least have found a great place 
                    to hunt for the next two to four levels. Have fun!</p>
