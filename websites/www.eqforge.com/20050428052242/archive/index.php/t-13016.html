I just want you to know that the GTOM is a great idea. I play civ since the first one but never been very good. Always stood at chiefstain, warlord... But with that, I can play at greater level and get advice at the same time! It helps me a lot in my civing, cuz it is better to play at greater level. I never knew how to manage those other civ that were going too fast for me!!... more realistic and challenging too... anyway ....<br />
<br />
Dunno if I'll be able to finish GTOM2 in time, I've begin it yesterday... well, I'll submit GTOM3 if I can't make it in time!<br />
