<br />
And it probably depends on the kind of program you would write, but for YOU, which would you prefer.<br />
<br />
Also feel free to argue and post pros/cons  about the 2 languages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaEezT</div><div class="date">Jul 07, 2002, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">unless I am very mistaken, VB means Virtual Basic...<br />
Comparing Basic to C/C++ ... well... at least it's a change from all those C vs Java discussions ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jul 07, 2002, 06:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">VB is Visual Basic and I might be wrong here with my next statement but I believe this is an MS only language? Meaning that only Microsoft can make the compiler for this....<br />
<br />
C++ has many different types. I am not an expert or even a novice...I just know some things. There are four major compilers: Borland C++, Microsoft Visual C++, Watcom C/386, and DJGPP. Visual is just the compiler (it does have differences but if you are talking about the actual language it is just C++).<br />
<br />
Then there is also C without the ++. <br />
<br />
Visit this site for information on C++ programming:<br />
http://www.cprogramming.com/<br />
<br />
Visit this site for VB:<br />
http://216.26.168.92/vbworld/default.aspx<br />
<br />
I have heard that Visual Basic is easier to learn and use but that C++ makes more powerful and faster programs. May I suggest an option for none is better, they each have their uses? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CornMaster</div><div class="date">Jul 07, 2002, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I vote VB...because that's all I know. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jul 07, 2002, 09:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">VB and VC are indeed MS programs.  More than that, it is their attempt to take over the programming world, like they effectively have for HTML and like they attempted to do for Java  (remember Visual J++ ?? ).<br />
<br />
I voted for Other.  However, C++ is superior at the end of the day.  But Basic/VB is easier for most people to learn over C/C++/VC++.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">VB is becoming more powerful.  It used to be that VB was only really useful if you wanted to work with forms - if you wanted more advanced programs (graphics etc), forget it!<br />
<br />
VB 6 is a bit of a step forward in this respect, bringing it more towards what the likes of C++ can do.  This &quot;section&quot; of VB is a lot harder to learn however.<br />
<br />
I voted for VB, as that is the one that I use.  However, I think a &quot;better&quot; answer is that it is a horses-for-courses approach.  For simple programs, VB is probably easier and faster to write a program in, so &quot;better&quot;.  For complex apps &amp; games, you wouldn't dream of using it - C++ all the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I vote C++ because I use it. Although I am sick of it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Homie</div><div class="date">Jul 09, 2002, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gonzo, why are you sick of it? Is it because it is difficult or time-consuming to code in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jul 09, 2002, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">C++ is much better, with more features, better algorithms, faster processing, more powerful routines and more. :yeah:<br />
<br />
But VBasic is easier to learn. :eek:<br />
<br />
If someone already knows C++ or Java or similar languages, there is absolutely no need to learn VB, but if you are new to programming and want an easy way to program a bit, VB is probably better suited for that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I´ll take C++ and Java first anytime.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Jul 12, 2002, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Gonzo, why are you sick of it? Is it because it is difficult or time-consuming to code in.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've been coding and debugging it for years and I am sick of seeing it. But it's better than VB!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padma</div><div class="date">Jul 12, 2002, 08:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">VB is definitely easier to learn for the novice. C++ allows the programmer finer control over the detail level of the program, thereby making it more &quot;powerful&quot;.  However, if most C/C++ is as poorly written as the stuff I have been having to maintain for years, then the programmers are wasting their time.<br />
<br />
In any case, the &quot;best&quot; language is the language that is optimal for the project at hand.  It might be VB, it might be C/C++, or Java, or even Ada!  (But no, I don't think the &quot;best&quot; language could ever be PowerBuilder! :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jul 12, 2002, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is PowerBuilder? I have heard mention of it at the place I currently work (up until 2 days from now) but I thought it had something to do with databases....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padma</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">PowerBuilder is a VB-like tool originally built by PowerSoft (now owned by Sybase).  Initially, (early '90s) it was more popular than VB!  But since then it has declined in popularity, going from some 70% of the Rapid Prototying and Development market down to sheer insignificance.  It's only &quot;good&quot; point is a fairly decent database interface.<br />
<br />
If I had been around when the programs I maintain were originally written, they would have been in VB.  If I could re-write them from scratch, today, it would be Java or C++.  As it is, I'm stuck with PowerBuilder.</div></div><hr />

Heck, i can't get EITHER of them to make a peep out of the speaker, though i'm only 14, so i havn't wrote some killer dos app or somthing</div></div><hr />

I've participated in vb:c++ debate so many times it makes me sick. There are no better or worse languages &amp; each of them was made for specific purposes.<br />
This thread could be named &quot;vb vs. c++ experience sharing&quot; &amp; be more constructive.<br />
&amp; for the record: I was originaly vb programer but had to learn c++ to trully understand all the nonsense microsoft implemented or left in vb.<br />

C# rulez</div></div><hr />
