<br />
Sharing Program used: Windows XP PRO ICS<br />
<br />
Gateway Computer: Doesn't matter, runs windows xp pro and ICS, connected to outside ADSL modem &quot;Alcatel speed touch home&quot;. Has 2 NIC cards, each one made by a different company with different cheap set. One connected to the network and one to the ADSL modem. Carries the IP 192.168.0.1 for the network and 10.200.1.1 for the ADSL modem.<br />
<br />
Client Computer: Doesn't matter, runs windows 2k pro and uses ICS, connected only to network through 1 NIC card, carries the IP 192.168.0.158<br />
<br />
<br />
Problem: when I use ICS I can't reach certain sites. Such as  bankhapoalim.co.il, pandas.co.il, bezeq.co.il ONLY from the client computer.<br />
<br />
Those sites are fine and reachable from the gateway computer.<br />
<br />
I tried to configure the DNS server in the client computer, did that succesfully. So the problem is not the DNS.<br />
<br />
Also a few internetional sites are unreachable, such as news.yahoo.com <br />
<br />
I can ping news.yahoo.com, I can ping pandas, I can ping bezeq.<br />
<br />
But the sites just won't show in IE, it's like they take ****s time to load and they don't load eventually.<br />
<br />
I fixed the problem by installing the AnalogX proxy server and using it instead of the ICS. BUT It keeps crashing here and there and I can't fix it. <br />
<br />
I changed the config of the gateway computer from Pentium 3 to a 2Ghz pentium 4, new HD etc and a new installation of Winxp Pro. Didn't help.<br />
<br />
So my questions are:<br />
<br />
1. Can it be fixed? How?<br />
2. Where can I find other free proxy servers to try that do not crash?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
E.g., instead of:<br />
<br />
/www.zzzz.com/<br />
<br />
use this:<br />
<br />
/111.111.111.111/<br />
<br />
(Fictional Examples)<br />
<br />
I personally have to use this method to access certain cites, esp. Apolyton.  It's a DNS issue<br />
<br />

<br />
It sounds like you've pretty much isolated a fix.... a good proxy server.  I can't recommend one, as I'm not using any right now.  But I used AnalogX a long time ago with no problems.... long before WinXP.   Personally, I use Win2K and Win 95 OSR 2.1 for most things.  <br />
<br />
BTW, How does AnalogX crash?  Any messages or BSOD's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceBlaZe</div><div class="date">Jul 13, 2002, 04:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last time it crashed it said something about corrupt memory and it had something like 'http.c' or something in the error message.<br />
<br />
No BSOD, only the AnalogX crashes, not the comp.<br />
And it's also not a problem to turn it on again afterwards.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to the next question:<br />
<br />
How do I make windows keep a program consqequently on? <br />
Meaning: If it crashes, I want windows to operate it again automatically.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
The easiest way is just to copy a shortcut to the Startup directory.<br />
<br />
You can also put the path and name of executable into this key:<br />
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\<br />
<br />
Here is the basic editing procedure of the registry, which is similar in WinXP:<br />

<br />
I'm talking about the situation where the program crashes but windows does not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jul 13, 2002, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahhh.... I know what you're asking now.  <br />
<br />
Hmmm.... you're looking for a program to monitor the machine state and can contitionally initiate programs, and I'm sure there must be something, but I have not used one and can't recall a built-in setting in Win2K or NT, however.    It would need to be a TSR of some type.<br />
<br />
Maybe a server Admin might know.  You might ask an ISP techie in your local area.  :)</div></div><hr />

You have a RFC1918 address anyway so it may be worth swapping to something else. Subnet 0 isn't always implemented reliably, and even if you're confident it is your kit it may be worth changing just to elliminate it as a cause.</div></div><hr />
