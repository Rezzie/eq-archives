For some reasons I thought it was either after Weekend or on the 2nd (Friday), and I don't know which one is the correct deadline.<br />
<br />
Either way, I probably won't be able to finish (1600AD in the middle of Industrial Ages, not in a outrageously dominant position, fastest I can do is try for a diplomatic win with UN but that is still 10 or so tech away - min 50 turns - and not 100% sure as Japan and America are furious at me and, if now, election might be against Persia).<br />
<br />
So this is my question, should I send a not finished game for statistical or whatever purposes or just consider that it will be another GOTM without submission for me ...<br />

PS large map are so long to play, 1600AD and there still are empty islands with barbarians...</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you don't have to submit, cos I only want finished games. Unfinished games won't come in the ranking and are also useless for stats, so don't bother. ;)</div></div><hr />
