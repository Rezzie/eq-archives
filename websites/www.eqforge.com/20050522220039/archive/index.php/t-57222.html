<br />
I have cancelled that last turnchat I had scheduled for this term so that our Term 3 leaders can determine their own path.  After all, you see what happens when an entire tenure as President is defined by the previous administration.<br />
<br />
I would like to thank all who voted me into this position and apologize that this term was one of the least productive in DemoGame history.  Having experienced the role of President firsthand, I now have an even stronger respect for each citizen who has held this office before me.  Unfortunately, I did not have enough free time to adequately lead the nation and it shows.<br />
<br />
However, I will take none of the blame for the situation we are in regarding the city of Memphis.  I presented a clear vision of how our country could progress if we left Egypt's mainland alone, defined our borders just north of Byblos and built a great nation south of that stronghold.  But few listened to the man they elected to lead them, and now we are studying culture flip charts instead of power charts.  Our only consolation is that we have two of the proponents for continued war(at the time) running for President, so I am sure they will be able to provide a solution to this mess that I may have missed.  And hopefully the people of Fanatica will trust and support our new President's leadership more than was displayed this term.<br />
<br />
In closing, I would once again like to thank my supporters and pledge to lend my support to anyone who has the qualities and dedication to make Fanatica the greatest nation in the world.  After much thought, I have decided to take the month off from seeking elected office, and concentrate on the new mod position that landed in my lap.  I plan to use this opportunity to try and bring some excitement back into this DemoGame.  Please wish me luck.<br />
<br />
Respectfully,<br />
<br />
Donovan Zoi<br />
President of Fanatica</div></div><hr />

I believe it wrong for you to apoligize for being unproductive.  Your actions were all entirely justified due to lack of indicated direction by Fanatica.  I would only be truly angry if you had ploughed through the entire mess without a clear mandate on the actions to be taken.<br />
<br />
Thank you for handling the situation approiately,<br />

<br />
I believe something good can come from the situation, which simply put is not your fault at all.  The customs and traditions of the past, blindly followed so far this game, encourage leaders and those who believe they should be leaders to fight each other, instead of the in-game adversaries.  There is nothing to gain from placing blame on each other, nor is there any point in taking blame where none exists.  I have seen too many instances where the specter of a PI causes indecision, or forces us to accept an outright wrong approach which is advocated by a very small minority.<br />
<br />
All citizens should consider a new dedication to the principle that we all, together, create the game for the enjoyment of all.  Failure of the citizens to participate should not be considered grounds for thinking less of our leaders.  The leaders have a responsibility to seek out the will of the people, and follow it where it is clear. When the people's will is indeterminate, the leaders need to consider their very election as evidence that the WOTP is to delegate authority to the leaders, and it is permissible, and even expected, that leaders shoudl be able to act independently when required.</div></div><hr />

I applauded as you took the Presidency. It was a tough situation to begin with. Because of the disaster of Term 1, the picture I had of you when you entered office was one of the guy who tried to keep as many dishes spinning on the top of tall dowels as possible. Very few times did you not see one of those guys break a dish. :D<br />
<br />
The Presidency is a very tough position to fill. Period. I could see your frustration during most of the term. I thought you did a pretty good job, myself. Now you have your name on the list of Presidents and that's a good thing. I now applaud you as you enter Modhood. Congrats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I nominated you for the Presidential office, some 30 days ago. I've had my times of disappointment when your plans again were voted off, time after time. And you were forced to fight a war. <br />
<br />
I had my moments of doubt when the turnchats were either cancelled or ended after 1 or even 0 turns. I haven't joined the TC before, so I don't know if other Presidents had the same situation, but try to change that next time. <br />
<br />
Also your colleagues (Shaitan and Chieftess) left the game during your term so you were left out in the cold. You still managed to keep the plates spinning. <br />
<br />
I will nominate you again for president in due time.</div></div><hr />
