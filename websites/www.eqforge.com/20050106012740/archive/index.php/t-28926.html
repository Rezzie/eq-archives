What a review of history thru the net.  They even mentioned the game of &quot;Empire&quot; in the GNU article.... many people probably don't know that Empire is the forerunner of games like Civilization and Age of Empires.  I still have a 1981 version of Empire for Dos that works on my machine.... it's the only game that has run on every PC compatible machine I have owned. :)</div></div><hr />

That was a quote about the first Simpsons! How many of the other cartoons listed have you heard of....... :lol:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zwelgje</div><div class="date">Aug 07, 2002, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first review of an IBM-PC:<br />
For those of you who stay in touch by computer rather than paper<br />
or radio: Here's the latest on the IBM PC.  It's a three-piece<br />
unit, VERY slim nice-looking keyboard, with basically the same<br />
key layout as the 5250 series.  The display looks cosmetically<br />
the same as a displaywriter's, and sits on a logic box with dual<br />
diskettes.  Inside we have an 8088, up to 256K, five expansion<br />
slots, 80x25 screen memory with graphics 320x200 or 640x200.<br />
Figure it out, that means an OK but not great 8x8 character<br />
cell.  The unit displays up to 16 foreground colors on 8 back-<br />
ground colors (but I doubt if all those are available in the<br />
graphics modes).  And you get a sound generator and built-in<br />
speaker to boot!<br />
<br />
The thing is totally modular; even the I/O cards are separate!<br />
For $ 1,565 you get a keyboard and logic unit with 16K RAM and<br />
a Basic interpreter in 40K ROM.  A cassette interface is built<br />
in, I think; but no diskette or monitor at this price The computer guys are still the same, what can you expect more for this price??? :lol:-- you<br />
use your TV set.  Of course you can add one or two minidiskettes,<br />
lots more memory (16-64k increments), a B&amp;W monitor (no color<br />
monitor was mentioned), RS-232C interface card, matrix printer,<br />
a joystick/paddle interface (but you have to buy somebody else's<br />
joysticks and paddles); and maybe the kitchen sink.  A &quot;business<br />
configuration&quot; with 64K, dual diskettes, printer, and &quot;color<br />
graphics&quot; goes for about $ 4,500.<br />
<br />
The big news might be the software -- there's plenty of<br />
it.  If you don't like their idea of a diskette OS or Pascal<br />
compiler or word processor, you can try USCD Pascal or CPM-86,<br />
coming soon from Softech and Digital Research.  (Gee, and I<br />
was looking forward to JCL).  And then there's Visicalc, three<br />
Peachtree business applications, Microsoft Adventure, 3270<br />
emulation on the way, and a new IBM Software Publishing outfit<br />
(!**8).  It looks like they read Byte.<br />
<br />
Where can you get it or ogle at it?  Try your local Sears,<br />
Computerland, or IBM store (or DPD sales rep, if you're a<br />
big banana).<br />
<br />
:lol:<br />
Now those are some statistics to drool about....;)</div></div><hr />

were (in hindsight) some really funny predictions in there!</div></div><hr />
