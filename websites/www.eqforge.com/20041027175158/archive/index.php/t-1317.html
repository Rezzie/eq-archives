<br />
Does this mean that stealth is based on the slot in units.gif? So any unit in the slot for submarine, F-22 or B2 will be &quot;invisible&quot; to other human players?<br />

You notice there are numbers behind them. 000000000001, or soimething. Go just above the settler, you'll find a small index there. It says whatnumber is SUBMARINE ADVANTAGE. This gives them stealth.<br />

<br />
-A ground unit with sub habulity can't attack any unit<br />
<br />
-an air unit with it can't fight any unit OVER THE LAND<br />
<br />
-a missile con stay on a sub-type unit without run of fuel, but if the unit is ground or air, the missile won't sleep or follow automatically the unit, like it would make if it was a REAL sub, check this:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arius</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2001, 04:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so that has the Sub covered. Remove the submarine advantage, and it's a regular naval unit. Great! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
(There are no subs in my setting)<br />
<br />
But what about the Stealth Air units then (B2 bomber and F-22)? What makes them stealthy, and how do I make them not-stealthy? What happens if I just make them ground units? Will they still be &quot;invisible&quot;?<br />

They are just stealthy in real life. If you make them ground units, they will be ground units (using the swordfight.wav).<br />
<br />
I have brought up the matter of the sound elements because that is really the first thing you must take care of. If you do not want things to get too complicated, use the User and Extra unit slots instead (and make the prerequisite of all unwanted untis to NO NO)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arius</div><div class="date">Mar 28, 2001, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, thanks Kobayashi!<br />
<br />
I have set the Carrier, Sub and both &quot;Stealth&quot; air units to no, no already, but I wanted to know if I perhaps was able to make use of those extra slots anyway.</div></div><hr />
