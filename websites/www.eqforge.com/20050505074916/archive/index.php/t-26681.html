<br />
I have heard that ICS is a good way to push up your score, and I know about keeping the areas around your palace and FP not too dense as they will be the only productive cities.<br />
<br />
Is there anything else? Do you find it easiest to take out civs early and just leave a few small cities left to take for the victory at the end?</div></div><hr />

Work for hours and hours without fun just so you will get higher on the GOTM ladder??<br />
I have never milked a civ game for score, and I never will.</div></div><hr />

Winning itself is boring, and I wouln't mind a comparison to others. Also, I have a week to kill before the next tournament game is released :)<br />

Maybe you are right though. It does seem to be amazingly slow and boring, and to be honest I don't care about being on the GOTM ladder. Also, I don't intend to play many GOTM games, just when the tournament allows.<br />
<br />
Does anyone go for an early finish? If so I may decide to do that instead, as I'll still have a comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bamspeedy</div><div class="date">Jul 09, 2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if you do decide to take the milking route, you should definitely read Sir Pleb's article: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=18729&amp;pagenumber=1 <br />

Yes, there are awards for fast finishes, so you could use that as a motivation/competition/comparing yourself to others.  There are awards for a fast victory for everything but a diplomatic victory (too similar to a quick spaceship victory).<br />
<br />
ICS does theoretically slightly reduce your scoring potential because the city center tiles are only giving you two food, which could provide 4 food (if on grassland, irrigated, and railroaded).  However, ICS gives you faster growth rate and less improvements needed to keep all your people happy (unhappy people give you 0 points), so ICS more than makes up for the slight drop in scoring potential.<br />

Is there anything else? Do you find it easiest to take out civs early and just leave a few small cities left to take for the victory at the end? <br />
<br />
Leave them with only 1 city.  Plant a city in the middle of a desert and donate it to the last civ, just before you destroy all their other cities.  A city in the middle of a desert, that will be forever stuck at size 1 (can't even build a worker) will never be a threat.</div></div><hr />
