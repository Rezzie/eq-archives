S. R., they then speed away into the darkness, what became of them may never be known.<br />
<br />
the last word heard from Helen I before she left; &quot;with technolagy the world shall life for longer, if we only built the puzzle&quot;. these words would later be imortalized by Archanames Se-El III, a great writer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andrew510</div><div class="date">May 16, 2003, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aunis walks toward the town, he has two axes straped to his back, he holds a jade knife, and his belt has a bow and a qivver. he walks up to a villager, holds on to him, and dos't let him go.<br />
<br />
Townperson: please, don't harm me, i have only this.<br />
<br />
*townie gives some bits of jade and copper to Aunis*<br />
<br />
Aunis: have noticed that you are nothing but pawn to my plan?<br />
<br />
Townperson: what plan?<br />
<br />
Aunis: i will give you some pure gold, and a bow&amp;arrow, if you help to defeat the despot, and round up some other townies to help.<br />
<br />
Townperson: i will give you anything for my life.<br />
<br />
Aunis: good, my plan will start when i have a wife and a child, then, we go out and kill despot in the night, and leave no trace as we slip into a hut in the wild.<br />
