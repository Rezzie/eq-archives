winxp actually is pretty damn good.  I've never had one software or hardware issue that wasn't easy to resolve, and it's only ever crashed once (when i tried to enque 2065 mpcs into winamp, and it tried to load a separate instance for each one).  I've had winxp ripping audio from two drives, and encoding to mpc, AND listening to music, and no crashes/speed issues.  But maybe that's just my badass system.

ME does win, but in my 5 years w/95 I only had to restart due to system failures about 10-20 times.....one of the most reliable OSes I've seen(aside from DOS/CPM :))<br />

<br />
<br />
Your first choice is very credible, but I'm afraid to say and I'm not alone in saying this, that XP is most definately not deserving of the runner up position here. In fact, if you are looking for compatibility and tons of features XP is really the top of the line. In any upgrade you lose compatibility but XP has done a good job of stopping that.<br />

She had 10 computers at her office and asked me to install Norton internet security 2003 on all of them. Everything went well, until I installed on the only XP machine... Crashed. Then reboot. I tried to uninstall it to reinstall it more properly. No way. XP won't let me uninstall it, saying I was not a superuser therefore I couldn't uninstall anything. Well, I was logged under the main administrator of the machine... No comment. :mad: Xp... as someone said, with 95 we were in front of a cliff, with XP we made a big step forward...

What's the deal with anti-Microsoft?  Microsoft is one of the best!  I resent people that go up on tv and tell you why you should switch from a MS to an Apple.

<br />
Currently on my computer I have Win XP Pro and Linux Slakware 8.<br />
<br />
I never even ONCE experienced a crash from XP, but Linux, other than being totally redundant, got stuck once.<br />
<br />
When I had Windows 2k Pro, which is a wonderful OS by itself, it crashed exactly ONE time when I tried to run a very old Dos game.<br />
<br />
Windows 2K has reliability that is on par with Linux, and tops Mac OS 9 and X.<br />
<br />
Windows XP is basically 2k with added compatability, user friendly features, etc. I can't say anything against it.<br />
<br />
Other than the fact that the Toyish GUI is more system-heavy than the good ol' style that was first introduced with 95, I must say I have nothing against XP.<br />
<br />
95 was Okay, it was quite a breathtaking improvement from 3.11, but it had performance and reliability issues for me. Too many times the computer got all bungled up.<br />
<br />
98 (Not SE) was Awful. Crashed all the time.<br />
<br />
2K was enormous. Excellent OS, almost no Crashes at all, very fast.<br />
<br />
XP for me is just like 2K but more compatible with Everything. It's like a Wish come true.<br />
<br />
Linux Slackware 8 is... Reliable but useless.<br />
<br />
Since XP works so smoothly, I so no need for using Linux.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I own/have used every version of Windows and MS DOS since the beginning.<br />
<br />
Of the Microsoft lineup, here is my ranking of all their OSes. Starting with best and ending with worst.<br />
<br />
Windows 2000<br />
Windows XP<br />
Windows NT<br />
Windows 98 SE<br />
Windows 98<br />
Windows 3.11 for Workgroups<br />
Windows 3.1<br />
Windows 95<br />
MS Dos 4.0 and up<br />
Windows ME<br />
<br />
Why did I give these rankings? My judgement is based on experience ranging from: a)Ease of Use; b)How stable it is (or how often you get the Blue Screen of Death; c) Compatibility; d)versatility; and e)innovation<br />
<br />
Windows ME introduced nothing new, and only proved to be the most unstable OS they released.</div></div><hr />

Win95,98,and SE, were all better than win3.11, win for workgroups, and win NT if you aren't going to be networking. Of course, even if you are networking they're all better than 3.11(what's that even doing that high ;))<br />
<br />
Of course, I guess 3.11 does score innovation points :)</div></div><hr />

Windows ME was the worst release ever by Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I own/have used every version of Windows and MS DOS since the beginning.<br />
<br />
Of the Microsoft lineup, here is my ranking of all their OSes. Starting with best and ending with worst. I see you don't mention the earliest Windows releases.:)  They were really bad, especially compared to the earlier Mac OSes.  I do agree that Windows wasn't worth mentioning until 3.1 (or really, Win95), but let's not forget the REALLY bad old days of MS...  Mac had the PC (GUI) world to lose, and they sure enough did.  I do agree, WinME is the worst of the recent releases.  I'm glad it had a very short life.<br />
<br />
And in the great OS debate (Windows, Mac, Unix, other), I will always maintain that the best and worst OS depend on what you need to do.  Use the best tool for the job, and everyone is happy - well, almost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Win ME is the worst OS. I've tried some Macs, some are ok, I just don't like Macs. <br />
<br />
I've had a celeron pc with Win 98 for about 3 years now. I have a Win ME pc P3 866mhz, for 1.5 years and the ME has crashed so many more times! 98 crashes now alot too as the pc is old but the ME crashes are all wierd and you have to do 500 things to fix it. Can't just turn it off and then on and let it check the C Drive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Cause it ran the first CIVILIZATION 4 DOS!.....<br />
<br />
.....perfect, at speed, soundblaster sound and without ever, ever crashing!!<br />

Well, I appreciated MS DOS 6.22 more, since it also had useful functions such as memmaker, or undelete or deltree. Well memmaker was less efficient than QEMM though and I had already programmed in C++ a deltree program. But undelete did come in hand damn often. Actually, even nowadays, at work when I have to do some files/disk operations I always launch the console box and type dos command. That makes my colleagues laugh but well... it's unix habits too.</div></div><hr />

The worst OS in the world is SYSTEM 8.1 Hell, any MAC OS sux.<br />
<br />
I only say 8.1 cause our school imacs use it.  Nice 13 inch scratched displays that the idiot tech people are always putting on 1024x786.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Microsoft has been striving for everyone to be on an NT type OS for years but they couldn't just switch becuase of compatability problems, so every version of NT that came out since NT 3.51 had a DOS like version released too, for NT 3.51 it was Windows 3.11,<br />
for NT 4.0 it was Windows 95, for Windows 2000 it was ME, <br />
basically it's an afterthought and a spiced up 98 which is a spiced up 95.<br />
<br />
ME will be the last DOS based OS that Microsoft will ever make<br />
<br />
Goodbye DOS, long live XP</div></div><hr />

The interface is simplistic and inefficient. Customisation of important functions within the core of the OS is non-existent. Conversion will be made to a Linux based OS with the acquisition of new hardware and construction of network. Afterwards Microsoft will be irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

Linux is strictly for the geeks.  Computer geeks and all that understand Linux.  Even with its new Lindows and all it's still not up to steam with Windows.  And if you download Linux you gotta download all the programs yourself as well.<br />
<br />
I resent Macs because of their commercials, they really drive me nuts.  I tried Macs once and didn't see the glamour and hype that the switch people say.  Maybe if I owned one I'd see but $1300 for the sunflower mac is a bit high. <br />
<br />
You can buy linux distros at frys with more software than you'll ever need.  If you can insert a cd and click yes a whole bunch of times, you can install linux.</div></div><hr />

That thing is horrid. I just *hate* it when I get a bug report from a client using Windows 95. I wish I didn't have to support it. It's impossible to develop on; if a program crashes, you have to reboot the machine, if a program leaks GDI objects, awful things start to happen.<br />
<br />
I just shudder at using it. It's bad, real bad.<br />

This is a logical statement but it would seem that logic is lost to those that brand Linux as useless. The case for Linux does not need to be made. The serious computer user already knows. That is all that is important on this issue.</div></div><hr />
