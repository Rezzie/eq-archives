The 'FREE' part is important!</div></div><hr />

Smartftp is probably the best ftp client around. Really user friendly, and everything is easy. Use it each and every time :D</div></div><hr />

I suggest WS_FTP, one of the most trustworthy clients ever. Has all features needed and works fast and well. :yeah:<br />
<br />
http://www.ipswitch.com/<br />
<br />
The trial version doesn´t expire (at least the one I have doesn´t) and is more than enough for all needs.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

I tried ws_ftp a while ago and didn't like it... It looked too technical, at least for me... Smartftp is translated in most languages, has a nice visual easy to use interface. Serisously, it's like using your own computer ressources. IIRC, ws_ftp was maybe a bit faster, but only smartftp's look beats any other ftp client. :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

i type in the address to connect to.  i type in my username and password.  as it goes through the connection process, it finds the server, accepts my username but then says 'Password required for mchorlton' and 'Login failed'  i don't get it because i have entered my password and it IS correct.  i have put in everything my ISP says i need to (i.e. the address to connect to, user name, password).  i have 50Mb of webspace, 512K broadband connection.  what's going on???</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pillager</div><div class="date">Sep 21, 2002, 01:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend both SmartFTP and WS_FTP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Sep 21, 2002, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not free per se, but Bitbeamer is my weapon of choice with the solid as a rock WS_FTP backing me up when I need it.  Bitbeamer is great for FXP too, much better than FlashFXP, but I doubt you need FXP capability, mchorlton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Sep 21, 2002, 06:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WS_FTP is a smooth program, about $50, and I've recommended it to clients (in the USA) who use it for followup maintenance to my websites. <br />
<br />
I picked it in the first place for this great reason: when I'm downloading, it stamps the webserver's date/time into my system.  I can easily track what is going on, see if other people are changing some of the files, review their code, whatever.<br />
<br />
You see, this way I have 'Mirror' backups on my local system.<br />
<br />
Also, I have copies of its WS_FTP.INI file backed up to other PCs and offsite.  It is loaded with IPs, logins, passwords, directory names, G: drive, whatever -- details I'd hate to ever loose.</div></div><hr />

This may be true.....since i don't know what it is!!!<br />
Out of curiosity...what is it??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Sep 21, 2002, 11:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that FXP allows you to move files from one FTP server to another instead of downloading it to your computer then uploading to the other server. Nice idea but never heard of many people using it....although I can see how it can help at my work place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Sep 22, 2002, 01:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The PaleStallion is correct.  If you want to move data from one FTP to another you could download it from FTP A to your computer then upload it to FTP B.  This however takes a lot of time even one broadband connections.  Instead using FXP you can move it directly from A to B.  This can be extremely useful when both FTPs are on T1 or T3 lines.  <br />
<br />
Most people, however, don't need this capability.  Only people who maintian several FTPs and need to move large amounts of information from site to site use it.</div></div><hr />
