You can toggle wonders to count also as objectives, so that a certain city can count for more points, if it has wonders in it. You do it by right clicking on a city and pressing CTRL + C (or edit city via the Cheat menu), and then assign it as objective.<br />
<br />
Then you set up the victory conditions, which  basically is how many points a player needs to &quot;win&quot; the game in the given time.<br />
<br />
-As for good scenarios and maps, just browse these forums for a while. There should be plenty to pick from!<br />

SOmehow after I've set them up they just won't work when I play my scenario! And I can only set them to one objective-point for a city.</div></div><hr />

You must be using Test of Time or MGE. The 3 point objectives in these versions don't work. This is a know bug! You'll need to limit yourself to 1 point objectives and counting wonders as objectives if you don't want every city to be the same value.<br />
<br />
When you're limited to one point objectives, you probably don't want to assign every city as an objective. You'll have to think about what is important. This may not necessarily be a function of city size, but other things such as location may apply as well.<br />

It will be marked besides the city name on the city screen.<br />
<br />
-About this bug, oryx, I haven't noticed. My version of MGE seems to have no problem with more objectives, and runs very well with multiplayer and the objectives. In &quot;Hammer..&quot; I had many cities with x2 or x3 objectives and they work fine. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ptolemy</div><div class="date">Jun 14, 2001, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, I do not rum TT or MGE. I have ordinary civ2. And Morten Blaabjerg I do run them as scenario files(.scn). But still, when I do my best to make it work it won't, well, I'm going to try again today.<br />
<br />
Something else, what is TEst of Time? I've never tried it. Is it good??</div></div><hr />

Morten<br />
For me and many others major objectives do not work. Sure, you can check the major objective button when you set up the scenario, but when you play the game and you posess the objective, you don't get 3 points for it.<br />
