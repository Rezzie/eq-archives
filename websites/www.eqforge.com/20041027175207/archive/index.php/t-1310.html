Actually, this can cover just about any ground you want to talk about from scenario ideas to things you wish could do but have never been able to achieve...<br />

There is plenty of challenge out there...so what would you like to see?<br />

Well, I don't know if this is possible with the Civ2-engine, but I would like to make a city improvement required for the production of a certain unit.<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
-Only cities with the Factory improvement can build Armour units.<br />
-Only cities with the Manufacturing Plant improvement may build SpaceShip parts.<br />
-Only cities with the Port Facility may build Battleships and Subs.<br />
<br />
I doubt that this is possible, but it would be great if someone could figure out a way to do it. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

<br />
<br />
If a city builds a XXX (improvement or unit) is not a valid event trigger.<br />
<br />
The closest thing I can think of right now is to set a city to building something and then removing the enabling technology from the race. The city will continue to build the unbuildiable unit until the owner changes it to something else. This has been used in many scenarios like JM's Third Reich and the Lord of the RIngs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ok... but then you would only get the unit the first time you built the factory! What I meant was that say you have 4 cities, 2 with factories, 2 without. Now, the 2 cities w. factory could be set to build tanks, but in the other 2, tanks are not allowed.<br />
<br />
Kind of in the same way that inland cities can't build naval units...<br />
<br />
Getting the technology when building your first factory is a very good idea (that way your empire has at least 1 factory!), but not quite what I was looking for.<br />
<br />
For example, I would like it to be so that if your spy sabotaged the enemy Factory, he would not be able to build more tanks until he rebuilds the factory.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I doubt it can be done in a practical way...<br />
<br />
But hey, you ideas were still quite good. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />

willemvanoranje is talking about Test of Time which added several new triggers and actions to the events language.<br />
<br />
kobayashi is talking about FW/MGE events.<br />
<br />
Although they sound like they are contradicting each other, both are right.<br />
<br />
Arius, these are all good ideas for CIV III.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Mar 21, 2001, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, there could be some changes done maybe to make this happen...we have to quit thinking in 2 dimensions and start thinking in three...<br />
<br />
Arius you said:<br />
=================<br />
Examples:<br />
-Only cities with the Factory improvement can build Armour units.<br />
-Only cities with the Manufacturing Plant improvement may build SpaceShip parts.<br />
-Only cities with the Port Facility may build Battleships and Subs.<br />
================<br />
<br />
perhaps by taking the parameters of the &quot;MAP&quot; into consideration and the attributes of the unit...then, we could change the land terrain to &quot;sea&quot; and the sea terrain to &quot;land&quot; and place land squares in the some of the resource sections and call 'em &quot;isles&quot;<br />
<br />
Here is where your cities can build the tanks...tanks can only be build by coastal cities on isles in hiding away from your enemies or close to ports (ships would actually be ground units because the map is reversed) and only using the &quot;port facility&quot; changed to the name &quot;factory&quot;.<br />
<br />
the only problem is that this would reverse all other unit aspects, but you might be able to have &quot;oil tankers&quot; for trade and no way to found cities except on the little isles!<br />
<br />
not much of an idea is it?<br />
<br />
I actually saw a scenario in which the land/sea graphics were reversed...I doubt I can find it on my harddrive but I can try...<br />
