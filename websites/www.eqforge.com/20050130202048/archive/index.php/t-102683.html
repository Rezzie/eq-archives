I got into it when I took the Operating Systems course in my master program. Before that I did nothing much about Linux or Unix except using pine for emails. During the OS course we were required to hack the Linux kernel on vmware. That was a big step. There were 5 projects and I learnt a lot from it. I got an A+ by the way, and ever since then I've been a Linux lover. It also gave me a great job one year later. You just can learn so much when you have the source code of a real operating system.</div></div><hr />

BTW, I think your post scare the non-programmers away... some Linux distributions, like RedHat or Mandrake, are actually quite easy to install and use even for the average guy/gal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chairman Meow</div><div class="date">Oct 20, 2004, 04:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have several Linux distributions and FreeBSD installed on my computer, and they each have their own role...<br />
<br />
<br />
 Mandrake makes a good easy-to-use Linux, especially if you don't want to do a lot of tinkering with the system. It does tend to run a bit slowly, though, so it may not be that great for older computers. <br />
 Fedora is the descendant of Red Hat, and, like Comraddict said, is easy to use and professional-looking, though I've found that the Fedora releases can be somewhat buggy.<br />
 Slackware is a slim, quick-running distribution, a bit unfriendly towards people who have never used Linux, but excellent for people who want their computers to run fast, or for people with older computers. Installing software can be a pain, though, as it uses its own format for software packages (tgz), which many places that offer software don't use, meaning that you often have to compile from source.<br />
 Debian... I attempted to install this on my computer... it installed, but couldn't get into X Windows, and my ethernet card didn't work, so I didn't really get deep enough into Debian to say anything about it...<br />
 FreeBSD technically isn't Linux, it's a variant of a similar OS named Unix. It's mainly useful for servers, but me being insane, I use it for my desktop computer (in fact, I'm using it right now...) In most regards, it's similar enough to Linux that most people wouldn't even notice a difference. Installing software is easy... you go to the ports directory, locate what you want to install, and type &quot;make install,&quot; and wait for it to finish. Setting things up to use it as a desktop computer is where it becomes a severe pain, though. It took me a couple days to figure out how to install a Flash plugin, for one thing... <br />
 <br />
Well, I think I've rambled on long enough...</div></div><hr />

It may work in Wine, but I doubt it. Probably the best solution if you have to use that program is to dual-boot; i.e., you would run Linux and Windows on the same computer, rebooting into Windows whenever you need to run that program.</div></div><hr />

weel seeing as my current privite computer runs Win98 and it is not listed on the OS it works with.  And I'm sure as hell not paying $87 for XP.....  So I might have to buy a work computer.....</div></div><hr />

There are several other unix-compatible systems that I like, so in conclusion, Linux/X is not something I would pay to use.</div></div><hr />

Other wise I am willing to pay for linux.

<br />
I like FreeBSD too, but until getting simple things working (like Flash, sound, or printing) is less complicated than it currently is, it may not necessarily be the best solution for most people... And don't forget that X Windows also runs on FreeBSD: in fact, I'm running KDE on X Windows in FreeBSD right now. <br />

Who said you have to pay for it? I got all the Linux distributions I have installed on my computer for free. Now, if you have a slow internet connection, downloading might not be an option, but switching from Linux to FreeBSD wouldn't have any effect on that.</div></div><hr />

I run both Slackware and Gentoo. Slackware, as mentioned above, is nice, small, and not a pain to install. I run it on an old laptop, and was the first distro I messed around with. Gentoo, on the other hand, I run on a desktop. I like it for the easy installation of programs, just 'emerge' this or that, and it installs. 'Unmerge', and it's gone. Very customizable installation, as you have to pretty much manually install and set up everything, so it's almost definitely over the head of any new users (although, they provide a nice tutorial on the site).<br />

Right now, though, I'm on a Mac, and I haven't messed around with installing any Linux distro on it, but I may...</div></div><hr />

If it weren't for a few games that just won't run in WineX/Cedega, I would banish MS from my desktop.

<br />
just a question: are you runninng civ3 on WineX? I tried it about a half year ago, but it ran even more sluggish than on Win. But it sure is a cool application.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I still use mostly WinXp for my desktop needs but use linux at school and for my server. as a server os, linux beats windows hands down, IMHO. I mainly use gentoo.</div></div><hr />

Other than some audio glitches, it seems fine.  The Conquests CD protection is a bear, though.  It doesn't *always* see the CD when I run it.  Frustrating.<br />
<br />
I normally run Standard maps, never bigger than Large.  I also use the default number of AI opponents.  I haven't noticed any sluggishness.<br />
<br />
I also don't know if MP works well when using Cedega.  I tend to play Stand-Alone.</div></div><hr />

I never said you have to pay for it. I'm just saying I wouldn't pay; paying is certainly an option :D<br />
<br />
Yeah I know X is the common display system for FreeBSD.<br />
<br />
For true Linux, I liked Corel OS more than other distros, but I forgot the new name of it - another company continued it.. :undecide:<br />
<br />
Sun Solaris is also decent, and available free to software developers :smug:<br />
<br />
So, those would be my choices: FreeBSD, Solaris, CorelOS. I also have AT&amp;T UNIX on floppy disks :crazyeye: -- despite all this, I am not an experienced user.<br />
<br />
I was working on my own *nix compatible OS but it didn't develop beyond design stage. I decided the long-term development needs would be beyond my resources. &quot;If I were a billionaire...&quot; :(</div></div><hr />

Not Xandros? from http://www.xandros.com</div></div><hr />

 Yes, that's them. I don't know what their product is like but CorelOS was discontinued and sold to Xandros.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Except it has a price on it<br />
<br />
Though there is a free version</div></div><hr />
