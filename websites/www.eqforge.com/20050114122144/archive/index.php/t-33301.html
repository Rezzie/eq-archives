<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">penvzila</div><div class="date">Oct 01, 2002, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know this is quasi-flamebait, but i would really appreciate as many opinions as possible.  Should I buy windows XP or 2000, and if XP, is professoinal really that much more valuable than home?  I don't need encryption and all that jazz, but i've heard some pretty horrible thinks like having to call M$ to uninstall.  Just for your information here is my setup:<br />
<br />
Processor:  Athlon XP 2000+<br />
Motherboard:  MicroStar K7T266 Pro2-A (Crappy mobo, I know, but it was hella cheap packaged w/the proc at fry's)<br />
RAM:  512MB MUSHKIN PC2700 333Mhz FSB, 2.5-3-3, will probably buy another 512 or 256 when i get funds.<br />
HDD:  120 Gig Western Digital 'special edition' (better buffer and seek time)<br />
Noname 24x CD-Burner, possible a cheap DVD-ROM drive<br />
Sound:  Turtle Beach Santa Cruz<br />
Gfx: Probably go with the EVGA Gf4 Ti4200 on newegg<br />
<br />
I know that's way more info than you need, but i've heard some wierd things.  BTW, before you say it, yes, i will probably dual boot with Linux, either SuSE (which i already have) or Slackware.<br />
<br />
Thanks to those who give their opinions. shame on the lurkers!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">penvzila</div><div class="date">Oct 01, 2002, 07:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">General apps: games, openoffice, but also music creation software and photoediting on occasion.  I am a student and will be going to college soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mikoyan</div><div class="date">Oct 02, 2002, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2000 is easy on your system, is small in size and rarely crashes. I vote 2K.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 02, 2002, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, same for me. 2K is enough, although maybe less adapted than XP for new games. But well, you can always dual boot with 98 as I do. And actually XP is still a too &quot;young and amature&quot; OS... let's wait a bit for patches...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perfection</div><div class="date">Oct 02, 2002, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah either get 2000 or 98SE,  I got XP and I regret it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smash</div><div class="date">Oct 03, 2002, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Get in on the ground floor.Be a guinea pig<br />
Get XP.<br />
<br />
2 more &quot;patches&quot; this week alone :D<br />
<br />
Its a good thing but take the time to read what each &quot;update&quot; does or can potentially do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kundor</div><div class="date">Oct 03, 2002, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you play a lot of games, I'd go for XP.  I have it, and I like it the best of any M$ OS I've used, though I've never had 2000.  But then, the ONLY thing I use it for is games (Mandrake for all else) so perhaps my opinion as far as other things goes is not worth much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Oct 03, 2002, 10:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the bells and whistles in XP; although, I have been thinking of going back to W2K for the cleaner interface and the less needing of tweaking to get the max speed. I only found one game that I could play in W2K and I am almost sure I could have played it in XP (it was Mech Warrior 3....it reconized W2K as NT, with XP I could have set the compatibility mode to Win98 to get it to work...in theory). Your system sounds like it can handle the extra load that XP demands over W2K without slowing down. Hell, if my Duron 750 can handle it.... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pillager</div><div class="date">Oct 04, 2002, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would vote XP, because it's easier for games. If you don't want its extras go for 2k, but stability wise there's little to choose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mikoyan</div><div class="date">Oct 04, 2002, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can play all my games on 2K with no problems.</div></div><hr />
