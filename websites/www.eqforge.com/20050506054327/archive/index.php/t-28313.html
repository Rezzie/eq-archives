<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kemal</div><div class="date">Jul 29, 2002, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was just getting ready to submit my results for the Game of the month and I have a small question about what is meant with &quot;your final score&quot; as stated in the rules page.<br />
<br />
This is unclear to me because in the last Game of the month I got a fairly early spaceship victory but in the results my score was just the score as listed next to the powergraph on the final turn of the game, not the one multiplied with the early victory and difficulty bonus you get in the game's Hall of Fame.<br />
However, when I looked at some earlier Gotm results I noticed that some (very) early finishes got a very high score in the results list, indicating that the early finish multiplier had been taken in account for measuring the final (gotm) score.<br />
<br />
So what I like to know is:<br />
<br />
Does &quot;final score&quot; mean the score you get in your game's Hall of fame (difficulty and early finish multipliers included) or the score that is stated next to the powergraph on the final turn of your game (without additional bonuses)? Or does this depend on the type of victory with which you have completed the game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Surely the final score means your score in the hall-of-fame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps I can rise a couple of places in the Global ranking now :)</div></div><hr />
