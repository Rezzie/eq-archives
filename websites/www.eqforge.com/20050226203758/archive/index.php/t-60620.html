<br />
Tlaxcala prevents us from connecting Africa and Woodstock with railroad and geographically it also belongs to us. We should immediately try to get the Aztecs to declare war and then capture Tlaxcala, regardless of whether we decide to totally eliminate the Aztecs now or not.<br />
<br />
Blenheim Palace: SE (IRB now !!), SM, CH. Needs irrigation/farmland, maybe build engineer ?<br />
Electrical: Engineer, MP, aqueduct. Build railroad towards Tlaxcala now.<br />
Superstorms: Rehome cavalry in Rhodes. IRB cavalry now to help capture Tlaxcala. Then build aqueduct and bank. Bribe the Aztec caravan and send it to Doughnutia.<br />
Tlaxcala (!): I'm assuming we capture this city. Harbor, temple, aqueduct, MP, depending on which of these improvements are there. Maybe engineers.<br />
<br />
The biggest news here is Tlaxcala. The Ministry of Domestic Affairs sees this city as a major obstacle to its railroad plans and strongly recommends capturing this city immediately if we can get the Aztecs to declare war.<br />
<br />
Comments please, especially Tlaxcala-related :D.</div></div><hr />

Not too big an issue to get them to fight.<br />
<br />
It was in the initial war plan to jump on Tlaxcala at the start anyway, so also not a big headache.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Aug 05, 2003, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tlaxcala would be good, and Ten would also be pretty easy to capture. Since Tlax is so isolated (it's practically closer to us allready:D ), Ten is a good place to get a foothold in their empire. We should road (Railroad?) to Tlax from Woodstock first, then send in cavalry to capture it. Ten could be emptied by the destroyer outside Thessalonica and captured by the same cavlries and galleon taking Tours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Aug 05, 2003, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All of these Stock Exchanges, I'm not so sure.  We are at merely 20% Luxury now, and a bump to 30% would create a huge round of Celebrations.<br />
<br />
Blenheim: Why Court or SE?  It already has a Bank and Sewer.  Either ignore it and let it build the Court, or Switch now to Engr or Van, or IPRB $136 and let it slowly build the SE.  Supermarket seems wasteful.<br />
Electrical: Engr in 1, E Irrg plains, build Market, agreed.<br />
Superstorms: rehome Cav in Rhodes, IPRB $25 Alpine in 1, see Tlaxcala plan below.  Sell either PortFac or Barx?  Not sure about Aquaduct, maybe Bank first, or rather more military for Aztec war.<br />
Perhaps build a Mined Hill City by moving the 2 Engr NE NE to get the Whale and one Green, use Elect Engr to found city, then support ships or military built by Superstorms.<br />
Tlaxcala related.  Why not use SS $25 to build an Alpine in 1, and buy Tlaxcala with a Dip?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Aug 05, 2003, 10:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are not allowed to bribe cities (only units), otherwise we would simply buy the world ;).<br />
<br />
The idea behind the stock exchanges and courthouses is that the plan is to switch to democracy a few turns from now and start celebrations that should last a long time since lots of cities will have many improvements necessary to celebrate for possibly about 10 turns (I'm hoping to get many size 25+ cities as a result of the celebrations).<br />
<br />
We could have started celebrating earlier but combining the building of infrastructure in the core cities (plus big cities in our colonies), a fundamentalist government and warfare seemed like a good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Aug 05, 2003, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, then Superstorms $25 $25 Cav in 1, then maybe Bank before Aquaduct, depends on the eventual Lux%<br />
<br />
I still think Alpines are great way to stake out the border.</div></div><hr />
