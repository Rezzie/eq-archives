I would like a concession to be allowed to do so (to defend the image of all Australians), because there is a Tripa, (not mentioning any names) constantly bagging CivII with his delusions that Call to Puke &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/cwm8.gif&quot; border=0&gt; is better.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have calculated this idiots intellect to the third bead on my abacus, and I am dismayed by what I see &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/frown.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
I would just like to announce that not all Australians are as pathetically damaged in the brain as some Tripa's appear to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would not like to mention the persons name because I do not wish to be incriminating, but you know who you are and you are definitely a TRIPA!<br />
<br />
Please refrain from being a moron here in this forum or any other for that matter because you are just giving our beautiful country a bad name!<br />
<br />
MrLeN<br />
<br />
P.S. Get a life... CTP isn't even in the same league as CivII. Furthermore, it is merely a bad, bug ridden, half finished, never to be completed, abandoned by Activision, no more patch CLONE!!!<br />

I am just speaking the truth. <br />

It just sucks a bit. It's a little harsh to condemn it as a piece of crap, because it's not. It just has a few flaws in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrLeN</div><div class="date">Mar 01, 2001, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes Vlad, of course. You are entirely correct, and I was of the same opinion until...<br />
<br />
Activision confirmed with an *'official statement' to the Civ community that they do not wish to tend to the problems because they have other things to do!<br />
<br />
THAT is when the game was stamped as CRAP!<br />
<br />
And CRAP is exactly what it is!<br />
