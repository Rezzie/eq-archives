Is anyone invading them?  They're such a backward people, I thought it might be beneficial to grab their resources, before they establish contact with everyone else.  Especially when you only get a pathetic 2 luxuries at home (but hey, 7 Ivory man, gotta love that Ivory...).<br />
<br />
I'm at 550ad here and just about to coup-de-grace the Romans, because his cities are too close to my Forbidden Palace.  Gunpowder &amp; astronomy have just been researched.  It just looks to me like the sad Aztecs are the next target, but...maybe I'm the only one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Airness</div><div class="date">Dec 06, 2001, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took a chance sending 2 galleys with 2 horseman each up north, 1 made it to the Aztec without sinking!!!<br />
<br />
I took 1 city quickly by a surprise landing attack.  The Aztecs did not seem to know I only had 2 horses on her entire island! And she seemed to be scared of my 20 horses and 10 hoplites stationed on my main land, and quickly settled for peace.  In the first negotiation, I tricked her to exchange 4 of her cities with 5 of my small cities on my main land, and of cause I took those 5 cities right after the deal :D <br />
<br />
Quickly I build 4 libraries on her island and pretty much grab all the land there from then.<br />
<br />
She had no where to expand, so she declare war on me, and by then i had troops on her island and quickly the war ended, and i got another city from her for free.  Cool thing is i got a leader out of that little skirmish and build the Great Light house with it ...<br />
<br />
Not bad so far.<br />
<br />
So just take one city, and my evil deplo took care the rest :goodjob: <br />

Whenever things got tense I knew the Aztecs would sign MPP with me for free and thus help keep others in check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mr. Socks</div><div class="date">Dec 06, 2001, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'm probably the only guy who ended up attacking the Aztecs instead of the Romans (well, mostly).  Read my account in the spoiler thread if you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taé Shala</div><div class="date">Dec 07, 2001, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried it a while ago. I took the silk and made peace. My goal is to get a diplo-vic so I needed the silk for me and my &quot;brothers&quot;. But I didn´t destroy the aztecs at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stealth_B2</div><div class="date">Dec 07, 2001, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since the Romans had established a monopoly on all of the horses and since they rushed a settler to &quot;my&quot; iron (about 5 turns before my settler could get there), i felt it necessary to attack them early, for i had no intention of building a fine &quot;ALL ARCHER&quot; army.  The iron city they created was on a hill, so i knew i needed some pretty heavy firepower to eventually take that one out.  Building about 4 archers, i attacked a horse city (had a road to it the very next turn), then began building lots of horse to sweep everything else.  Originally i thought i would take the iron city as an early priority to introduce the Swordsman element, but decided instead to stick with the horse and embrace their speed, retreatability and their eventual, but decidedly imminent upgradability to the Mighty Knight.  Swept thru Rome and ended up taking the iron city last, about the same time i was trading for Chivaly with the newly discovered new World.  <br />
<br />
At this point i have a big island all to myself , the Lighthouse, 50 vet or elite horse, a new patch of iron, 3500 gold and a dozen Galleys.  Since London has something i very much want (Pyramids) and their culture is a bit weaker than mine, it is predicted that 50-70 knights will storm the British shores within about 7 turns.<br />
<br />
To answer the question about  the Aztecs,,,,,,,,, their fate is sealed, but i expect to take them out last :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tetley</div><div class="date">Dec 07, 2001, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do you want the Pyramids?  Doesn't it benefit only its own continent?  Are you planning on owning a lot of cities on Pangaea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smash</div><div class="date">Dec 07, 2001, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought about it but a bunch of corrupt cities producing 1 sheild didn't seem worth the effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stealth_B2</div><div class="date">Dec 07, 2001, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're right Tetley that Pyramids only benefit the continent upon which they sit, but i intend to have many, many cities in the new world...  which i like to refer to as my &quot;colony&quot;.  Maybe i'm still bitter too, that London got pyramids before me and the 330 shields i had towards them had to be applied to a &quot;settler&quot; :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mad Dog</div><div class="date">Dec 07, 2001, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I took the aztecs out quite late, probably 1200s or so. I waiting until I got cavalry. Cavalry are such great blitkrieg troops - with their fast movement they can hit enemy cities and resources fast without having to spend time exposed in the open.The great movement also makes it easy to take out enemies that get behind your lines. I had a brief moment of irritation when they produced a couple of cavalry, before I sat on their saltpeter, and that was that. I didn't *need* to take them out, but hey, they had those nice silks.<br />
<br />
If u want to take the aztecs out &quot;honestly&quot; (ie not using city trading 'sploits or pure despot rushing) then waiting for cavalry then upgrading all those slacking horseman you have kicking around is pretty effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smash</div><div class="date">Dec 08, 2001, 04:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading more..I couldn't resist.:)<br />
Late 1100s..a large armada of 15 ironclads left Greece accompanied by a huge flotilla of 30+ galleons loaded with infantry,cavalry and artillery.Well over 100 units.3 turns later, it was over.<br />
Its getting out of hand.I now have somewhere around 400 units.<br />
<br />
STILL NOT 1 LEADER!!!...I dunno..I've got a bunch of elites.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Dec 09, 2001, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mwahaha. Science is up to 90%, I get about 250 gold from the AI per turn, and a second attack will start soon, with my caravels filled with cavalry and knights. In Tenochtitlan I will build my Forbidden City, which I have saved (or actually just didn't come around to).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tetley</div><div class="date">Dec 10, 2001, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tenochtitlan's a nice place to build the Forbidden.  Lots and lots of gold.   I think building west of Rome is better, though.  Lots of river-cities down there.  .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tetley</div><div class="date">Dec 12, 2001, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh man, I'm SO glad that I invaded the Aztecs!!  Even more so now that I've researched Refining.  Need I say more?   :)</div></div><hr />
