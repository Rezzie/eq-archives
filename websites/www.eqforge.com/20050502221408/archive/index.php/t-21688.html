Since it's multiplayer, it could be that there's a set game that you jump in with 7 other players, and that the results of the &quot;scenario&quot; can then be posted so you see how you did against other groups of 8 people with the same map and starting position.<br />
<br />
Or it could be that you submit your turns to a centralized system that then runs all the turns simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Imagine that!  MPGotM!  Can you imagine taking your turn, and seeing something that says that &quot;in game #2056, the average score for your civ, the Iroquois, by 1 AD was 587.2&quot;...<br />

Yeah, that would be a awesome concept for MP. <br />
<br />
But, I don't expect anything good from this XP. So there is less chance that I will be desappointed.</div></div><hr />

Being that your finally score will be exteremely related by who you played against, a GOTM would be hard to do based on scores.<br />
<br />
Of course a system similar to chess ratings could be developed as well.</div></div><hr />

It would be nice to get back into that, haven't played in one since MechCommander. If one does start up, I am definatly going to have to invest in a better ISP.</div></div><hr />

As long as I get credit for it. :D</div></div><hr />

If it's good, I don't mind closing our GOTM feature, but this GOTM forum will always remain open. :)</div></div><hr />

Not everyone can hook up for MP games and devote the amount of time required. It would be a great loss if you end up closing down the GOTM based on an XP pack. Hey, in Civ2 you had MP games but you still kept up a GOTM.  ;)<br />
<br />
I for one appreciate your efforts. Now if only I could get as balanced a random game that you can generate. You must be the one with the real luck!! :goodjob: <br />

<br />
How do Game of the Day (GOTD) and Game of the Week (GOTW) work? Are they similar to CivFanatics' GOTM feature? <br />
<br />
Not sure what you're talking about here. There isn't any built in support for these types of tourneys, beyond what we've already released (no mods to scenario once the game starts, etc).</div></div><hr />
