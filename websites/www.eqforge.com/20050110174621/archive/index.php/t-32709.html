It's lighter than trillian and it's also compatible with icq, msn, yahoo etc... (and also that suck thing from AOL...). Have a look. 500kB only. Free of course, contrary to trilian pro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CornMaster</div><div class="date">Sep 24, 2002, 08:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I looked at it.<br />
<br />
Trillian Free has way more features.  And Pro...a ton more.  Nice try GK.<br />
<br />
But Trillian is still king. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Sep 24, 2002, 08:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But it's much heavier... several megs :p<br />
This is lighter I said. Anyway I don't use any of those all in one IM so... it was just a FYI :)</div></div><hr />

And yes I there's already a better product: MSN alone ;) ICQ and the other IM suck hard. Plus Trillian pro is no more free... and since I never pirate...</div></div><hr />

I think you have a typo...it should read and since I never not  pirate...</div></div><hr />

Did I ever dare doing such an evil thing in my life? Tssk, piracy is definitely not my hobby! And your postmen won't deny that ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Sep 27, 2002, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">MSN alone? have you fallen out of the stupid tree and hit every limb on the way down?!?!?! ;)<br />
<br />
So what if the pro version isn't free....you can still get the regular version for free and it is the best multi-IM client out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, that explains the fairly large ROM section displayed on your computer a while back when you uploaded a screenshot of your computer when you filled up your HDD :D<br />
<br />
easymessage isn't too bad but I'd rather just spend the extra few mins and download trillian. Msn alone is just garbage compared to having all of the IM services combined.<br />
<br />
Here's a ranking system:<br />
<br />
1) Trillian(although I'm usually too lazy to load it unless I wanna talk to someone not on AOLIM which autoloads)<br />
2) Easymessage(woopie!)<br />
3214) Msn(BOOOOOOOOO!!!!)<br />
<br />
<br />
What the heck is a mac user doing using only msn!?!?!?!?!?!? :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
And btw, glad to see you put easy message before ICNothing :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Sep 29, 2002, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, found those too:<br />

You didn't actually TRY any of those programs you recommended did you?<br />
<br />
Well I reviewed 8 in all.<br />
<br />
Only 1 besides Trillian got more then 8 out of 10.<br />
<br />
4 Others scored BELOW 5/10.  Which basically means they didn't work.<br />
<br />
Be careful before you recommend programs in the future. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 21, 2002, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol, you know what? just tried them out ALL this afternoon, no kidding! You and I are really well coordinated :)<br />
No kidding, I tested them all today, since I couldn't get MSN to work through my corporate firewall. Nevertheless, easy message worked! but it disconnected too regularly. Finally I kept imici and indiatimes messenger. Exit maxxim, , integrity messenger, and devil chat... And some more ones I forgot the names. Well I guess I really polluted badly my registry today (of my office NT4 pc) installing and uninstalling all those things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CornMaster</div><div class="date">Oct 21, 2002, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You got the Indiatimes messenger to work!<br />
<br />
It got a 0. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Silverblade</div><div class="date">Oct 27, 2002, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theres no big problems with Trillian, I like that program. ICQ I hated beacause of the ads. Have now been useing Trillian quite some long time now. I can never go back to ICQ now.<br />
<br />
That Trillian is big, well it's smaller than ICQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kundor</div><div class="date">Oct 30, 2002, 10:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's gaim for windows.....<br />
http://gaim.sourceforge.net/<br />
<br />
I use Gaim in linux and trillian in windows, so I've never seen how gaim for windows works, but it's great in linux....supports more protocols than trillian does too (though via plugins.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy76</div><div class="date">Oct 30, 2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Trillian is going the plugin route also, now. I have a co-worker that uses GAIM for windows. It doesn't look as snazy as Trillian .74 or Pro 1.0 but it supposedly work pretty well, and like kundor said, it supports more protocols.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Nov 04, 2002, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ahaha! Powerful, really too powerful (http://www.eyeball.com). Check it. Eyeball chat. I'm now using it a lot, since it has a really nice video conferencing option, that doesn't take too much bandwith, but with an excellent quality video/voice. Plus of course it's interoperable Yahoo, MSN, AIM etc.... That one I tested for several days before recommending it. Very nice. So if anyone wants to see my drunk face ;)...</div></div><hr />
