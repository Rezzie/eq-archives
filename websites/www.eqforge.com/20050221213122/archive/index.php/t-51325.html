Recommended is to found new city NE of western whale, road with other settler and start a caravan in EF for the wonder in Neumatic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Apr 23, 2003, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool poll, funxus :cool:<br />
<br />
AB5: RF Settler founds city 5SW of Neu, per Blissful_Zen.<br />
 This is safer (closer) than NE of western whale.<br />
B: RF Sett (S of RF) to Road Buffalo and begin to use that?<br />
 (Duke: I didn't realize this was an option, forgot to check it!,<br />
 &amp;nbsp; I was careful to NOT vote for any of the A's,<br />
 &amp;nbsp; and didn't realize there were TWO RF Settlers - duh)<br />
D: RF continue Caravan, consider Buffalo production.<br />
E: LC Temple, consider using Silk now.<br />
F: Build Settler after Warrior, go Irrigate Neumatic Swamp.<br />
<br />
G: Send Neu Phx to LC seems prudent.<br />
I: IPRB $8 RF now, IPRB $8 Naervana !  Spend spend spend :scan:<br />
J: Consider RB Dough $56 Temple, release Ellie, start Phx and IPRB $11, then start Wonder?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone voting now, please consider Gary's options G I J (Don't know why H is missing:confused: )<br />
<br />
IPRBing and RBing maybe should wait until the barbs are gone in case we need the money. Depends on what the MA decides to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2003, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If we plan to bribe barb Archer, it would seem pointless to send Neumatic's Phalanx there, unless we think there is a resonable chance our bribing plan will fail.  Spending is fine, but first priority for spending is the barb plan, IMHO.  Once barbs are taken care of we can IPRB elsewhere.  I'd hate to rush a dip and then not have enough money to buy the Archer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't vote for any of the A's because I want a city on the grassland square 5 squares SW of Neumatic but if I understood the poll correctly that was not an option, only the forest square S of it. It may be dangerous to found a city near the western whale because of barbarians, also it might be more useful to create a 'barbarian trap' in that area.<br />
<br />
We shouldn't rush buy anything except a diplomat in LC. Moving a phalanx there doesn't make sense to me since it will arrive there too late to prevent the barbarians from attacking and reducing LC's size by one (it's very important to prevent this). I posted a more detailed message on this problem in the 925BC thread (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=51202); I' not going to repeat it here but in summary: We should rush buy a diplomat to use for bribing one of the barbarian archers and also taxes must be set to maximum.<br />
<br />
EDIT: We should consider building road on the buffalo near RF before building a road from RF to LP. Doughnutia should rush buy its temple ASAP after the barbarian problem is solved and then start a wonder.</div></div><hr />

It seems to me we'll have just enough $$ to incrementally rush buy a diplomat in LC and then bribe the archer if we set taxes to maximum and maximize trade in all cities. In the unfourtunate event that I'm wrong we'd have to sell RF's temple which is not as bad as it sounds; RF isn't nearly as important to develop as LC, Neu and Dough because its location isn't very good (and this even though it is our capital).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2003, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems as if most people want to found city north of whale and road between RF and LP.<br />
<br />
I agree we could road a dead-end to the buffalo before proceeding to LP, to aid RF.<br />
<br />
The reason I chose the forest instead of the GL was that it had least overlapping, which I'm not really very fond of. Now that I look at it, I see that your spot probably is better since we can work two more land-squares, and only one more overlapping square (and none two Neu or Dou). So sure, if we found a city in that area, the grassland is probably better than the forest.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blissful_Zen</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2003, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didnt vote for A either the S RF settler i think should go to that spot 5sw of Neu. (thanx gary)  The N RF  settler i think should continue building roads, and increasing trade.  I like G and I   options, (I) is best choice if u ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2003, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted to road to LP, but also highly recommend roading the buffalo if it is being used on it's way.  Increasing Trade is more important than connecting cities at the moment (and probably in general)</div></div><hr />
