My registry is very dirty after installations/uninstallations of many programs, and some wrong ones, and some pirate ones etc etc... I want to clean up my reggy. Is there a program that detects almost all unused registry entires or bad ones and delets them?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
I am not sure about it myself. Haven't used it  in 2 years... :)<br />

This free RegClean program from Microsoft appears to be very popular... Don't know if it works for Win2k or Win XP though...<br />

<br />
It runs on both Win9x and NTx systems, and handles the NT Hive correctly.  It can also backy up and restore an entire registry.<br />
<br />

It is fast and stable.</div></div><hr />

It will work on NTx registries, but it does not do a great deal.  It is very conservative, and will not compact or repair a registry.  But, unlike most MS products, it won't harm it either (very very remote chance of harm,anyway) :) .</div></div><hr />

I only started with Fix-It 3.0, so I'm not sure about prior versions.  They improved significantly from 3.0 to 4.0, and I like that is runs well on both W9x and NTx systems.  It does a lot more than just the menu that I posted above, too.... and I'm pretty picky with Utilities :).  I definitely recommend it for casual or average users, and it is good for &quot;experts&quot;, too.  Norton has been catching up on some techincal things, though.<br />

<br />
I assume you are talking about the MS WinME on your machine:  It is an OEM version, right?  If so, using the code is supposed to unlock and allow the install.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I was unable to clean up the regurate mess MS make of my computer have to do than full install of WindowME . <br />
<br />
<br />
I am not sure I understand what you are saying, but I think you are saying that your Registry is a mess, and that the only way to clean up the mess it to do a full install of WinME.<br />
<br />
If you WinME will boot, then you probably have nothing to lose by trying FixIt 4.0 or even Norton Utilities 2002.  Use their repair options for the registry.<br />
<br />
When you reinstall (or fix teh problem), you should back up your registry before installing any new program, and also back it up every week or to.  That way you can revert back to a &quot;Last Known Good&quot; registry if something bad happens.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you know of<br />
than program or than way to use than hex editor to change the ending year with patch 1.21f <br />
<br />
I am confused about what you ask.  Does the &quot;ending year&quot; refer to the OEM code,  or  a Registry entry, or are you talking about a .SAV from Civ 3?  Your sudden referral to path 1.21f looks like the Civ 3 patch to me, not a WinME patch.<br />
<br />
I do not have CIv 3 installled on my computer, and do not know about editing it with a hex editor.   You might ask in the Civ 3 Tech Support forum, here. (http://forums.civfanatics.com/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=48) <br />
<br />
You might check the downloads section of Civ 3 to see if they have a utility that might help with whatever you are trying to do with Civ 3.<br />

I try to use ontrack to clean up the mess. Microsoft office suite doesnot regurate in your window as office suite but as thousands of OS register entry so you can  tell one from the order. It got so back I have to do than full windowsme install. I disable autoupgrade on my system as everytime  I install their upgrade my computer doesnot work as <br />
well I have autogradeup off for two month now with no plloblem now.<br />
   What I meant Bush remark is supid as there is no simple answer to the terrorist plobem.  Let say we prove that Russia and Red China are useing terrorist to attack use in America but our proof is fault as it is base upton Israel intelligent and their want use to attack Russia and Red China. We attack Russia and Red China with missiles and planes. They defence thenself and shoot down some of our planes and missiles. The whole thing can get out of control and pettry soon nuke are flying toward their targets. There is no anti-missiles system that can protect against than full scale attack of thousands of missile at ounce. It like  those Hollywood moive that nuclear missile stop than big rock<br />
from space from hitting Earth. In real life those rock are traveling at between <br />
50 and 100 miles/second. Let say our radar pick it up when it is 1000 miles away from Earth that mean we have 10 seconds to decide what to do and reprogran every nuclear missiles on earth  to hit the rock and ICBM can only<br />
travel 100 to 150 miles above the Earth at most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahhh.... Ok, so you solved teh problem by turning autoupgrade off.  I also do that for all software.  The ONLY way I will install or upgrade software is if I can download all of it first, and look at it, and scan for viruses, etc.<br />
<br />
Just 5 days ago,MS had to admit that it infected all Korean MS software (dealing with Visual Studio) with a virus.  I do not trust any company.  And some Microsoft software is a Trojan Horse... they install stuff that is activated by special Registry settings.  I hunt those down and cut them out with a vengence. :hammer:  Or I don't use the software.  :hammer:   Other companies do this, too... it is user beware, esp. if you are in a corporate or military environment.<br />
<br />
Your software key should work.  MS may have disabled the authentication at their central server, and you must call Microsoft  (or the OEM, or both) and get a new code.  A hacker likely got a hold of your code, and they deactivated it.  :eek:</div></div><hr />

realy donot need works. I have to manual delete the work files as there was no add/remove  listing in the add/remove to use. Most computer games are alot better about this as they want to keep custmor.  I hear that MS is loseing about 1/3 of their custmor<br />
in the corporate sector. If GM want to not use MS their can go with IBM  Limun Mainframes, Apple Computer or Sun OS, or Unix OS. When I need than new computer if will mostly likely be not<br />

   Israel and India in my option engauge in State Terroristism against the people of occuporate  land and I  E- Mail the Secretary of State to add Israel and India to the list of seven Terrorist State.<br />
    In the example of than big rock hitting Earth it wouldnot matter if the missile where fire or not fire as it take between 10 and 15 minutes for ICBM and Medium range missiles reach they maxium height anyway. Medium range missile noromal; donot travel in space but can reach space if it sacife range for height.</div></div><hr />

I mentioned that in the &quot;Freeware that rocks!&quot; thread.<br />
<br />
IMHO Fix-It's registry fixer (which found almost a thousand invalid links in my registry the first time I ran it:)) is outstanding but RegCleaner is really good for a free program.</div></div><hr />

If you re-format/reinstall Windows XP, does it still know it's the same computer, or do you have to call MS to reactivate it? (This is the only reason why I haven't re-formatted since I got XP)</div></div><hr />

(This is the only reason why I haven't re-formatted since I got XP) It would be the same system hardware so when it did the product activation over the internet you SHOULD NOT have a problem.</div></div><hr />

Then it will probably wait until you are connected and keep asking you to activate it. MS never gives up.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't want to upgrade at first, either, but really, that product activation is no big deal. If you have a legal copy of XP, you'll be fine. At least XP (and any other OS) is way better than WinME, which is a good reason to upgrade.:)</div></div><hr />
