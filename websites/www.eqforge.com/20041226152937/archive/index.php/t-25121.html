Come in a recommend a system to people. Determine what type of person it will go for (SOHO, Bleeding Edge gamer, Money bags Gamer, Lean Gamer, Server, etc.) and post what equipment they should get. It is also good to tell what the cost of the system would be, by part, that way they can subsititute parts and easily know what the cost difference will be. Read my next post for an example.</div></div><hr />

TF, please move this to Computer Talk, thanks!<br />

edit: I know what happened. When TF changed the name of the forum it move the location of the forum in my User CP. It used to be under the Site Feedback forum but is now above it. I click on the lowest Link in my CP and didn't even check to make sure it was the correct forum. :shame:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2002, 05:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went down to my local computer store here in SLC (TAC (http://www.totallyawesome.com)) to find the ultimate PC the have up for sale.  They call it the Ridiculously Insane Intel Model:<br />
<br />
Casedge Mid-tower case / 300 watt ATX power supply<br />
ASUS P4T-E Motherboard AGP 4x / 400 MHz bus<br />
2.2 GHz Intel Pentium 4 CPU<br />
512 MB RDRAM (PC 800)<br />
Dual 40 Gigabyte IBM 7200 RPM Ultra ATA/100 with Promise Fastrack 100 RAID controller card<br />
Toshiba 16x/40x CD/DVD ROM<br />

Creative Labs Sound Blaster Audigy Platinum sound card<br />
U.S. Robotics 56K v.90 modem<br />
18&quot; NEC LCD 1850E TFT monitor<br />
Klipsch Promedia 5.1 channel home theatre sound system<br />
Logitech Internet Keyboard / Logitech Optical mouse<br />
Windows XP<br />
And since it's an actual company, three years parts and hardware warranty with lifetime free service and support.<br />
<br />
Simply an unbelievable system, one that will blast through any program you run.  If you have $3300 to spend, settle for nothing less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2002, 04:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is Blue that a person could put that together themself and get it for half the price. No free tech support? That is what this forum is for!!! :D No warranty? Most of the parts, even OEM, come with a little bit of a warranty and most parts do not go bad. The only product I had a problem with in the last 2+ years has been a hard drive. I called up Maxtor and got another. Didn't cost me a thing.....not even a phone call (800 number) or shipping (prepaid to send it back by Maxtor). So I would have pocketed over $1600 versus that company's price. I figure it is worth it for people to build there own. Hell, I am sure they have a friend that would love to help them make it and would probably do all the work because us computer geeks just love to build new systems.<br />
<br />
Custom all the way!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArmOrAttAk</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2002, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, I recommend pricewatch.com for computer parts. I compared a few prices to that newegg.com and they are generally cheaper. That video card was a few bucks more but hard drive, and cpu cheaper.<br />
I also recommend EBay, just check the sellers feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2002, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All right, PH.  I was just trying to list out the supreme system of the hour from my most trusted source for Personal Computers, but since you want me to give a custom built price here goes.  All prices taken from http://www.pricewatch.com (when a pricewatch price is unavailable):<br />
<br />
<br />
Casedge Mid Tower case with 300 watt power supply:  $40<br />
ASUS P4T-E motherboard / 400 MHz bus: $60<br />
2.2 GHz Intel Pentium IV CPU:  $234<br />
512 MB RDRAM (PC 800):  $202<br />
Dual 40 GIG 7200 RPM IBM hard drives: $160 ($80 each)<br />
Fastrack Promise RAID controller:  $245 <br />
CD/DVD ROM 16x40x:  $35<br />
40x12x40: $105 (with Nero Burning ROM :))<br />
128 MB DDR SDRAM GeForce 4 ti 4600:  $290<br />
Sound Blaster Audigy Platinum:  $170<br />
56K v.90 modem: $12<br />
18&quot; LCD TFT Monitor: $650 (holy s***, that's expensive even at the extremely discounted pricewatch price)<br />
Klipsch Promedia 5.1 channel home theatre system:  $360 <br />
Logitech Intenet Keyboard:  $20<br />
Logitech Optical Mouse:  $70 for the wireless<br />
Windows XP:  $100<br />
<br />
Total system price:  $2753 (plus whatever shipping costs you incur)<br />
<br />
And that's with most of the prices being the very discounted pricewatch prices, typical retail prices would add a lot more money.  I'd say that $3300 from a manufacturer for this system professionally built would not be a bad price at all.</div></div><hr />

It's not good to buy the cheapest, the best is to buy at the local store with the seller you know and familiar with, and trust.<br />

Could cost extra bucks, but could save hell lot of headaches and wasted money.</div></div><hr />

I very much agree.  I would rather get all my junk from my boys down the street at TAC or LsMicro than fork over 2700 dollars via the internet to some po-dunk dealer I've never heard of then wait two months for the thing to get shipped.  If I get cheated, I get pretty screwed, but with my local boys if they try to cheat me (which they never have and never will) my ass is down there straightaway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArmOrAttAk</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2002, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, you're right but I wasn't saying to wire your money to any schmuck on the internet who says he has a great deal. I've bought lots of computer parts over the internet. You just need to be careful. Just because the boys live down the street doesn't mean they're not po-dunks whatever that means heh. Ideally you look for a company there that's close to you. All of my parts arrived within 3 days, so I don't know where you get 2 months... Finally when you pay with a credit card you are protected as far as I know. Never had a problem where I needed to use that feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceBlaZe</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2002, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would rather support the local shop in the city, that is owned by the seller i know, and their computer techinician is the husband of my dad's assitant and all, rather than pay for an unknown internet shop to save a few dollars or more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will agree that pricewatch.com can bring up some unrelyable shops but that is why you go by word of mouth and do research on the shops you are buying from. <br />
<br />
@ArmOrAttAk: <br />
I have heard of people having to wait an obscene amount of time to get their parts from some online dealers. Buyer beware and do your reasearch! :) I haven't had a horrible experience yet, but I don't use some vendors b/c of lousy customer service. NewEgg.com seems pretty good though: Great prices and they receive great ratings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chiefpaco</div><div class="date">Aug 26, 2002, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in the market for a new PC.  My folks live in a small town where the prices are ridiculous.  They don't want any hassles, so they are buying my computer and then I can buy one from the stores in my (bigger) city.  Unfortunately, this limits me to a budget (cause they actually want to save money), but at least I can make some gains.<br />
<br />
My system now:<br />
1GHz Athlon, ASUS A7V133 MB, 256 MB SRAM, 40GB HD, Leadtek GForce2MX 400, SBLive Value, etc...<br />
<br />
New system I am considering from a local shop (sticking to about a $1000 budget):<br />
AMD Duron 1300 MHz Processor<br />
AMD Authorized Heatsink/Fan<br />
ECS K7S5A DDR SocketA Mainboard<br />
256 MB PC2100 DDR Memory<br />
40.5 GB 7200RPM ATA133 Hard Disk Drive<br />
LG 52x CDROM<br />
Panasonic 1.44MB Floppy Disk Drive<br />
MSI GF2 MX400 64MB AGP Video Card<br />
10/100 Network Interface Card<br />
Conexant 56K v.90 Modem<br />
AC97 PCI Sound<br />
140 Watt Amplified Speakers<br />
Aopen PS2 Scroll Mouse<br />
Aopen PS2 Win98 Keyboard<br />
ATX Mid Tower Case<br />
Antec SMART 300 Watt Power Supply<br />
17&quot; Samsung 753DF Monitor<br />
Cost: $924 Cdn + Tax (about $600 USD)<br />
<br />
I'd drop the Modem cause I only need a cable modem connection.<br />
<br />
A few questions:<br />
How would this system compare to my 1GHz Athlon?  Would the Duron 1300 + DDR memory serve me as well?  Should I seek an Athlon XP chip instead?  How do I know if I can just substitute the Duron for the Athlon XP?<br />
<br />
Any complaints with these parts?  How is the ECS SIS chipset with AMD?  How are the MSI video cards?  I am thinking about going for a MX 440... but there are always upgrades I want...<br />
<br />
I use tomshardware site and sharkyextreme for help in system and parts recommendations.  Anyone else have more good sites?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

Fastrack Promise RAID controller:  $245 <br />

<br />
With only 2 hard drives why would you want to set to RAID?  And let's say you really had to do it (totally not needed for gaming), get a board with it built in.  Soyo has some great boards with onboard RAID.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.  Save you some cash (if you where actually building this)</div></div><hr />
