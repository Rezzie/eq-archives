I always thought that it's the case-fan, so I started looking for one of these silent-cases.<br />
<br />
But when I opened it again last week, I realized that it's the processor-fan (I just bought the cheapest available) which is making most of the noise. So I decided on replacing it.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know a good (and of course silent) processor fan? I got a Athlon 1GHz-Processor (Socket A)</div></div><hr />

Of course, if you want to have complete silence, use a water cooling system or even more.<br />

Thanks for the advice, I'll look for a pabst-fan. Of course, a water cooling system is out of the question since I haven't unlimited funds to burn ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
How much does a good water cooling system costs? <br />
And is it possible to buy a water cooling system or have to be build by self?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jun 23, 2002, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, you can build it yourself, but I wouldn´t advise you to. There are even some self-build packs out there, but I´d rather not trust one´s own abilities too much. :eek:<br />
<br />
There are a few smaller companies around selling a water-cooling system, for not too much (~50-200€ in Germany). Just make a web search in your country.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erix</div><div class="date">Jun 23, 2002, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks. I'll search for it. :)</div></div><hr />
