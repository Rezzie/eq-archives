<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 02, 2002, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you know which version of 1.17f you are playing on?  There were 2 different civ3mod.bic files released with 1.17f.  The first version has extra units tagged as available to a barbarian cheifdom in the editor.  This allows Armies from huts, and extra Settlers.  <br />
<br />
In my experience with 1.17f huts (second version of the .bic) it isn't possible to get a settler on 4000BC, or more than one in a game from huts.  This includes a test map where I opened 150 huts on the first turn, and well over 1000 overall.<br />
<br />
In a game I played with the first version of the .bic file, I was able to get 6 settlers out of ~50 huts.  Needless to say this can unbalance the game.<br />
<br />
How to Check:<br />
<br />
Open up civ3mod.bic in the editor.<br />
<br />
Ctrl-R to edit the rules.<br />
<br />
Click on the &quot;Units&quot; tab of the window that pops up.  The first unit shown should be a Settler.<br />
<br />
At the bottom, near the center, there is a list box &quot;Available to&quot;.  See if &quot;A Barbarian Chiefdom&quot; is selected along with all the others.<br />
<br />
If it is selected, you have the first version of the civ3mod.bic file.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is the second &quot;fixed&quot; version of the 1.17f civ3mod.bic for those who don't have it.</div></div><hr />

If I unselect 'A Barabrian Chiefdom' will that make all the changes made in the 2nd one?? or do I have to reinstall the patch again??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kundor</div><div class="date">Apr 02, 2002, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just download the bic in aeson's post and put it in your civ3 folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 02, 2002, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know if there are any other differences in the .bic files.  If you download the attachment in my first post, it contains the updated .bic file.  All the other files in the two 1.17f versions are the same as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Black Fluffy Lion</div><div class="date">Apr 03, 2002, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">updated, thanks Aeson</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 03, 2002, 05:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't know there were two different versions of v1.17f. :o Why haven't they called it v1.17g, or v1.17f2 then?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I strongly suggest to use the second version with the same standard reason: the first one has things that weren't ment to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tioga Joe</div><div class="date">Apr 03, 2002, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what do we do if we started the game with the first one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 03, 2002, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Install the second one and play on. [shrug]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps a link to the &quot;official&quot; civ3mod.bic file could be included on the GOTM rules page, and updated with each patch.  That way people would have a source of a clean .bic file in the event they have modded theirs or if Firaxis decides to again release multiple versions with future patches.</div></div><hr />
