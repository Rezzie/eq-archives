<br />
They allow you to construct Army (Very powerfull for a military campain) or rush a great/small wonder: if you play conquest style , it can be usefull to rush the forbiden palace in a city <br />
in the conquered land in order to stop the corruption problem around!<br />

I have seen the Zulu AI with at LEAST three great leaders at one time. I believe militaristic civs (except for when the player is the militaristic civ) get a better chance at a great leader.<br />

I was really surprised since in previous games I hadn't received even one.  At least three, if not all four arose before I built the small wonder that increases the chance of getting a great leader.  However, subsequent to building that wonder, I haven't gotten any.<br />

It is probably my pacifistic playing style.  I do generally get at least one if I play with the Japanese or Germans (both militaristic civs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zippo</div><div class="date">Nov 28, 2001, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously, it's possible to get mulitple great leaders... although personally I have only gotten one in all my games. :mad:  Oh well, I worked around it by using the mod abilities available to Civ3.  So for those of you who've beaten the game and/or want to spice things up a bit, check out the Civ3 Creation &amp; Customization Forum... there are tutorials on how to make new units, including a tutorial by yours truly on how to create Buildable leaders (with appropriate costs, of course).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loopy</div><div class="date">Nov 28, 2001, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had two one time, playing as India.  Go figure.  I think the best way to increase your odds is to always make sure you're sending your elite troops into battle, even if it means waiting for them to heal up.  You can't get the percentage for getting a GL unless you're set up for it.  I also think odds roll for getting a GL is one of those things that is saved when you save a game.  At least I was able to reload repeatedly and get the same GL repeatedly after a given order of battles.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, I think the first GL should always go towards an army (since it lets you build three small wonders), and all the rest towards rushing.  Armies are nice and all, but there's a second way to get your second army but only one way to rush a wonder.<br />
<br />
I think I remember seeing that the percentage boost for getting a GL under militaristic wasn't all that great, less than 4% increase?  Though having more elite troops would definately help.  <br />
<br />
Definately nice to have, but going games between them isn't too suprising or too much of a problem, IMNSHO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Completely and totally agree.  I've read many opinions that favor using your first GL for the Forbidden Palace, but I think you use it to make an army and then to get a victory with that army.  You then have the option to build Heroic Epic AND Military Academy.  With Military Academy you can *build* all the armies you want.  At that point, you can use any and all GLs you have simply to rush wonders.</div></div><hr />
