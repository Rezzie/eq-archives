anyone updating the GOTM pages?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2002, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel exactly the same way, but was trying to avoid making a fuss if other didn't feel likewise. Matrix usually has the results up in 2-3 days after the competition closes; as long as I've been here, he's never gone more than 5 days to post the results. It's now been 9 days since the end of the competition, almost 10, and I'm starting to wonder. Is Matrix away or something? I haven't seen him post anywhere recently. Matrix, if you're just busy, let us know so maybe someone else can tabulate the results and at least post them in a thread. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Matrix is extrordinarely busy at the moment. He is working on the results right now, but can only find a few minutes for them.<br />
Therefore it might take a while, but rest assured, they will come out soon. After that he might even update the Archive section. :yeah:<br />
<br />
Oh and skaternate, don´t be too sure about your SS victory! :p<br />
I also have an early SS finish.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

Are you even allowed to allow submit a game after the month is up???</div></div><hr />

Now the top scores for the first 6 games can be found in the archive for the GOTM, but this list also fortunately includes the results from GOTM7! :D Here's the top scoring results from that game: <br />
<br />
SirPleb 18724<br />
Archer 16531<br />
Valeri_Kouznetsov 13597<br />
Patrick_Fremont 12838<br />
Serg 12105<br />
Rain 10389<br />
Lucky 9207<br />
Jove 8482 (a LOSS though :))<br />
Hobbes 8454<br />
Skaternate 8255<br />
<br />
Congrats to all who played, and I think special recognition goes to anyone who won the game at all!</div></div><hr />

We received 99 submissions this time. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jun 13, 2002, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is the full results text:<br />

Civ3 GOTM #7 Results<br />
<br />
The results (http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3gotm/civ3gotm_results_07.shtml) for last month's Deity level GOTM have been posted[! Ninety-nine (99) brave players submitted games, even though nearly 80 percent of them lost the game to the AI. Their efforts should be complimented.  Last month's GOTM was also the first time we asked players to submit their games via an online form. According to Matrix, players who submitted their games via the form were processed twice as fast. We encourage everyone to use the submission form for future GOTMs. <br />
Here are the winners of GOTM #7: <br />
<br />
Gold Medal: SirPleb <br />
Silver Medal: Archer <br />
Bronze Medal: Valeri Kouznetsov <br />
Fastest finish by space ship: Lucky <br />
Fastest finish by domination: Valeri Kouznetsov <br />
Highest score by diplomacy: Alexman <br />
Fastest finish by culture: Sparrowhawk <br />
Congratulations to the winners and thanks everyone for playing the GOTM! <br />
<br />
Yay, just what I hoped for, as I couldn´t milk the game.<br />
I am now 2nd in the Global Ranking. If Sir Pleb would now pause for next few games...<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Jun 13, 2002, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Matrix, how about some recognition for the Fastest Diplomatic Victory? I won by more than 300 years!! ;)<br />
<br />
j/k, you can run the awards however you like. But it's true that my result wasn't even close to the next fastest. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">Jun 13, 2002, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congrats to all that braved GOTM VII.<br />
<br />
I see I'm listed as a domination victory but I was not close to domination. My victory was a diplomatic victory which would put me just in front of Alexman for the diplomatic medal. Sorry, Alexman.<br />
<br />

<br />
There should be an award for earliest defeat. It takes guts to turn in a low score like mine.:lol:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melanic Sheep</div><div class="date">Jun 13, 2002, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">44th, Not bad for my first game of the month AND my first diety level game.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Melanic Sheep 1571 1565 AD Space Race Defeat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">denyd</div><div class="date">Jun 13, 2002, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Matrix managed to assist an AI in reaching a Space Race victory in 1310AD. That's pretty impressive for any CIV to reach space nearly 7 centuries before it happened in the real world.  That CIV was probably walking on the moon before humans originally realized the world wasn't flat!!<br />
<br />
Another set of Kudos to Jove, who managed to lose yet score higher than 12 winners!! I'm betting he had the game won and was milking to the end when all of a sudden somebody launched (probably India, China or Japan). I imagine there was a lot of #@$!&amp;%^#@&amp;# words flying around when that happened!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jove</div><div class="date">Jun 13, 2002, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arrrr, the GOTM7 results are out, and congratulations are in order:<br />
<br />
-Sulla, Fastest Diplomatic Victory, if his claims are true.<br />
<br />
-Pygzilla, Earliest Defeat.<br />
<br />
-Melinder, Lowest Score, Lowest Conquest Defeat Score.<br />
<br />
-Lucky, Last Of Those Who Beat All The Losers.<br />
<br />
-Alex Sensation, Lowest Domination Defeat Score.<br />
<br />
-Matrix, Lowest Space Race Defeat Score.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Were you playing a bootlegged version?? ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Comiserations to those who did worse than me, and congrats to those who did better.<br />
<br />
After doing so dismally, I read lots of posts in the spoilers to see how others played the game, and as a result have done much better in GOTM8 - Thanks to those who go to all the efforts to provide details on their games - has made a big difference.<br />
<br />
I might even get in the top 80 in GOTM8!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">philippe</div><div class="date">Jun 13, 2002, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm i expect to be in the top60.<br />

<br />
Who said you had to submit by forum? I mailed mine to Matrix so it's not in the results! Aaargh, all those lost lonely hours! :(<br />
<br />
:cry:</div></div><hr />

Much congradulations [dance], oh well I'm satisfied with 10th though.  Congrats to all!  [party]</div></div><hr />

<br />
There seems to be a big gap between where i was in the list and the rest of the losers -- oops there is one winner down there :)<br />
Between 2300 and 3300(me) there are no scores.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately a HD crash has disqualified me from GOTM VIII<br />
I would replay, but i know way to much having gotten to 600 AD.<br />
:cry:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jove</div><div class="date">Jun 14, 2002, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arrrr, JoeM, that's a dreadful tale if ever I heard one. It happened to me once, I'll never forget it. Why not post your results here, in this forum, and we'll give you the unofficial credit you deserve, matey.<br />
<br />
And I'll tell ya, Denyd, t'woulda really been something if China  had beat me in GOTM7. One for the record books for sure!</div></div><hr />
