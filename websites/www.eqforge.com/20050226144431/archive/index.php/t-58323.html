<br />
OK, first things first, BRIBE THAT KNIGHT!  We can ill afford to lose any units at this point.  And then keep him outside to pick off barbarian units that come too close to him, take a little pressure off of the forces in Barbfarm.<br />
<br />
Second, if he's not already, wake up the sleeping cavalry in Barbfarm and fortify him.<br />
<br />
Third, keep that diplomat currently standing on the river near Barbfarm dancing around until he gets a chance to swoop in and bribe someone out of the horde that popped up.<br />
<br />
About the horde: I think, other than the diplomat I just mentioned, we let them come to us.  It would seem that they would probably send a good chunk of units at the Chinese, which would take some heat off of Barbfarm.  Still, to be safe, I would get an alpine troop fortified in Barbfarm.  It wouldn't be good for us to lose our foothold on that continent.  After the horde is beaten down/bribed, we should see what we have left and make it a point to take Berlin.<br />
<br />
About Africa: Even if they end up defending with pikemen, we should still be able to easily take *one* city from them with 4 cavalry/3 cavs and an AT.  It may just mean we should build ATs out of Ulundi to start the sweep through Africa, but otherwise it's a minor minor ding in the plans.  (Besides, if we make ATs our primary force in that war, we won't have to worry so much about engineers haulin' ass to build roads right away.  It still should be done at some reasonable point, but they wouldn't have to go into a hot battlefield to build roads.)<br />
<br />
Maybe, since it has no production value worth speaking of due to supported units, we could RB or IRB a destroyer out of Barbarians Suck to stack on top of the galleons as they travel to Africa.  Maybe not a necessity, but who knows.  Barbarians happen.<br />
<br />
Input, please! :D</div></div><hr />

We will soon (probably within 3 turns)discover amphibious warfare so we can build a port facility somewhere plus a veteran destroyer.<br />
<br />
None of our cavalry units are veteran; it is probably a good idea to build barracks somewhere (Dou ?) and at least one veteran cavalry, preferably more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jul 11, 2003, 05:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just remembered that Tim said something about the bonus for pikemen isn't active against cavalry, or something like that. So maybe that shouldn't be a problem.<br />
<br />
I think we have all the cavalries we planned for Africa at least, but we probably should build barracks for future wars and defence.<br />
<br />
A veteran destroyer sounds good, unless they develop GP it should be able to empty the city without any problem at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 11, 2003, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It now occurs to me that we could even empty Zimbabwe with a destroyer and capture it when we start the war, i.e. send one galleon together with a destroyer there. Ulundi could be taken on the same turn. If this causes the Zulus to relocate their capital and thus run out of cash possible bribes from the Zulus are no longer a concern. The bad thing about this is that it delays the start of the war so the best thing may be to start with Ulundi as originally planned and then attack Zimbabwe with a destroyer and cavalry 1-3 turns later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedBull</div><div class="date">Jul 11, 2003, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that since we've played out a few turns anyway, it can't hurt to wait a couple more and get that destroyer up there.  Galleon loads should then change to 3 engineers and 1 military unit to Zimbabwe and 3 military units and a single engineer to Ulundi.<br />
<br />
I'm on my way out the door...be back later tonight (appox. midnight EDT) to post more.</div></div><hr />

I just remembered that Tim said something about the bonus for pikemen isn't active against cavalry, or something like that. So maybe that shouldn't be a problem. Correctomundo!  If the attacker has hitpoints greater than 1 (post-gunpowder) the pikeman bonus is nullified.  Think of it this way, Pikes are effective at stopping a mounted attack against a position (Think: the scene in Braveheart), but they don't help you much if the horses stop 20 yards away and the enemy starts shooting at you!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedBull</div><div class="date">Jul 11, 2003, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well hell, there's no worries about the plan then.  But it does seem a bit better to send a destroyer at Zimbabwe to keep them busy and take Ulundi and Zimbabwe at once, to open two fronts on the continent.  Spread out what defenses they do have.  *Proceeds to go out and buy little red phone :D*</div></div><hr />
