I never pillage as I just figure that city will be mine soon and I'll need those improvements.  In fact, If I'm going after a city I'll work around any settlers/engineers they may have out working the area (unless I can't get by because of ZOC).<br />
<br />
Those partisans are a pain in the rear for sure!  Half the time they won't even attack as they are having too much fun ripping up my railways, closing my mines, and filling in my irrigation.  http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/reddevil.gif<br />
<br />
The only time I would consider using it, I guess, would be to keep a pet city as small as possible, but there are surely better uses for your engineers/settlers.<br />

<br />
A great combo for this is alpine troop stacked with an explorer.Explorer guides while alpine defends and pillages.<br />
<br />
You don't NEED to do it in normal games but it is fun and different.Try a wave of that combo followed by a wave of spys poisoning water supplies.Odd but effective.<br />
<br />
Pillaging roads in Red front was critical.There is one near Moscow on a swamp that when pillaged becomes a killing zone.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise, I just wait until I capture the city so I don't have to rebuild all those irrigation and roads.<br />
<br />
Smash: I'm going to download Red Front right now! I love scenarios when there is a lot of strategy, such as destroying roads and forging alliances, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way the words sounds! I always Pillage! especially in MP. roads and minings. there is no point in pillaging irrigation, the effect of that is hardly noticable on your enemy. While pillaging, your unit also repairs, so there is no point in using Sleep on enemy land. Use Pillage!<br />
<br />
Do you guys watch Cartoon network? there is an &quot;I AM Weazel&quot; episode where a king on an island waits to be pillaged by barbarians, but they all sail by his little island. Then Weazel teaches the king how he can attract barbarians to pillage him. At the end they get pillaged. One of the best &quot;I am Weazels&quot; i have ever seen!</div></div><hr />

I do hate it when the AI or the barbarians pilage roads that I built ontop of a mountain because it took so long to build...<br />

<br />
This is in the same way as stated in THE README file that Ansteig tells YA NOT to put more than 5 units in french cities.<br />
<br />
Shame on you and a curse for your next 3 goodie huts.</div></div><hr />

This scenario can be a killer first time thruhttp://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
I played it once using every trick and cheat that Xin and others could come up with.Berlin fell in early 43.Not much fun.It was better than being completely overrun in summer 41 though http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kittenOFchaos</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2001, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmm...maybe you are right.<br />
<br />
The reason I consider it to be a problem with 'Red Front' as the whole difficulty is that the germans are given move here orders i the events files so as to actually invade -as the AI is lame.<br />
<br />
In the same way NEMO gave the germans tonnes of units so that the AI would stand a chance against the top players.<br />
<br />
I found this scenario to be great fun, but at one point really felt I could lose. The german army died in 1943, but I never did take Berlin...took the rest of Eastern europe, much of germany and poland.<br />
<br />
I blame the yankees and my hate of moving troops from siberia to the front line http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kittenOFchaos</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2001, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">whoops missed the point I was making<br />
<br />
Point:<br />
If you pillage roads the german army won't advance as planned by the game designer.<br />
<br />
I would be lying if I said I didn't pillage the roads myself, and now the shame of doing so is absolved. <br />
<br />
But I rarely did it...round stalingrad I regretted doing it as my counter-attack took ages to get through my own minefields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2001, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One game I pillaged fairly extensively.  Don't remember all the details, but a nearby enemy on a large land mass kept attacking me, but I was busy elswhere and didn't have the forces to commit to all out war.  I had a few alpine troops and cavalry that had been exploring that sort of got caught up deep inside their territory, so I could either hole up in an empty fortress &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/cwm33.gif&quot; border=0&gt; or do something with them.  It was great fun pillaging roads and esp. mines to decreas their production.  Don't know if it really made a difference in the game or not, and with all I've learned through this site, don't see much need for ever doing it again, except perhaps very special situations like slowing down reinforcements.  <br />

This is a &quot;survive till 2020&quot; only strategy and it's very negative, but fortunately I've only needed to do it a couple of times. It also includes switching to Communism, sending out flocks of spies to destroy Wonder building, and deliberately causing global warming. Nasty messy stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drake</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2001, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a large multiplayer game where infastructure is key, pillaging can be one of the worst things that you can do to them. Cutting off roads and railroads from major city to major city can mean the world. If you leave all routes intact, your enemy WILL liberate everything you've taken. I say, pillaging is key in modern warfare. Send in all your dud units to do this task. A good wave of fanatics or other low cost units is perfect for a task like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BigWheel</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2001, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I once had a game where I was getting hammered by the Mongols.  I captured a city that protected my cities from further land attack, moved 4 bombers to the captured city, then pillaged roads adjacent to the city.  All attacking units would stop at my gates and I could use the bombers to pick them off.  (Since the bombers never left the city limits, I could use them every turn instead of the usual every-other-turn attacking.)</div></div><hr />

This was rather annoying, so I started to destroy the fortresses around that area, (especially useful when I was France in a WWI scenario, and the British were fortifying and blocking my lines of supply.)<br />
<br />
Of course, the danger is that some day you might need those fortresses</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you hate it done to you, why do you think it bad to do unto others?<br />
It weakens the city, making it easier to take.<br />
Roads, and irrigation I guess if you want to, can be put back after you take city.<br />

I always just surround the city with units, which in effect starves the city into submission without having to destroy or ruin too many things that I may need once I'm in ownership of Paris, or whatever it may be.</div></div><hr />

It represents true guerilla warfare. The value is demonstrated by a numericaly inferior force slowing down their stronger foes. Thus affording a weaker element the means to resist without sacrificing their limited amount of units. Although it isn't what comes to mind when you think about &quot;civilized&quot; warfare, it still has a place in the game (like it or don't).<br />
