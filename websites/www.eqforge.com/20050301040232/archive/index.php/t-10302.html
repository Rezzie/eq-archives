<br />
Also, in the same game in the year 1940, my population was listed as only 45 million - tiny for a world-spanning empire.<br />
<br />
Finally, the &quot;Children per Family&quot; was listed as only 2. Taking into account people who die young and people who never have children, this would mean that my population was actually declining, but it was definitly growing in the game.<br />
<br />
Granted, these aren't exactly game-breaking bugs, but it would be nice if Firaxis could fix the statistics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The total population is the sum of all your cities. If you count all cities and the population is different than 45 million, then it's really a bug. If not, then admit, you have a small country. <br />
<br />
The familiy size isn't an accurate statistic, it's just proportional to the growth of your cities. If it's 2, it means your cities are growing at an average rate (guess what, not a bug too).<br />
<br />
Just be sure you're dealing with a bug (not something you just don't like) before saying &quot;Damn another bug !&quot;</div></div><hr />

A size one city is something like 10,000 people. Just the United States alone has at least a thousand such cities; so if you put America on a civ map you'd have a LOT of cities to control. I think the overall scope of civ is a bit smaller in terms of population, to make things more managable. Although there's nothing to stop them from scaling all the numbers upwards :p <br />

The total population is the sum of all your cities. If you count all cities and the population is different than 45 million, then it's really a bug. If not, then admit, you have a small country.  I assummed that the majority of the population lived in the area around the city, so the city population would be a fraction of the total population. Cities just represent the focal points of your empire.</div></div><hr />
