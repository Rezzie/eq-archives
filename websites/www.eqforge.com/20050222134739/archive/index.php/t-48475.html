and what hurts me the most is that it has 6 squares in commun with RF : isn't it too much ??<br />
<br />
Where was the other SSC potentiel site ??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">Mar 24, 2003, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets try exploring in the black for a better SSC site. <br />
<br />
As for the rest of exploring, Archer should move back to RF if that is indeed its destination. If not I recommend sending him south or southwest to do more exploring. As for the warrior, keep on going east. If you need any help on determining where to explore, check the expansion poll tha tI made. It should be near or at the top.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think there is time for the Archer to move SW W N into RF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Mar 25, 2003, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few comments:<br />
<br />
LP's production should be changed to settlers.<br />
<br />
RF is about to grow to size 2 so the archer must immediately go there.<br />
<br />
I'm not concerned about a possible big overlap between RF and a possible SSC (we would simply prevent RF from utilizing the squares common to both cities). A bigger worry is the time it would take to build an SSC at the perfect site WSW of RW because of the time needed to change the terrain. So another possibility is to get an SSC running more quickly just to the NE of the warrior where it would have access to two specials. Not as good but still decent.<br />
<br />
LP's warrior should IMO head east and RF's warrior either S or W. We badly need to know what the terrain S of RF looks like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DvR</div><div class="date">Mar 26, 2003, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since we won't have a settler for another 8 turns (unless rush-build), my idea would be to move RF's warrior to the East to see if there's an alternative SSC site.. <br />
<br />
And i agree with theViking, LP's production shoulf be changed to settlers</div></div><hr />
