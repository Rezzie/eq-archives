don't you just love the way that ms handle this one?? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 09, 2002, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've reviewed that now, in great detail.  I have a couple comments, FWIW.  <br />
<br />
First, it is more than a hole.  It is yet another place to park your car.  It is not a single exploit, either.  There are enough variations that even if you could nail one down, a good hacker will simple work another angle.  MS minimized it and referenced prior discussions, and their pitful and trite list of 10.  (10 mostly stupid truisms).<br />
<br />
Second, the kid got better responses and turnaround time that I have with MS.  IBM and powerquest and even CompUSA are all more responsive than MS typicall is.  Of course, this guy decided to put the screws to MS with a deadlilne for release of the info.<br />
<br />
Third, MS is, once again, up sh!t creek without a paddle.  Not from home users, who do not care if MS rapes them and collects their money.  Home users are generally so gullible that they will sallute and bend over when MS orders them to.  The real problem for MS is corpoarate and gov't .   They are not going to migrate to XP as MS expects.   More and more of us are eventually getting into postions where we have more input, and don't like getting the shaft.  Other OSs are becoming more mature, and usable  (and importantly, maintainable &amp; compatible).   But at this time, I agree with the kid that released this info.... MS can do nothing about it.  But MS will pull a clinton and lie &amp; mislead people about it.  <br />
<br />
Fourth, Funny how even the writer of the article manages to shift some of the blame for a poor OS design to the application programmers. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fifth, at this moment, the issue is not a problem for average users, like most CFC members.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Last, I can say with strong confidence that this massive and unrepairable problem with the fundamental OS will not launch a cruise missile.  We do not launch missiles with windows or MS.    We do it with specifically designed systems, operating independantly, typically with a UNIX OS.  The places I've worked use windoze on machines that assimilate data from various sources and display it for the Big Boys to look at, sort of like the movie War Games.   In the Bosnian war, I worked in the War Room, and Windoze crashed every 2.5 to 3 hours, with almost Swiss precision.  Even our commanding general knew and tolerated the times when the Big Board went  blank, and and someone could go over and reboot the stupid MS operating system that collected the inputs from the secure systems and display .  Meanwhile, the generals had to move their feet and walk over to the individual consoles to track the intercepts, traffic, ground units, etc.  A pain to the big guys, and annoying to the rest of us, but no danger of launching missiles.... MS is well known in the proper circles for being an unreliable and corruptable OS, and no one I've ever met would trust it to even run properly, much less with someone's life.<br />
<br />
LOL.<br />
<br />
<br />
:lol:<br />
<br />
<br />
So sorry, MS ain't gunna launch missiles, cruise or otherwise!</div></div><hr />

So sorry, MS ain't gunna launch missiles, cruise or otherwise! Well, not US missiles at least ;)<br />
<br />
I guess that the US export controls laws may unwittingly stop it happening from other countries as well :lol:<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously, I would assume that there is more than a software launch mechanism anyway - I have designed safety systems that need a certain level of integrity, and you simply don't rely on software at all.</div></div><hr />
