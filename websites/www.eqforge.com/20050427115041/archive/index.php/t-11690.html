It looks like there are a lot of newbies to the site who have dethrown alot of the high scoring Civ 2 players.</div></div><hr />

First of all, i got a settler out of my first goody hut, then with those 2 cities i made a lot of archers and warriors to attack the first civ i encountered, the aztecs.  I made a few more cities towards the directions of the enemy, while i already had taken over the aztec capital with my first couple of units. This nearly always works.<br />
Then i simply marched on with the archers to take over easy cities with warriors as their only defense, and capturing as many setttlers/workes to construct a road from north to south. My civ's spine.  When i got iron working all i did was make immortals, and they're simply the best early on. The aztecs, babs and zulus were slaughtered with ease by them :king:<br />
<br />
With the discovery of mapmaking i cranked out galleys like mad, (as well as immortals) to look for the last two civs.<br />
I lost quite some galleys and immortals though when i found them and send them over the ocean linea recta. But enough arrived, and there the last 2 civs were no match for my special unit :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smirk</div><div class="date">Dec 11, 2001, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just got civ3 a few weeks ago so I didn' get to play gotm1, but I decided to try it out anyway, since I can see how you all did already.<br />
<br />
Its about 600BC I think now and I've defeated the aztecs and babs so far. They didn't respawn, but I've played on small maps before when they have, even near to where they just got destroyed. Why isn't that happening in this game? Because of the low difficulty?<br />
<br />
I doubt I can finish the americans and iroqious off in 200 years, or 10 turns whatever it is. They have their small island developed, and my cities aren't producing enough to make all the galleys to ship enough immortals over to take them out quick.<br />
<br />
I didn't actually start my conquest until I got iron working, so maybe that was the difference and what allowed you to do so well. I've had games where I've destroyed civs with the warriors I initially build, but they always respawn so I stopped bothering with that.<br />
<br />
Amazingly early in the game when I was scouting out the map, the babs settled a city but didn't have any defenders in it, I jumped on that one quick, so the babs only had one city when i came back to finish them off. I guess that can only happen on the low difficulty games. Anyway great job on that map.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remind me not to play adjacent to you in multiplayer :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cutiestar</div><div class="date">Dec 12, 2001, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I downloaded EEKthedogs game so i could replay it and learn<br />
<br />
WOW, i notice the main factor in EEK beating Aeson was that EEK took his caravels around the light blue squares, but when he went past the first island he never went around it to check, or even the second island, he went straight to the third island that had the two other civs on it. Aeson totally cleared the grey area around those other islands, as most of us would have.<br />
<br />
EEK if you read this can you tell me if this score was your first look at this GOTM's map? because also against the Aztec you didn't uncover the west corner of their map on your island either yet you uncovered all the rest that had cities.<br />
<br />
You are one lucky dog<br />
<br />
congratulations, I actually have just finished trying to emulate your achievement, but I knew exactly where everything was and what i needed, and guess what, I still wasn't able to do it as quick as you EEK.   You Rule :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Dec 12, 2001, 02:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually lost close to 200 years I think by sending my first scout galleys the wrong way, and due to losing a few galleys (3 galleys, 5 elite Immortals IIRC) to keyboard/touchpad mishaps.  The rest of the difference between my victory and EEK's is probably due to the fact that I waited for Immortals to start my conquest (32 turns to research Iron working, a few more to get the Iron connected by road).  I did catch the babs with an undefended city I think, though that might have been the second time I played, to see what the early settler had meant to my score.  Turned out that getting the early settler was about a 2000 point difference, as I wasn't able to finish conquest until 600AD without it.  This was with the same build pattern and without the galley mishaps or turns lost sending units in the wrong direction.  Its too bad that something so completely out of the players hands makes so much difference.  <br />
<br />
If I had it to do over again, I would have made at least 2 or 3 archers while I was waiting for Iron working. And instead of spearmen I would have built warriors (2 for 1).  Also building the forbidden palace with my one leader was a mistake, the lighthouse would have been a much better use for the leader.  Even without the galley mishaps, it would cut 10 to 20 turns off the transit to the American/Iroquois Island.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Airness</div><div class="date">Dec 12, 2001, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't really see GOTM1 as a real &quot;competition&quot;.<br />
<br />
1) it was a small map with 5 civs all close by.  Perfect setting for a fast conquest.<br />
<br />
2) Yes, I agree with Aeson, fooling around with the first hut to get that second settler definitly help.  Imagine rushing the imortals at 2 for 1 rate...<br />
<br />
3) Early conquest is very easy to achieve becuse <br />
     a) AI does not build barracks early, all defenders are regular.<br />
     b) AI does not build walls early...<br />
<br />
4) There were plenty of &quot;tips&quot; in the *spoiler * section where people post their finished games for others to see :) <br />
<br />
5) The map was so small you could actually play several times to &quot;get it right&quot;  :)<br />
<br />
In my game i actually got my A** kicked a little by the Aztecs early cause I was using worriors, and those Jag worriors just dance around me and i could not do a thing.... As I lost a city, I rushed one of my worker to the iron patch and build a colony, then the tide turned....<br />
<br />
I would think GOTM2 is a much better test of overall skill of a player, large map, large land mass, limited and localized resource/lux.  It would take some serious civ management skills, diplo skills, good planning and good decision making in order to achieve high score.  And this one is not very &quot;re-doable&quot;.<br />
<br />
Tip for GOTM2:<br />
<br />
1) Take out Romans ASAP, you dont need them, you need the island.  Maybe leave a few Roman cities to help you research techs.<br />
<br />
2) Try to get the Light House and take out Aztec, there is a complete SEA route connecting you with the Aztec island, at least take control of all their silk :D<br />
<br />
3) With the patch, you can't trade over the ocean squares early, so you should get NAVIGATION or Magnetism ASAP so you can start trading lux/res with 7 other civs, very importand in your game development.<br />
<br />
Navigation is MUCH easier to research cause it requires only a few cheaper techs to reach.<br />
<br />
HF all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smirk</div><div class="date">Dec 16, 2001, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I played this after the fact again and I finished at around 530BC, with a point score of 8001 on the dot.<br />
<br />
I got that same settler, and also with my first warrior I took out the aztec capital, forcing him into a respawn. Which netted me 2 more techs and 100 gold, and 2 gold per turn for a while. I researched iron working and then up to map making. Part way thru destroying the Zulu's I got a great leader which created the great lighthouse. The only effect of that was that I needed to build less galleys since I could shuttle my immortals back and forth faster.<br />
<br />
I still didn't attack much with warriors and archers. I think I only made one archer. Its just not effective since they end up just dying and that equals a waste of resources. So I just got in the way, took out a few settler parties here and there, didn't attack any cities with spearmen until I had the immortals.<br />
<br />
One side effect of forcing a respawn of the aztecs was that the babs didn't leave their second city undefended like so many others were able to see. Still think I was better off since I got 2 free techs and 100 gold from the respawn, not to mention a good wheat square city.<br />
<br />
Unlike eek, I was stickly roads and pop rushing. The only land improvements in my land were from the conquered's workers. Although if there was any fresh water I would have irrigated some squares for better growth. Also I only built graneries and some barracks (not all) the galley building cities only got grans.<br />
<br />
One problem with that... lots of cultures losses, I lost the first zulu town like 2 times before I managed to get past it and take out his capital. (Although that did lead to my great leader.) Once I got to the american/iroqious island, I just started razing. I didn't figure on being on there long enough to produce more units. Although think I kept the capital with a barracks for some retreat healing.<br />
<br />
I did send this to the HOF person so maybe you'll see it there and if you're interested d/l it and check it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
The concurrent random number generator kinda makes the game boring since its repeatable, you could potentially play thru move by move and reach some perfect game for any given map. Not likely on anything but the small ones. Gives me an idea for a Quake Done Quick sort of challenge. Obviously only interesting to us fast conquest types.</div></div><hr />
