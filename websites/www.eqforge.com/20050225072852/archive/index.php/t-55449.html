About settler in BP:<br />
I can't find where or who, but someone thought we should use the settler to improve land. Since we I can't find a build queue for BP, I started a new settler and decided to build C4 with this settler (it needs to clear jungle and also some protection from start).<br />
<br />
Problem: Tenochtitlan (destination for our Dou caravans) just changed demand...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Jun 10, 2003, 03:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't tell from the screen shot--are there more Chinese units near Berlin?  If it seems they are in immediate danger of actually taking the city then I say revolt it and claim it for our own.  Otherwise, leave it for the time being, but perhaps use the dip to explore around the area a bit and see if there is a Chinese city nearby?  This would both mean a constant stream of Chinese units attacking Berlin, and probably mean any units released from Berlin would head that direction, not towards us.<br />
<br />
Are we in a position to bribe Mycenae?  that might make a useful foothold on the Greeks if we're in a position to hold it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 10, 2003, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I clearly remember that we are not allowed to bribe cities because I forgot it myself when discussing a dangerous barbarian invasion early in the game :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, we can't bribe cities, only units. But we can use Mycenae as a second barb farm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe we shall try to get Chinese and Greek maps to see how bad it is.<br />
