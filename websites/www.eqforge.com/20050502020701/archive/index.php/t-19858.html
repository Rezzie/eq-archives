<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2002, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, here's the deal. I was speaking on the chat with a few GOTMers and we had an idea. So, subject to approval by matrix, here it is:<br />
<br />
Should there be an award for fastest completion of the Tech tree in the GOTM?<br />
<br />
Please vote yes or no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2002, 10:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this is a great idea.  I have finished the tech tree only once in any Civ 3 game.  Having an award for earliest completion of the tech tree would definitely add a new playstyle.<br />
<br />
The only problem is that the player would be required to retire, to show the date in which they researched the last tech.  I still think it would make a great addition to the current list of awards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirPleb</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2002, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is this much different from the Spacerace? Maybe I'm missing something but it seems very similar to me. I think that the Spacerace is essentially a tech race, with some production capacity required at the end to finish it. The Spacerace doesn't need 7 of the final techs, but whoever gets the Spacerace first probably has the research capacity to also get those seven techs first...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chiefpaco</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2002, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard to say for me because in the dozen or so games I've ever played through, I've never finished the tree.  I think SirPleb is sort of right.  However, it might take a little something else to stop everyone else from winning by the space race or any other way, for that matter.  Difficulty level could be a big factor.<br />
<br />
I think just by curiosity, I'd like to play out a game going for this!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2002, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a lot like the Space Race of course.   <br />
<br />
The Space Race requires 9 out of 17 modern techs.  This would require all 17.  It would also require the player to keep the other AI from launching before they could research the remaining techs.  It's just an idea to actually make the second half of the Modern Age matter.<br />
<br />
The first incarnation of the idea was a future tech count.  This would basically end up as a &quot;milking&quot; award though, which we already have the medals (and to a certain extent, Diplomatic) for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2002, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's impractical and therefore impossible to do. We can't see at what date the person finished the tech tree, so that would mean everyone who has come so far should have to say it in the submission. That would mean extra rules etc.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but even if it's a nice idea, it's just not possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dikwhit</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2002, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL IF YOUR GOING FOR THE SPACERACE ANYWAY caps oops, 7 extra techs X the probable tech/4 turns so 27 turns from when you can build last component. Is this the frickin olympics?? everyone gets a medal ????   Some games your the bug, some games your a windshield.<br />
:D :D :D</div></div><hr />
