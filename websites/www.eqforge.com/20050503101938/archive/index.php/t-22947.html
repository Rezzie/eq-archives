In the U.S., we've got a 3-day weekend coming and it would be great to have the time to play a large (or even huge GOTM) and just for the heck of it, make it a 16 player game (maybe even one of those with a required type of finish)!!<br />
:D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LaRo</div><div class="date">May 21, 2002, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, I have finished the game for one week and I don't want to start another game before gotm 8.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are, in fact, people still playing the game as well. And I hope that we never do a huge map, as I don't want to spend 30 minutes waiting per turn for the other civs to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Next month German panzers will rule the battlefield!  :tank:<br />
<br />
PS: Don't you think it's great that we don't need to repeat playing the Civs for a long time? By the time we play the 16th Civ, the Romans, in February 2003, we'll have another 8 new Civs to play, thanks to the expansion!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pompeynunn</div><div class="date">May 22, 2002, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please don't make it a Chieftan game - I would like the GOTM to be challenging. Make it at least Regent - in fact, Regent would be a good level, we haven't played that for a while.<br />
<br />
I would also like a large map with a fair number of civs - maybe even the full 16.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Iver-P</div><div class="date">May 22, 2002, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two points:<br />
<br />
#1 I assume that MATRIX has already prepared, and maybe even uploaded the June GOTM. So there is no point begging for a certain level or map size.<br />
<br />
#2 If you want to spend your Memorial Day Weekend playing CIV, well, I suppose you can. But, I plan to get out and enjoy the unofficial &quot;first days of summer&quot;. But if you really REALLY want to play a GOTM, maybe you should have planned ahead and by saving GOTM7 for this weekend. ;)<br />
<br />
BTW - Summers are short in the Dakotas!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taé Shala</div><div class="date">May 22, 2002, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A regent level game would be fine. :D<br />
<br />
And may I request a map with lots of water?<br />
I love all these naval battles! :fish:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">May 22, 2002, 02:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven´t even started this months GOTM and some people already request the next one! :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
But please NO chieftain for next month, even Warlord was far too easy.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LaRo</div><div class="date">May 22, 2002, 07:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The current gotm was hard at diety and previous was easy at warlord. I suppose the next gotm will be in the middle. regent or monark.</div></div><hr />

A gotm at Monarch isn't such a bad Idea, cause from what I can gather, thats where you and the comps are even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BillChin</div><div class="date">May 23, 2002, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone who is really itching to play Civ III this holiday weekend can try the May Apolyton game:<br />
<br />
http://64.246.32.51/~admin1/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=49114<br />
<br />
It is Regent level as Chinese, and a fun time is being had by all participants (especially after the tough Deity level game).  A good player can probably complete the game during the long weekend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any chance you could upload it to this thread?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I kind of like Chieftain mode. :)<br />
<br />
Besides, I see 3 good reasons.<br />
<br />
1. It's one level the GOTM hasn't been on yet.<br />
2. It's a refreshing game after this GOTM7 (I finished in 1 day. :))<br />
3. We can see how the pros score in this, and try to match them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">God</div><div class="date">May 24, 2002, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't played the past 2 GOTMs, because I tried diety and don't feel like completing it. I refuse to have another loss on my HOF :D (like its so great :D). I didn't play the warlord game because it looked really boring. <br />
<br />
I hope we play regent or monarch. I won't play the chieften game because it will be ridiculous. Half of us will finish at 10 AD, and the rest will milk it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok.  Here is the 4000 BC file.  You may want to set the preferences to what you are used to.  <br />
<br />
You do not have to be registered to download, but the Apolyton board has been real flaky as far as downloads recently.  You do have to register to post (and submit a game).  Many of the same folks that post here are registered on Apolyton.  Though your screen name may be taken :)</div></div><hr />

Finish at 10 AD!?!?<br />

I'm not *THAT* good yet. :) My games still finish around 1850-2050.</div></div><hr />

Matrix has already sent the save game to me. It should be posted in less than 10 hours. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jasonc</div><div class="date">May 31, 2002, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, I apologize if this is OT, but I can't seem to find the GOTM FAQ.  I'm looking for it because I have what is probably a rather simply question that I can't find the answer to.  Namely, is there a cutoff date for submitting GOTM final turns?  I just discovered them (GOTM's) and would like to play the latest one (I'm a glutton for punishment) but I'm not sure if it's too late or not.  <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunderfall</div><div class="date">May 31, 2002, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome to the forum, Jasonc. :) <br />
<br />
The Civ3 GOTM saved games are due the 2nd of each month, so the current GOTM is due June 2nd, and the next GOTM (#8) will be due July 2nd. <br />
<br />
I'll add this info to the GOTM rules page...</div></div><hr />

And I'll be the .000000001% that still doesn't know what they're doing wrong. :)<br />
<br />
It STILL takes me well into 1850-2050 to win a Chieftain game - and I can't even milk the game right!</div></div><hr />
