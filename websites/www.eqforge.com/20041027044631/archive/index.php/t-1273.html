<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CornMaster</div><div class="date">Feb 12, 2001, 09:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to write story like scenario.  It has a story line....if you win the mission you start the next one....if you lose then you play another one.  Tech...and city improvements mean nothing.  You just have to complete the mission in the time frame that you have.  I hope to have about 10 scenarios at the end so missions if you win/and lose.<br />
<br />
Has anyone ever played such a scenario???  Where your not a civ but a group on a mission??  The current one (one I was working on last night) is a training mission.....you are dropped in a hostile terrian with 4 hunters, yourself, and a raft to get around the poisoned creeks.  You must capture all the escaped terrorists.  Since the terrian is so inhospitible, resources are VERY low and recuiting people to become your hunters is hard.  As you capture the terrorists you will receive the bounty.  This allows you to recruit more hunters (and build missiles) to combat the terrorists.  You have 60 days (turns) to capture them all.  Since they are unsuspecting of your attack, they can't move......<br />
<br />
Anyway....and that's just the training mission!!!!  Anyway I need to rework the unit graphics and write the events file and I should be finished the training part.<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to TOTALLY stop tech from being researched??<br />

<br />
Or...use the techs as message boxes that say: <br />
<br />
&quot;You have just remembered your:&quot;<br />
<br />
First Mission...<br />
<br />
Of course, you would have to change the part that says, &quot;You have just discovered:&quot; to &quot;You have just remembered your:&quot; in the Game.txt file...<br />
<br />
This way you could have a few unexpected messages not in the events.txt<br />
<br />
...just an idea<br />

It's called 'The Quest for Eldorado', by Jesus Balsinde, and can be found on the Spanish Civilization site. You might get some ideas from that one. <br />

<br />
I was just wondering if it could be totally gone, but not that bad if it's still there.<br />
<br />
Anyone notice Civ 2 crashes a lot under Win2k when editing the events.txt file???  It must have closed on my 10 times last night.  As well as some other odd side effects (Picture to come)<br />

But you can use alternate - cut off technology tree (you don't want them to be researched but EARNED during mission, right?). Then give every civ ONE tech leading into Future Tech (you can call it whatever). Every civ will be reaserching future techs - and real technology will be available only by events after completing quests.</div></div><hr />

There are some very nice Luna screenshots at http://www.lunagame.com/gallery/screenshots.asp <br />
<br />
I think they got those ideas from your Lunar scenario!  http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />

That link is a cool one...it looks like a pretty good game. <br />
<br />
You know with all this excitement about the U.S. landing on Eros, I should make an asteroid scenario...that could be cool...<br />
