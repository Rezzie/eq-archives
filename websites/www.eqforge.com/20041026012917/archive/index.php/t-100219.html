Thought I'd share part of the story so far.<br />
<br />
COMRADE STALIN<br />
A Timeline of the Great Patriotic War<br />
<br />
June 1940-- Axis powers attack France and the Low Countries. Despite heavy French, Allied, and Neutral losses, Hitler's men only gain Amsterdam. Axis attacks on Allied shipping lead to massive retaliation; several U-Boats sunk. Allied troops liberate Amsterdam from the evil German's clutches. Allied counterattack saves Paris from certain destruction.<br />
<br />
Comrade Stalin looks over the news with pleasure. Things are going badly for Hitler's Axis. He immediately sets in motion a plan. First, he begins work on a massive rail program linking all major Russian cities. Second, he begins an armament campaign to &quot;modernize the armed forces of the Motherland.&quot; Orders are given for the manufacture of many guns, tanks, and planes, and funding is given to the construction of Barracks in key cities. Forces in Siberia are called west.<br />
<br />
August 1940--The Allies and French continue to hold the Axis beast at bay. Barracks are completed in Voronezh, Stalingrad, and Moscow. Comrade Stalin waits as the Siberian forces stall in the undeveloped hinterlands.<br />
<br />
October 1940--Axis forces retake Amsterdam. Axis attack on France begins in earnest as Paris capitulates and Marsailles and Strasbourg are pounded by aerial assaults. The French government surrenders shortly thereafter. U-Boats continue to wreak havoc in the North Atlantic. Allies announce they have developed Advanced Flight.<br />
<br />
December 1940--Axis win minor naval engagement in the North Sea. Premier Petain, new leader of France, renounces alliance with Allies under Axis pressure. First new tanks roll off production lines beyond the Urals. Comrade Stalin spends a merry Christmas in the Crimea.<br />
<br />
February 1941--Axis U-Boat sinks Allied Transport full of supplies destined for the Western Front. Finnish troops make threatening movements towards Leningrad. Grozny finishes Barracks. First contingent of Armor from beyond the Urals reaches Leningrad.<br />
<br />
April 1941--U-Boats continue to ravage the North Atlantic sea lanes. General Rommel's advance on Egypt stalls near Alexandria at a place called &quot;El Alamein.&quot; German battleship Bismarck engages and sinks English equivalent Hood in the North Sea. German bombardment of Thames Estuary coastal defenses is largely a failure. Comrade Stalin's &quot;One Million Rails&quot; Plan begins to bear fruit.<br />
<br />
June 1941--Soviet Spies report that the Axis has developed a V-1 rocket. More Allied ships are lost to Germany's U-Boat campaign. &quot;Battle of Britain&quot;; valiant Britsh fighter pilots engage and destroy several Axis bombers over English skies. Axis offensive in the Balkans begins with the bombing of Belgrade. Axis troops movements in Poland are regarded as &quot;potentially hostile.&quot; Leningrad, Minsk, and Kiev are reinforced by newly trained Armor divisions.<br />
<br />
August 1941--Axis V-1 &quot;Flying Bombs&quot; launched against Allied battleships, causing some damage but no sinkings. In a stunning move, Allied leader Winston Churchill and Axis heads Mussolini and Hitler work out the &quot;Paris Accord,&quot; agreeing to end hostilities. Belgrade falls to Axis Paratroopers. british fight-bombers are shot down in a bombing run over Ireland. Fighter patrols show massive concentrations of German troops along the Polish-Soviet border. Stalin sends Molotov to Berlin; the &quot;Berlin treaty&quot; is signed, promising &quot;perpetual peace&quot; between Nazis and Soviets. Stalin, having intended to provoke the German leader into war, is furious, but decides to use the opportunity to build up.<br />
<br />
October 1941--BETRAYAL!! Axis launch sneak attack against the Russians! The call to arms sounds throughout the Motherland. Soviet ambassadors meet with British government in hopes of persuading the Allies to join them; due to Allied demands, the Soviets leave incensed. Fighters shoot down Ju-87 bombers over Lithuanian skies. In a brutal battle, Soviet Armor secures Helsinki; Finnish government flees. Red Army begins offensive into Poland.<br />
<br />
December 1941--German troops capture Riga. The Allies develop Computers. Soviet offensive into Poland crushed by spirited German defense. Soviet pilots, on one-way mission, shoot down another wave of German Bombers. Partisans, assisted by the 1st Parachute Division, liberate Riga.<br />
<br />
February 1942--As the harsh Russian winter enters its thaw, the Wehrmacht fails to break the Soviet defenses. Pre-emptive strike destroys more German Bombers over the Pripyat Marshes. Soviet 30th Tank Division ambushes Axis invasion spearhead in Poland and destroys it. &quot;One Million Rails&quot; Plan nears completion. Conference held in Sevastopol; Turks and Spanish agree to declare war on Axis.<br />

<br />
My guess is that, even though the French lost their entire garrison, they inflicted enough damage on the Axis' attack force to reduce their movement. It didn't make much sense to me either, considering that the city remained undefended until the Axis' next turn...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Part 2: The Polish Offensive and the Fall of Berlin<br />
<br />
April 1942--Axis assault begins in earnest. Smolensk completes Barracks. Fighter-bombers strafe reinforcement columns in Poland and Austria. Troop buildup in Minsk begins as the western cities are linked to the Urals.<br />
<br />
June 1942--German tank offensive begins; objective appears to be Minsk. Counterattack destroys main elements of German push but fails to take Konigsberg. Fighter patrols indicate movement of Axis Marine divisions in southern Poland.<br />
<br />
August 1942--Operatives within eneym territory announce that the Axis has developed Mass Production. Axis forces continue to pound away at the border.<br />
<br />
October 1942--After months of grueling siege, the stalwart Red Army seizes Konigsberg. The city treasury of 86 gold is transferred into the hands of the Supreme Soviet. The few Partisans that arise are ruthlessly crushed. Stalin announces that his call for &quot;One Million Rails&quot; has been &quot;heard and answered.&quot; Fighters intercept and destroy a squadron of German bombers over Polish skies.<br />
<br />
December 1942--The Red Army's progress is halted by a significant Axis aerial campaign. Rioting in the streets of Riga. Soviet pilots retaliate against bombing runs, shooting down many Axis bombers.<br />
<br />
February 1943--Turkish army attacks Bucharest. Axis forces strike Stockholm. KGB operatives reveal the Allies have Rocketry. Massive offensive into Poland initiated; the city of Warsaw is encircled. In celebration of the conclusion of Russia's mass railroad-building campaign, the 53rd Novosibirsk Tank Reg't., fresh from training, parades in Red Square before shipping out to the front.<br />
<br />
April 1943--Turkish Romania Offensive stalls. After taking heavy losses, Army Group North, under the command of Marshal Georgi Zhukov, takes Warsaw. Partisan resistance is eliminated. Fresh units dispatched to replace losses on the battlefront.<br />
<br />
June 1943--Red Army takes Krakow. Few forces can be spared to deal with Partisans due to the severe conditions after the assault, but three fresh divisions are called up to deal with the problem. Combat engineers are called to link the new conquests by rail with the Soviet Union.<br />
<br />
August 1943--Axis develops Miniaturization. Axis spoiling attack disrupts operations around Krakow. Soviet troops move into position in eastern Germany. Democratic Republic of Poland, consisting of the &quot;liberated&quot; cities of Warsaw and Krakow, set up in Warsaw as a pro-Soviet puppet government.<br />
<br />
October 1943--German disruption near Krakow continues. Ukrainian 3rd Army, under the command of General Ivan Konev, begins offensive into Hungary. Russian and Axis rail systems linked; Stalin presented with a monumental plan--an offensive into the German heartland, led by Marshal Zhukov himself! Stalin of course, approves this plan after some deliberation; the plan is code-named the Karl Marx Offensive, in honor of the German founder of Communism. Soon, the Soviet Red Army grabs the attention of the world with the INVASION OF GERMANY; before the beginning of the massive offensive, Stalin personally visits his troops and offers words of encouragement. Then, the famed command of &quot;Forward, Comrades, forward!&quot; is given over the radio by Marshal Zhukov himself, and Operation Marx begins. Within days of its initiation, Dresden falls after being subjected to truly massive artillery bombardment. Desperate German citizens flee the city to engage in Partisan operations. Berlin itself comes under attack, but the Wehrmacht, with the assistance of the population and much bloodshed, defiantly defends its capital against charging Russian steel.<br />
<br />
December 1943--Konev's forces take Budapest and mop up some Partisan resistance. Berlin, the German capital, resists heavy artillery bombrdment and is only taken after heavy house-to-house fighting. The fall of the Reichstag, though in no way signaling an end to the fighting, bolsters Soviet morale, as its capture is symbolic of the coming fate of the Axis. Once the area is secure, Stalin personally awards the 25th Tank Reg't. the Order of the Red Banner, the Soviet Union's highest honor. Days later, Adolf Hitler is found dead in a secret bunker, having committed suicide. German leadership passes to Admiral Karl Doernitz. Under cover of snow, thousands flee the city to participate in Partisan activities, still hoping for a miracle to beat off the &quot;Red Scourge,&quot; as they call it.</div></div><hr />
