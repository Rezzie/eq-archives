An underground terror organisation working to free the people of CFC manages to stage a coup d'etat. After a year of anarchy and public hangings of former leaders the former terrorists sign the new constitution instituting Democracy and free trade within CFC. The people's hope is rising and many now think we owe the rest of the world the same freedom, demanding that the government by any means free the world from evil dictators and societies where everybody don't have the same rights.<br />

I'll stop playing here for a few reasons:<br />
Shall we build a wonder (WS) for next turn in RF?<br />
What shall we pursue next, after communism, which we might discover next turn?<br />
How to deal with the French?<br />
Where shall we position our troops? Most are now in Dover and Paris...<br />
Shall we refound Mozzarella? How to solve engineer shortage in Jayneland, we lost three + a city?<br />
We need to know where celebrations will be good, and where they need extras, like routes and improvements.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants a part of the map, ask for it or check the game file. It takes quite a lot of time making maps for all provinces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WS: Don't build it just yet. After we get communism next turn, build the UN instead.  With the UN, we can get the Senate to allow us to take out France.<br />
<br />
Troops: We're still at war with Montezuma.  We can think of sending some troop out of Paris to the Aztecs.  Troops in Dover can do the same, or can perpare to take on China.<br />
<br />
Those are all the comments I have..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedBull</div><div class="date">Aug 31, 2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, definitely build the UN.  Lax and indecisive as they can be, it'll allow us to finish off the French.  <br />
<br />
Other than that, it seems I have little work to do for now.  Will keep self posted...let me know when we're considering a rush to armor so I know when we'll be working on finishing off the rest, so I can know when I have some planning to help with.</div></div><hr />

We actually have vans for both, but we also want HD soon.<br />
<br />
I assume want factories in some well chosen cities? Maybe EF, VM and Dou?<br />
<br />
The problem with the french is that they don't want a war wih us. Once we get UN, we can probably get a war.<br />
<br />
When we get communism, we also will have a slightly harder time to keep the cities happy. The effect of Mike's reduced...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any word on the next turns?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Sep 11, 2003, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I won't spend half a day on my weekend on something that so few cares up. But since it's a new month, maybe we should have a new election, and see if we can get more people here? It isn't very much left of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Sep 11, 2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are running on the 'continued volunteer' schedule right now.  If you do not want to continue as President, just say so and we'll find another volunteer.  If we have more than one volunteer, we'll have an election.<br />
<br />
The fact that the game is almost over is why we have so few people.  I think this will also be our last Civ II Demogame.  Each time the participation drops lower and lower.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Sep 11, 2003, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been too busy recently to pay much attention to this game - sorry. Real life interfered and my 5 turns in the D+2 succession game took a huge amount of time.<br />
<br />
However, I'm still interested, I've learnt considerably from this game, especially about micromanaging an SSC. So I could continue as domestic advisor but would prefer someone else taking over - if someone else is found.<br />
<br />
Depending on interest (or lack of interest...), one possibility would be to quickly finish the game by switching again to fundy and flood the world with cavalry. Could probably take less than 20 turns.</div></div><hr />
