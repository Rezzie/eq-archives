Does it refer to a Star Trek computer again? or something like that? Can't find the answer on google, that is really strange. And btw, what's the code N3RDZ mean too? Saw it somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pillager</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume N3RDZ means NERDS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1337 = leet is derived from ELITE, often used by hackers and crackers to describe their groups and themselves. :lol:<br />
<br />
And N3RDZ is indeed nerds.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

Ever since I was using BBSes back in 1990, way before the internet was out, there has always been an &quot;elite&quot; crowd. For awhile it meant, to some people, pirating games. The word &quot;kewl&quot; used to be, and by some people still is, an &quot;elite&quot; way of spelling cool; although, I have a friend that has nothing to do with computers besides using Instant Messenger that types &quot;kewl&quot; instead of cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Btw, Nerd= hacker?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nerd = geek ..... in other words, someone that is not one of the cool people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not always, some nerds are also considered as elite and &quot;kewl&quot;, some even proudly call themselves 1337 N3RDZ. And are often accepted in the &quot;underground&quot; society. :mischief:<br />
<br />
It depends on what type of nerd you are.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In 1996 if you wanted to hack something you could almost just ask to change the page or tell them they need to turn over the page because of some new law! I remember reading a website where the owners let some guy put up images and messages on his own page for free because of the disablilty act. People back then were so gulliable :)</div></div><hr />

I just don't get that stupid way of spelling. And the worst is they seem to find that &quot;mystical&quot; spelling exciting... Dumb nerds. English is already a special language, no need to write such encrypted way I guess... Bah.</div></div><hr />

Our Father, who 0wnz heaven, j00z r0x0r! May all 0ur base someday be belong to you! May j00z 0wnz earth just like j00z 0wnz heaven. Give us this day our warez, mp3z, and pr0n through a phat pipe. And cut us some slack when we act like n00b lamerz, just as we teach n00bz when they act lame on us. Please don't give us root access on some poor d00d'z box when we're too pissed off to think about what's right and wrong, and if you could keep the f3i off our backs, we'd appreciate it. For j00z 0wnz r00t on all our b0x3n 4ever and ever, 4m3n.</div></div><hr />
