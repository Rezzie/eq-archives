<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exsanguination</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just tried to make a custom avatar fom the Alexander the great picture from civ3, but it was too big. I saved it as a jpg, too big. gif, too big. bmp, too big. pcx, way too big. so I had to reduce its size drastically (seen to the left) to make it &lt;4KB.<br />
<br />
Any tips for reducing the size of picture files? (or better yet, lets allow larger size avatars - maybe 5/6KB?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although I dont have my Avatar yet ( only 15 more posts to go :D ). I have downloaded some pictures and tey excead the max limit. The only way is with the *.bmp file and doing the stretch to make the image smaller. Luckly in Windows XP, The pain program can save a *.bmp file to  a *.jpg or *.gif.<br />
<br />
I would go with the *.jpg file and the best part of *.jpg files is that no color changes happens (unlike saving as a *.Gif where you lose some colors)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Aug 03, 2002, 04:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">.jpg has the best compression to quality ratio.  I don't know how it is that you can't get the max 65x65 square under 4KB.  I've got mine at 65x65 and it's only 2.2KB.  Try reducing the color depth.  I was able to drop your size down from 3.5KB to 1.3KB just by reducing it to 4 bit color.  And at that size, the difference between 16 colors and 256 colors is negligable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 03, 2002, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The best compression is ultimately judged by the &quot;eye&quot;.  The human eye can be fooled (actually, the brain), and knowing these tricks can help you edit an Avatar (as I've been inding in the last day or two).<br />
<br />
1.  GIF - Compression lends itself most effectively to consecutive same-color value pixels horizontally.  GIF will store 256 or fewer colors in a palette.  The choice of optimization will affect the quality.  GIF will be loseless in terms of detail, but lossy in terms of color  fidelity.  GIF is best used for cartoons, and computer and windows generated graphics.  It is generally not best suited for random or real-life type images.<br />
<br />
2. JPEG - Divides an image into a checkerboard-like series of smaller squares, and uses a mathematical equation (a discrete cosine transform for us mathy types) to approximate the contents of that chunk.  The more chunks, the smaller the chunk and the better the appearance (usually).... but the bigger the filesize.  With JPG, you can choose the amount of compression, and compare the result.  You should make several test saves, and make the file about 3,5000 to 3,900 bytes for an Avatar (TF limits filesize to 4K).  The JPG is best for natual scenes, pictures with not many vertical and horizontal lines (esp. high contrast), and photos.  All JPG is lossy... which means the stored result will NOT be as good as the original.  <br />
<br />
<br />
How to reduce size in general?  If you are using a GIF  (this is generally best for a 65x65 Avatar), then use despeckle to smooth the color transformations.  You can also edit the file manually.... I did this with Floppa21's, Becka's, and Ren's avatars in the Site Feedback threads... this keeps sharp detail, yet (esp. in Ren's Avatar of the &quot;Townsville&quot; icon) reduces the storage drastically... in his case, all the blue was changing from pixel to pixel.  Once I made all the blue the same color value, the size dropped drastically and then easily met the 4K limit.   Becka's Avatar was reduced quite a bit by giving Lime Green hundreds of surrounding pixels.  Then I made the Lime Green transparant, and it appears as the Oval-shaped image in the Site Feedback.  I did something similar for Floppa's &quot;Smug&quot; smiley, though his Avatar was in no danger of exceeding the 4K limit.  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Note:  Always save your original as an  uncompressed 24-bit TIF(&quot;true color&quot;), and edit from that, then save as JPG or GIF when you are done.  If you can do it, a PSD (Photoshop Document) is also good as the reference file (lossless).  A BMP (256 color limit, though)  is OK, if you have no other option.  Don't save &amp; edit from JPEGs, however.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodgers</div><div class="date">Aug 13, 2002, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As you might know from my &quot;computer virgin&quot; thread of a few weeks ago I have no idea what the above stuff means but I do have a picture I want to use as an avatar that needs reducing. It's fairly small already and black and white so I suppose it shouldn't be too difficult - can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pillager</div><div class="date">Aug 13, 2002, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, post it, and I'll do it for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodgers</div><div class="date">Aug 13, 2002, 04:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I cant work out how to get it out of the &quot;my pictures&quot; directory on my computer and onto the reply screen - I'm SUCH a useless b*stard when it comes to these machines - HELP!<br />
<br />
Oh BTW - did you mean post it on the site or email it to you direct?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pillager</div><div class="date">Aug 14, 2002, 02:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To post it in the reply:<br />
<br />
Click 'Post Reply'<br />
Underneath the box in which you write your message, click the 'Browse' button<br />
Select the file from your machine<br />
This will include the picture in your post, and I can take it directly from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodgers</div><div class="date">Aug 15, 2002, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I sure hope this works....hoorah! As you cannsee theres a lot of stuff at the bottom of the picture that could be remved altogether. Also, if it's not possible to get the face AND cigar in then maybe just the face would do. <br />
<br />
Thank for anything you can come up with :D :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to let you know, if you dl it onto your machine and open it, it might have a purple background. This is just to ensure that the transparency works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodgers</div><div class="date">Aug 15, 2002, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow!! Thanks very much - I opened it on my computer and the background has a kind of large checkerboard effect - instead of being a pure white background there are about 2 or 3 grey squares and a couple of white ones. I'll try and use it now to see if they appear on this site too....<br />
<br />
....and they dont!!! Brilliant!!! Thanks VERY much Pillager :goodjob: :goodjob: :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pillager</div><div class="date">Aug 15, 2002, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the checkerboard represents the 'board' behind the drawing - i.e. that that part of the image is transparent.<br />
<br />
No problem - anyone who chooses Terry Thomas as his avatar is worthy of my time. :D<br />
