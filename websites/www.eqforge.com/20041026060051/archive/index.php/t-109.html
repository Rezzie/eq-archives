Well, when I'm playing, say, the Germans, and the Americans manage to build the Piramids, I could conquer Washington, but the people living in that city are still ethnic Americans even though they're part of my empire now. I just can't stand the idea of some fat-*** , hamburger-swallowing, ignorant, sunglass-wearing-when-talking, redneck Ammies enjoying the marvelous Piramids in their city, even if they pay taxes to me.<br />
Does that make me a nazi? Please help me on this one guys!</div></div><hr />

Well, I don't consider calling foreigners &quot;silly&quot; to be nationalistic, do you?<br />
 Would be different if I proposed to chop their heads off though (as many people do during soccer matches BTW)<br />
Just for the record, I liked all Americans I have so far met, I have several friends in Germany, one in Denmark..I suppose you goet the point.<br />
Still, I think think there's nothing wrong with being proud &amp; making some fun of others so now and then, is there? (I wouldn't be offended if people made fun of us)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This sounds like Orwell, palehorse. And I think you are right. I think every country has some 'advantage' over the other country, whether it's political, economical, environmental, meteorological or something else. But, since we have lived a long time under the conditions of our own country, we have got used to them and we like the specific combination of conditions better than those in other countries.<br />

I have the same thaught when I take over civs. Although it doesn't matter at all in the game, it matters to a perfectionist that their empire is being over run by take away junkies, or ppl that think cows are god, or ppl that stretch their neck with rings, or people that put sticks through their ears and nose, or people that kill people with red hair because they must be the devil!
