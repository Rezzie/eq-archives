<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TedG</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2002, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you sure it's the modem and not your ISP disconnecting you? It's been a while since I've used dial-up, but I think that if your ISP sees you as &quot;inactive&quot; (like when you're downloading a large file and not doing anything else for a while) they might disconnect you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2002, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my experience, its usually your ISP that disconnects you, not the modem.  In that case, there's pretty much nothing you can do other than find a better ISP.  I'm not necessarily ruling out a hardware problem, but most disconnects are just your provider freeing up connections for other users.</div></div><hr />

It's the company that provides you access to the Internet.</div></div><hr />

Oh! No thats not it. I had the same ISP (see Im learning:) ) on other computors and there it works fine. It could be the modem itself, the problem is it is buit-in inside the comp. itself.</div></div><hr />

The modem is built-in? Usually, when you get a computer, it comes with a PCI modem. (A card that goes inside a slot on the inside of the computer - which is removable).</div></div><hr />

Hmm.....someone told me the Modem was bulit-in. Maybe he was wrong Ill have to investigate this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Major Guevara</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2002, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I have changed some settings in the modem thing in the control-panel. It said if I had connection problems I should lower the settings in: Reciver-buffert and Transfer-buffert. You think this will help or is it if you have problems whit just the dial-up??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">erix</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2002, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a guess;<br />
Your e-mail program could be set to &quot;disconnect after checking&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Modems suck! :p<br />
But internal ones pre-built in are slightly better, at least they achieve their full download speed.<br />
<br />
1.<br />
Most problems with dial-up modems appear with the initialisation string!<br />
Go to the properties of your modem (START --&gt; properties --&gt; control panel --&gt; modem --&gt; properties). First up should be the general tab, check that your connection ports and the connections speed are ok.<br />
Then go to the setting, the connection settings should be 8, none, 1.<br />
Go to advanced and make sure to select Hardware flow control (RTS/CTS). At the bottom is the initialisation box. Check your manual or look at the online documentation to find out which string has to appear in there. :yeah:<br />
Also go back and select the other button. You could try to play a bit with the slider settings there, but remember not to change everything at once, step by step is the correct way.<br />
<br />
2.<br />
Another possibility is in the Internet Options. Either use Internet Explorer and go to Extras --&gt; Internet Options --&gt; Connections tab or use START --&gt; properties --&gt; control panel --&gt; Internet options --&gt; Connections Tab.<br />
There you should see a list of the ISPs you use (probably only one). Select it and go to properties or settings (whatever it´s name in your language is ;)). At the bottom should be your login data. Select the Advanced button.<br />
There are 2 points there now: <br />
&quot;Disconnect after X minutes of idleness.&quot;<br />
&quot;Disconnect if connection is no longer needed.&quot;<br />
Uncheck both if they are checked.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is an even wider range of causes, but these are the most common.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

Lucky: I have tried this, both the boxes were checked!!!!<br />
:o <br />
Now its just to see if the problem dissapear or not. Thanks for the help everyone!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TedG</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2002, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So it was Internet Explorer all the time! It's all M$'s fault.:mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Major Guevara</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2002, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No that didnt help the problem is still there :cry: <br />
I was think it might be the Driver of the Modem, the old one was installed 6/8 2000.</div></div><hr />
