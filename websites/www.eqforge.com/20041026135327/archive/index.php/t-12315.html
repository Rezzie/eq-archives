<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simon Darkshade</div><div class="date">Dec 17, 2001, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Good afternoon to all our viewers on C-Span, keeping track of politics and events here in our great capital of Suzail. Our regular programming has been interrupted by a government proclamation that the Prime Minister will address the nation in 10 minutes. There is a buzz of activity going around the Palace at the moment, with the guards on high alert and Ministry of War officials rushing all over the place.<br />
<br />
It is thought that Prime Minister Darkshade's address will be in regards to the Spanish situation. There has been no news from Spain for several days now, as the scientists from the SETI Program at the Royal University initiated a blackout of all communications from the continent of the backward Spaniards. <br />
<br />
However, we can inform you that this news increasingly seems to be of a very serious nature, with the Army sailing out of Suzail some months ago, reportedly on regular maneuvers off Germany, and the Northern Fleet leaving its harbour off Sundsvall. Wires from Athens have reported that the Western Fleet and the Grand Battle Fleet are no longer steaming off the coast of Moonshae Island. There are furhter rports, unofficial, and completely unconfirmed at this stage, that several Peacekeeper ICBM units are absent from their silos on Golden Mountain.<br />
<br />
This all adds up to what could be the biggest international crisis since the American war last century!<br />
<br />
And, ... yes, we are now crossing to Elric Halfladd in the Throne Room, where the Prime Minister will address the nation, and answer a few brief questions.<br />
<br />
'Thanks Dan. The Prime Minister is entering the room now, accompanied by Grand Marshal Bhereu and Secretary of War Corosin.'<br />
<br />
&quot;My fellow Cormyrians. It is my most solemn duty to report to you events that have unfolded in the last few hours in Spain. Two hours and fourteen minutes ago, at 2210 local time, the commander of the Cormyrian Armed Forces, Grand Marshal Aran Herath received the unconditional surrender of the last remnants of the Spanish armed forces outside Ciudad Rodrigo. The Spanish civilization has been destroyed by the Cormyrians.<br />
<br />
(gasps of shock and amazement)<br />
<br />
The fact that we were at war itself only eventuated yesterday evening, when Germany and Spain signed the Riga Pact, allegedly against our aggression. I promptly telephoned High Priestess Maria Theresa, and informed her that such action was contrary to our previous agreements, and after an impromptu trade agreement, she dissolved the pact.<br />
<br />
As a result, the craven Spanish Republic had the temerity to declare war on Cormyr. I then ordered the Expeditionary Force, made up of large elements of the Royal Cormyrian Army, Navy and Air Force to preemptively strike against Spain, and to not cease until that nation was destroyed. For too long, Consul Isabella and her nefarious court had insulted and provoked us.<br />
<br />
As part of a massive military exercise due to start next month, we had a large amount of forces in the area - the five Carrier Battle Groups of the Northern Fleet of Admiral Magellan, four Carrier Battle Groups from the Eastern Fleet of Admiral Sashenstar, three Carrier Battle Groups from the Southern Fleet of Admiral Columbus, and the entire Western and Grand Battle Fleets, under Grand Admiral Nelson. Whilst still keeping seven carriers to guard our home waters, some nineteen carriers, sixteen battleships, ten Aegis Cruisers and nine destroyers attacked and destroyed the Spanish fleet.<br />
<br />
The Carrier Air Wings, and the Air Force planes abaord then launched a tremendous strike upon the Spanish continent, and on the city of Riga in Russia. After some twelve hours, and several thousand combat missions later, the Spanish Army and Air Force were no more. <br />
Riga has been blasted off the face of the earth<br />
<br />
That done, Grand Marshal Herath led a lightning ground offensive which occupied every Spanish city, and put down the token resistance. His force, comprising thirty two Marine divisions, twelve artillery divisions equipped with Deathstar Howitzers, twenty three armored divisions and twenty one mechanized Purple Dragon divisons, now stands victorious across Spain. Their nuclear arsenal was destroyed in strikes by B-2 bombers based in Berlin. Four airborne divisions completed the attack by flying in from Germany and occupying Naples, Cunnaxa and Cannae.<br />
<br />
We did not lose a single ship, nor a single soldier on the ground. Our brave fighter pilots flew magnificently, and some eighteen great patriots will not be returning home out of the force of two hundred and fifty.<br />
<br />
As a precaution, I placed our strategic arsenal on the highest alert, and was perepared to strike at the Spanish nuclear weapons facilities if we could not eliminate them fully with conventional forces. Even though our own nation is completely covered by our glorious SDI network, those citizens we liberated from the grasps of the vindictive Isabella could have been attacked by their own former ruler.<br />
She, and her cabinet, have been executed, and a provisional military government established.<br />
<br />
This is an enormous triumph for the great Cormyrian democracy, better even than the blitzkrieg against the Americans. Rejoice, rejoice, rejoice.&quot;<br />
<br />
'Prime Minister! Prime Minister!'<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes Elric?&quot;<br />
<br />
'Was it coincidental that we had hundreds of thousands of men, and most of the navy off Spain before the war started?'<br />
<br />
&quot;Elric, the Riga pact forced our hand. We could not allow the fundamentalist countries of this world, mediocre as they may be compared to our might, to ally against us. If we did not strike now, then the achievement of our glorious destiny would have required so much more sacrifice and blood from our great people. As it is, we are once again, and always VICTORIOUS!<br />
<br />
My people, let us celebrate our triumph. May God bless you all, and God bless Cormyr&quot;<br />
<br />
............<br />
<br />
'The Prime Minister has left the room, with the War Secretary reporting that a thanksgiving service will be held tonight in Michelangelo's Chapel.<br />
That's all from me now, on a most momentous day in Cormyr. Back to you, Dan.'</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simon Darkshade</div><div class="date">Dec 18, 2001, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I'm a big fan of huge naval deployments, and combined arms in general, and yes, it was a one turn war :cool:. I would have had more ships and troops, but am a democracy, so have to watch things so I don't get one unhappy citizen.<br />
<br />
I could have Suzail make a lot of forces (Production 150 and Shakespeares Theatre), but tried this before, and ended up with a whole city of content people and one happy citizen. It just looked ugly.<br />
<br />
I've run similar wars with more paras and separate marine forces, lots more armor, and more bombers, surface craft and cruise missiles, but making do with this army. It's worked twice, against America and Spain, but the AI is very, very easy to defeat. All my invasions are preceded by spy recon, giving me data to tabulate and work out which unit attacks where, and how. This usually gives me masses of reserves, which are also allotted specific targets if necessary. I like to plan my wars properly. After all, proper planning prevents p*ss poor performance:D</div></div><hr />
