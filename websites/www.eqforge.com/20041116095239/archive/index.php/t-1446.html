<br />
I was cruising the web and found a Civ 2 Clone out there called: CIV-EVOLUTION.<br />
<br />
Go to this link:<br />
 http://c-evo.org/ <br />
<br />
Now, I know that we have all been wanting a &quot;Free&quot; download of Civ...so this is as close as I can get for you...<br />
<br />
I downloaded it and I have to say...it's pretty damn good (for free that is!)...<br />
<br />
However, although playable...I am posting it here in the Scenario Creation because it is not even a beta yet...I would also like some assessment from others for the customizability of this game...I have found that the language and graphics are relatively easy to work with...<br />
<br />
I would also like to petition programmers to think about the concept of this game because it has a customizable 'AI' (although I have not figured out how to get one 'AI' package to work, I'll let you know when I do!).<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think!<br />
<br />

But it has excellent potential!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">May 31, 2001, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree CM, <br />
<br />
It is a worthy project and I think that it could do some cool things (aside from being free at the moment). It's a bit complex about the AI modules for the common player, but I think that AI patches for those who are into programming is a neat thing...<br />
<br />
A lot of people can get in on this and I would hope that people would take a look at the potential of the game...<br />
<br />
Also, the absence of sounds might come off a bit uninteresting at first but I think that if there are future versions the code might be added for sounds (although not included in the zip file)...<br />
<br />
Let me know any other things you think about this...<br />

<br />
I have to say...if I could get the AI thing to work right this would outright be civilization...YES, I am actually playing it...I might even convert a modpack for it...<br />
