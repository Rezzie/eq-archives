I will create a special one if there are enough who wnat to. I know there is a scenario converting program, but it never worked for me so, let me know!<br />

<br />
I want you to know in advance I think it is a wonderful idea...however, it would be fair to warn you that I've been unsuccessful as yet to create the quality of scenario I would like to for ToT...several insurmountable problems are usually encounted:<br />
<br />
1) Animation graphics are uncontrollable, <br />
   (recently, I've found a way around this)<br />
2) Complexity of the Rules.txt<br />
   (I'm working on breaking it down as I   write this)<br />
3) Getting appropriate .txt and .gif files to actuate with the program<br />
   (this is the worst one and it pisses me off personally)<br />
4) Learning the macro-language, almost the same as C2Gold but sometimes, I've noticed that the events.txt file is very unstable<br />
<br />
Otherwise, &quot;knock yourself out&quot; is the expression in America, meaning if you think can do it, by all means, give it a try. <br />
<br />
If I can get my Lunar Modpack converted, in the way that I think I can...I might be able to convert up to 9 or 10 more mods/scenarios more easily by the end of this summer. However, I will NOT do it if I cannot make them with the same quality as previous versions of civ.<br />
<br />
Let me know what you think.<br />
