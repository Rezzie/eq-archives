<br />
1) Observe all CFC rules! This is the most important tip because violating this can eventually get you banned :eek:<br />
<br />
2) Visit the 'HOWTO: Get the best help for your problem' thread stickied towards the top of this forum. Use this whenever you are having computer problems and need assistance. There are also several HOWTOs that can be found via that thread. Here is a link (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=24975)<br />
<br />
3) Vote! This forum contains several polls and new polls appear every week. Vote and share your opinions.<br />
<br />
4) Open a new thread if you stumbled upon something interesting. If you have found a news story pertaining to computers and you want to share your opinions on it or just share it with the forum, go ahead and open a new thread.<br />
<br />
5) Don't be afraid to ask even if you feel you have a stupid question.<br />
<br />
And last but not least, feel free to open a new quiz/game type thread if you feel it will gain interest.<br />
<br />
Here are some examples from past quiz games: <br />
<br />
Cumulative Computer Quiz #1 (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=24956)<br />
Cumulative 48-hour Computer Trivia (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=26828)<br />

Even newbies and non-techies.  Especially newer and computer-challenged folks!  Don't be worried about the technical sounding stuff some of us carry on about... PhD in Computer Science is not necessary for admission :D, and even users with MS Internet Exploder browsers are welcome to post here (j/k  :lol: ).</div></div><hr />
