I can't imagine a person not paying attention to the AI!!! But then again I can't imagine a person letting the AI get so big and advanced that it can make NUKES!!!<br />

When I started playing multiplayer sessions I had read a huge number of strategies about how to play civ. Because of that my early game got REALLY good, so I will beat most people if I meet them early. However. Because of a strange twist in my incomprehensable cerebral nerves, I really suck when it comes to the mid-game (just after the discovery of invention and just before the discovery of industrialization, IMO)<br />
So, there I was: Deity of the huge Aztec empire, superior in each and every aspect of the game and then little by little it started to fade into a hopeless pool of misery. At that point I met my human opponent..... http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/cry.gif</div></div><hr />
