<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weimar_republic</div><div class="date">Apr 12, 2001, 09:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eighteen-Seventy-Five is a scenario by Weimar Republic. Its my first scenario, and I hope it will be a spring board for bigger, and better ones.<br />
<br />
This scenario is like no other before... ever tried some historical scenarios, its 1772 and you can be: FRANCE! RUSSIA! PRUSSIA! Or Poland... ever want to pick Poland to prove that you can take a crappy nation and conquer the world? If not, you probably will not like this scenario that much, but you never know. This scenario tries to stress your ability to keep a strong economy going. Russia, for example, starts off with an economy that, even with taxes to Max, you will have a tough time making it through and paying for all improvements. Turkey, on the other hand, will NOT have enough money to run itself, now there's a challenge. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Turkey all need improvement in order to pose a real threat. France, Britain and Germany all need to improve their economies to the max, and make all squares railed and farmed. On the other hand, you can give it a shot and try to conquer the world {or Europe anyway}<br />
<br />
There are no 'events' as this scenario is NOT intended to re-create history. But advances and the improvements are events within themselves. Examples are: the advent of socialism and communism. Aging of Albert Einstein. And other such things. <br />
<br />
Each nation has &quot;National&quot; units. Like Russian Infantry. There is also, after certain advances, generic units that are upgrades. Light, Medium, and Heavy infantry for example. &quot;German Infantry&quot; may fall between Light and Medium Infantry in strength. So in order for Russia to make clear advances, they should make Medium Infantries. This represents how technology averages out nations in the end.<br />
<br />
Air units will also come available , and everything truly advanced before 1933, when the scenario ends. The dates are 1875-1933 with 4 turns a year {I hope I can create this} 1875 cause that is a good starting date, and 1933 cause that's when Hitler rose to power.<br />
<br />
Nations CAN switch governments. This MAY be in the events after all. For example: Russia will bet communism government advance in 1917. The basic chart is:<br />
Name-Starts with-Can get<br />
Germany-Republic-Democracy/Fundamentalist {I have the Fascist patch}<br />
France-Republic-Democracy/Communist/Fascist<br />
England-Republic-Democracy<br />
Austria-Monarchy-Republic/Communist<br />
Italy-Monarchy-Republic/Communist/Fascist<br />
Russia-Monarchy or Despotism-Monarchy/Communist<br />
Turkey-Monarchy or Despotism-Monarchy<br />
<br />
This is about all I know for now. More later. Scenario is in development, it will be a month about before I am truly done. I may release a beta version before then.<br />
