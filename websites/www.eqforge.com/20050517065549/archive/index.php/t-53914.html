<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">May 21, 2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This thread will house the discussion regarding general goals for our cities, as it becomes less and less feasible to poll build queues.<br />
<br />
This is what I propose for the first classifications:<br />
<br />
Noshuret<br />
<br />
Citadel, though it will produce a settler here and there when needed.<br />
<br />
Gorina<br />
<br />
Metropolis, though it will also produce one or two more settlers.<br />
<br />
Nar Shadaa<br />
<br />
worker/settler factory, though it will need some irrigation before it can effectively produce settlers.  For the time being, it is responsible for workers.<br />
<br />
Penguinadua<br />
<br />
Settler factory.  Because of its proximity to the capital, it will be switched to a metropolis or citadel once we have another city that can replace it as a settler factory.<br />
<br />
I will poll this issue sometime between the next two turn chats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">May 21, 2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The current classifications are:<br />
<br />
Settler/worker factory<br />
<br />
This category will build nothing but settlers and units to escort them.  When needed it will also build workers.  These should be low production/high growth cities, and in some cases may need to construct a granary before being set on their 'path'.<br />
<br />
Metropolis<br />
<br />
The primary purpose of these cities will be to generate income, culture and science.  They may also be used to construct wonders, and in times of need, units.  This category will normally contain cities with good growth potential and good production.  They will also generally receive the most attention from our workers.<br />
<br />
Citadel<br />
<br />
The primary purpose of these cities will be to produce trained military units.  A barracks will be one of the first things constructed, and then just enough other buildings to maintain order.  After that, they will almost exclusively produce troops.  Ideal candidates will be cities with mediocre to low growth potential but the ability to produce a good number of shields with only a small population.<br />
<br />
Port<br />
<br />
The purpose of these cities will be to generate trade and science income, allow foreign trade via a harbor, and produce whatever naval vessels we need.  They should build a harbor relatively early on, and then focus on markets and libraries while building enough happiness improvements to maintain order.  These cities will obviously be coastal, with decent production capabilities and growth.  They should be optimized to have as many citizens as possible working the coastal squares, as these produce extra income.<br />
<br />
Border town<br />
<br />
These cities are those resting on a border with another civilization.  They will normally produce several cultural buildings early on, city walls, a barracks, and then can be switched to the Settler/worker factory classification.  They will serve mainly as upgrade points rather than troop production centers due to the fact that they will often experience high corruption.</div></div><hr />

It need be until we find a better one (Wheat Fish?). Then perhaps a metropolis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">May 21, 2003, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with your proposals. You have picked the most appropriate task for each city.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 22, 2003, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stuck - by the time we DO settle Wheatfish, we won't need any more settler factories. Also, I'd still like to see more workers, especially roading to the east to the new city sites - and a settler in Noshuret instead of a temple. If there's unhappiness, then increase the lux slider up one temporarily.</div></div><hr />
