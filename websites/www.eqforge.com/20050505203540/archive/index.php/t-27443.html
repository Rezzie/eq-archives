<br />
I'm about 900AD, I've have had an army win a battle and I've got one city building the Heroic Epic, I just had an opponent complete a Wonder I was building and was trying to switch the production to Military Academy, but it's not on the list. The city in question is my capital and has a barracks already. Since I'm able to build the Heroic Epic, there's proof I've had an army win a battle, what am I missing???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jul 18, 2002, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You cannot build the Military Academy until AFTER you have researched the &quot;Military Tradition&quot; tech that also enables Cavalry. The victorious army is just one of the prerequisites for the MA.<br />
<br />
<br />
If pressed to switch your accumulated wonder shields to something before losing them, then analyse your choices:<br />
<br />
If there is another Great Wonder that you could use, then switch your shields there before building small wonders like the Heroic Epic. Small wonders are always available to you but you are in a &quot;get there first&quot; race for Great Wonders with all the other CIVs.<br />
F7 can reveal the other wonders being built by known civs.<br />
<br />
If you have no other Great Wonder choices, and these shields are in your capital, then perhaps your best option would be to switch the Heroic epic shields to apply to something else (or a temporary copy of your palace) and then convert the shields in your capital to apply to the HE once it is freed up by the first move.</div></div><hr />

I didn't really want the other available Wonder (Copernicus), but it's better than wasting 200+ shields!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirJethro</div><div class="date">Jul 29, 2002, 09:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are there any pre-reqs to the Hero Epic?  In my last game, I couldn't build Hero Epic until the very end (after I'd wiped out everybody).  I'd already had the miltary academy for at least 100 years.<br />
<br />
Does it have anything to do with actually having to successfully enter a city or just successfully defeat an opponent?  For example, I usually use the Army to defeat the stronger defenders, and then use individual units to clean up.  Usually the individual units actually take the city.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Aug 01, 2002, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yup, that's all it takes, so chances are you have already had an army, but never won a battle with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbaws</div><div class="date">Sep 03, 2002, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I once built the heroic epic without noticing. Kept trying to build it and never could. Finally noticed it in my capital, that was a big d'oh moment.</div></div><hr />
