<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Apr 01, 2001, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
You know this question came to mind today as I checked my email, &quot;How long will Civ2 endure?&quot; I can say that I know there is a small following for Civ1 that has not died, you can bet that TTG would tell you that. Civ1 came on the scene in what, 1989-90 and roughly a little more than ten years later people are still playing it.<br />
<br />
Here's the deal: People are still making mods and scenarios for Civ2...how long will that last? I think scenario/modpack authors are getting really good now (let's face it, imagine if you could have downloaded some of the stuff you've seen here lately in 1996!).<br />
<br />
This is a question I have because CivIII will probably come out this year, and also because I just found a copy of the Classic Civ 2 for sale in Wal-Mart and K-Mart for under $10 dollars. <br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />

Certain games are just irreplacible.  Even when CivIII arrives, and it has many new features, people will still pop in their CivII cds and play for old time sake.</div></div><hr />

If it's very hard to make mods and scenarios in Civ III, most builders will stick to Civ II. I do think lots of players are going to leave Civ II and begin Civ III.<br />

It is the nature of software. If civ-3 is a bust like CTP or not as good for scenarios like tot it will last a lot longer, but the franchise will die. Thirty years ago a vintage boardwargame named Panzerblitz was first put out, and today nobody even remembers it. We all love the old NES games, but how often do you really play them anymore? Civ-2 will allways be special to us, but how will people feel ten years from now? Remember how cool Dragon Warrior One was? That was ten years ago. Do you still think it's such a great game now? Or Mario Bros, Zelda and all the rest? We loved them, but we are not reaching for them much these days, so, sadly civ-2 will also meet this fate.<br />

I don't think they can improve it with civ3.Anything in Civ2 you don't like..you change.If Civ3 is a beefed up version of civ2 it will fail miserably.Its all about game play.<br />
<br />
Customization gives Civ2 an endless life.For me anyway.</div></div><hr />

It is as much a fortune telling question as it is a probability question. Many things about the games we play make them fun. Civ2 certainly is special, and I have several versions of Civ. I don't have the CTP games, but I do have ToT and hardly play it...I have to admit, I play FW most of the time now, eventhough I have MGE. I play all of my modpacks on Classic Civ2 using the MODPACK MANAGER! <br />
<br />
I will be a die hard, I can tell you that right now. I will setup my own website before I let Civ2 die, you can bet on that. But I totally and completely look forward to Civ III with great anticipation, and hope that it will satisfy the ultimate quest of civers and mine (whatever it is that I am feeling right now). <br />

Let us pray. <br />

Amen.<br />

On that I am sure you are absolutely right..it stands to reason, and the fact that this is essentially the only site that has anything of quality about Civ 1...and I would venture to say everything on this site about Civ 1 is the absolute best coverage on the net that I've seen.<br />

Actually FW does not require the CD when its used so it will live forever. MGE requires a CD (by the way, the FW CD is sufficient to make MGE run). Maybe if we transplant the entire CD onto a zip disk or compact flash, we'll be able to get pass the CD problem.<br />
<br />
I think I will be sticking to CIV2 for as long as its around - it will probably be impossible to do CivIII scenarios anyway, that's one of the reasons why TOT did not uproot CivII.</div></div><hr />

Firaxis said scenario designers can use 2D graphics for units. They are also exploring the possibility of a conversion program would make Civ2 scenarios compatible with Civ3. <br />

For those who, let's say-- haven't the ability to upgrade right away, Civ II would still be alive. For existing scenario authors, they could start converting their scenarios to Civ III right away further encouraging people to upgrade because they can still play their favorite scenario, that now probably has a &quot;little more kick&quot; to it.<br />
<br />
It is my opinion that all civ players for the most part (except TTG) will upgrade to civ III if it is as big of a hit as expected (I'm not sure whether &quot;if&quot; even applies anymore). I'm getting Civ III as soon as it comes out.<br />

i'm a little curious, how you scenario designers did feel about the ease to develop scenario in Civ2 ?<br />
I mean, how would you rate Microprose effort to support scenario design ?<br />
for example on a 1-5 scale, which could be:<br />
1=best effort: everything well documented,no hidden info,...<br />
3=quite average: need to develop extra utilities, lack of documentation, ...<br />
5=very poor: ...<br />

I think I will keep playing civ2 after civ3 is released, just because of the great scenario's I did download. Unless ofcourse there is a way to play the scenario's in civ3. <br />
<br />
I do not think civ2 will die. Not for me. I do have TOT, call to power, civ2 and fantastic worlds and I am still playing civ1 occasionally and also colonization.</div></div><hr />
