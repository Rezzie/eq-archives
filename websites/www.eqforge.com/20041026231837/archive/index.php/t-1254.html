<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">engineer</div><div class="date">Jan 16, 2001, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I've just started experimenting with changing files and am attempting to start making new scenarios soon. I just wanted some basic advice on what kind of editors and editing techniques I should use. <br />
I have PSP for the gif files, tribeEditor and the basic map editor. I really wanted to know the best why of editing the text files - is it fine to just dive in and edit the properties or are there tricks I should be aware of?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any guides/ tips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Jan 16, 2001, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually there is a Rules.txt editor out there somewhere but I never use it...If you are asking how you should begin to learn how to change these files I say experiment with some of the code a little at a time. <br />
<br />
Not because that is what I did, but because you may want to develop some of your technique...what's faster for me may be something that slows you down...and so on. <br />
<br />
I say start with units. Change some of the properties of units, save it, and then start the game and go into to cheat mode and see how you like it. If you don't like it, write down with a note to yourself but don't forget what it was you didn't like. It turns out that something that you never thought you would use is exactly what you need in another scenario!<br />
<br />
(Go into cheat mode and select create unit for the unit you just changed, it's the fastest way to test it).<br />
<br />
In the rules.txt there is a little blurb in the file before each section that tells you about the programming of each parameter, this more or less explains how to change the parameters, but not really how to make certain things happen...<br />
<br />
If you have any questions about how to do specific things, by all means write them here...I am sure myself, Stephan the Great, Prometeus or many others would be more than happy to offer you the solution...<br />

I sometimes use the one that comes with Fantastic Worlds, but it is so buggy and only messes everything up.<br />
<br />
I sometimes lose the overview over what I am doing, especially when assigning techs and units. That is why I am going to prevent this for my next scenarios. For example, I write a list of Units, technologies and perhaps also city improvements.<br />
In general, a list of units should look like this:<br />
<br />
MACEDONIANS<br />
1. Macedonian Phalanx<br />
2. Peltasts<br />
3. Prodromoi<br />
4. Archers<br />
5. Mercenaries<br />
6. Pioneers<br />
7. Maced. Cavalry<br />
8. Thessalians<br />
9. Light Infantry<br />
10. Strategos<br />
11. Alexander<br />
12. Pezhetairs<br />
13. Siege Tower<br />
14. Catapult<br />
15. Trireme<br />
16. Transport<br />
17. Hoplites<br />
18. Hypaspists<br />
19. Somatophylax (Guards)<br />
20. Parmenion<br />
<br />
PERSIANS<br />
21. Bactrians<br />
22. Cataphracts<br />
23. Mounted Archers<br />
24. Scythians<br />
25. Chariots<br />
26. Scythian Chariots<br />
27. Greeks<br />
28. Melophoroi<br />
29. Persians<br />
30. Pasti<br />
31. Rshtika<br />
32. Thanuviya<br />
33. Ushabari<br />
34. Elephants<br />
35. Slinges<br />
36. Garrison<br />
37. General<br />
38. Immortals<br />
39. Ballista (Tyros)<br />
40. Fortress<br />
41. Phoenecian Galley<br />
42. Cilician Galley<br />
43. Memnon<br />
<br />
SCYTHO-BACTRIANS<br />
44. Scythians<br />
45. Sacans<br />
46. Massagets<br />
47. Bessos<br />
48. Spitamenes<br />
49. Sogdians<br />
50. Chorasmians<br />
<br />
INDIANS<br />
51. Elephants<br />
52. Pikemen<br />
53. Chariots<br />
54. Chariot Archers<br />
55. Infantry<br />
56. Armored Chariots<br />
57. Elephant Archers<br />
58. Light Cavalry<br />
59. Heavy Cavalry<br />
60. Poros<br />

<br />
Then I try to write the techs beside them (which is why I usually do it on paper).<br />
<br />
What I would advise you, however, would be the same thing I did when I first built a scenario having civ-specific units and techs.<br />
<br />
I had it based on the Mediterranean map. It had 7 Civs, Persians, Egyptians, Athenians, Spartans, Etruscans, Carthaginians, but I can't remember which one was the 7th one (maybe Celts). I did it very simple. I viewed the instructions on editing the specific sections that is provided with the rules file. I also downloaded a file I found on &quot;Ghost Technologies&quot; (You can find a large number on instruction and hint files on editing the Rules.txt all over the net).<br />
<br />
Then I built the scenario. I had the settlers build the units with all civs via cheat mode, did a little terrain work etc. etc. Then, I gave the Egyptians a special technology. I saved the game and opened the file rules.txt and named the tech &quot;Egyptian Tech&quot; and gave them a unit, &quot;Egyptian Infantry&quot;. Prerequisite for this Unit was &quot;Egyptian Tech&quot;. I changed the prerequisites for the &quot;Egyptian Tech&quot; No, No (Important!), saved the file, relaunched the scen - et voila! The Egyyptians had their very own Tech with their very own unit!<br />
<br />
Something I would advise you is to build the cities before editing the rules file, because if your settlers need a specific tech (or they don't exist at all) it would be a bit complicated.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions, write them here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">engineer</div><div class="date">Feb 20, 2001, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly, thanks a lot for the replies, esp on creating civ-specific units - I'll definitely be trying that.<br />
<br />
Another question: I can edit the txt files and units.gif file no problem, however it seems I can't edit the city, cities or icons gif files. I'm using classic civ2 2.42. Is there something else I should be doing or is it just because of the version? I've just been copying and pasting just like on units file.<br />
<br />
Plus I have the facsist patch and that has an altered icons file which works fine.<br />
<br />
Any help greatly appreciated http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Feb 23, 2001, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm just a starter, too. I've almost finished my first modpack (Dutch Modpack) and I'm workin on scenarios about the 80-year war. (some advertising here)<br />
<br />
I just studied some altered files of modpacks I liked, read the things that are in it, started writing down my ideas, and finally just experimented. It worked out fine.<br />
<br />
For the graphics, I use PSP now. But at first I couldn't do anything because I only had paint. When I create or edit a graphic, I load it into paint, change it and load it in to PSP to save it as the correct .gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">engineer</div><div class="date">Feb 23, 2001, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yeah, I've got PSP too and it's great for copying and pasting the units gifs but still has no help/ effect on cities and icons gif files.<br />
<br />
Something I've seen in altered cities and icons files is the altered section is often on the bright purple background - does this really make any difference? Is this why the game crashes for alterations made directly into the gif file?<br />
<br />
I don't know, I'm at a loss http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/frown.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Feb 25, 2001, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The simplest way to make your own city and other picture files is to not use gif files at all. Use the bmp versions that come in some of the scenarios with FW as you base files and then edit them (or just download some scenarios). Don't start any files from scratch but use the existing color schemes. Then you can use the paint program that comes with windows exclusively. <br />
<br />
Civ2 accepts bmp files as well as gif files. The bmp files may seem bigger but after they are zipped, it makes no differentce. This way, there is no need to copy things back and forth between psp and paint. The only thing that absolutely needs to remain as a gif is the title.gif. <br />
<br />
Also, I have some useful stuff in my first and second tips that relate to creating units, do have a look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">engineer</div><div class="date">Mar 23, 2001, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi guys I'm back again with another question. I'm making a fantasy scenario which is going pretty good apart from one aspect. <br />
<br />
I have a tribe called Gelfs and they have a specific tech: Gelf tech. With this tech comes Gelf warrior att 3/ def 1/ mov 1. However in the city change box it doesn't register, you can just see the ordinary warrior unit att 1/ def 1/ mov 1.<br />
<br />
I've read how some units get replaced if a better unit is available but in this case the inferior unit (warrior) seems to be replacing the advanced unit (Gelf warrior).<br />
<br />
Can anyone suggest solutions/ errors on my part?? <br />
<br />
Thankyou</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Mar 24, 2001, 12:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is probably to do with the knight/musketeer problem. You should not use these two slots at all.<br />
<br />
The other thing to note is that the AI makes only four (or more if some are equivalent) land fighting units - best attack and best defence for one and two(or more) move allowance.</div></div><hr />
