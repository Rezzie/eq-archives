<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Apr 20, 2003, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what have you changed, bootstoots? can you go back and make all the changes in bold font?<br />
<br />
It is harder to read without indentation. Normally notepad or some other program is used. If you do it in notepad, code: will show up at the top and you have to put in manual line breaks in to keep it from extending way out to the right.<br />
<br />
So are there any changes? Or are you just posting the original?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">Apr 21, 2003, 05:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In notepad use tabs and/or spaces to indent the sub-index lines. I usually put a blank line between each item to make it easier to read and follow as well. It should look similar to this when you're done:<br />

<br />
   1. Sub item/clarifier to A. Nolo ipsum factor CivFanatic<br />

<br />
I just noticed the problem. You used [quote ] tags instead of [code ] tags. Quote won't retain spacing. Code will present what you put in exactly how you want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Apr 21, 2003, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem corrected.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">Apr 21, 2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ah, and the idea was to delete it all and then work on it DURING gameplay... so all non-needed laws are thrown out ;-)<br />
<br />
i wont vote on any COL before the game starts... the only thing i would vote upon would be the procedures about changing and adding laws :-P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I might wait until the discussion on executive and judicial reorganization is done, though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2003, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd vote against it. The object of cleaning the slate is to remove the large burden of over-legislation. We should only be enacting rules that are proven to be needed. We have a much more mature populace and simply do not need all of this if we can maintain a cooperative environment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2003, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's going to make sure that we maintain a cooperative environment if we don't have all this legislation?  Do you have a suggestion for a new CoL?  If you do, and it's better than this, I would gladly support it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">Apr 24, 2003, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Deja vu. We had this exact conversation in demogame 1. At that time it was me arguing for legislation and donsig arguing against it. How the worm has turned! :lol:<br />
<br />
I'm all for laws and standards but keep them simple and only implement the ones that are critical. Give cooperation a chance - we gave it the shaft in DG1.</div></div><hr />
