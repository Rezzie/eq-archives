Why aren't you making Demogame for Civ2?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Jan 08, 2004, 03:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the demogame for Civ II.  It just happenes to be the third installment of it.<br />
<br />
However, this game is almost finished and it doesn't look like another one will be started due to the lack of regular players.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Jan 09, 2004, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I suppose it's up to DoM, as he's moderator, but maybe it would be worth seeing how many people would be interested to start again. If it's not many, we can forget it. People can do a bit of canvassing in other places where they are known well eg CivIII demogame site, Succession games, other Civ sites? Am I right in thinking there aren't a lot of CivII demogames going. I know the one at GC ground to a halt because it was multiplayer, and it was getting impossible arranging times to play.</div></div><hr />

Same with me :)</div></div><hr />

As the game becomes increasingly &quot;in hand&quot;, we may want to shift gears, speed the action &amp; draw to a conclusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Jan 09, 2004, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If we can get enough players, we can have another one.  The thing I am trying to avoidis having 5 or 6 players and then have most of them get bored with the game half way through and leave it to one or two people to basically play out a succession game.<br />
<br />
That's what this one became at the end when the core players we had just stopped playing.</div></div><hr />
