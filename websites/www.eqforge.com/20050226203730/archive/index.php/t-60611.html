The infrastructure is overall much better here than in Hell, in particular we already have a rail network.<br />
<br />
Bapedi: Temple, marketplace. Needs irrigation on the shielded grassland square SW of the city ASAP.<br />
Zimbabwe: Engineer, harbor, temple, aqueduct, marketplace<br />
Ulundi: Needs irrigation. Temple, marketplace, aqueduct. Engineers later.<br />
Hlobane: Shouldn't build engineer until it is a size 4+ city. So build temple, marketplace. Maybe cavalry if we want military units.<br />
Intombe: Can become big. Engineer, temple, aqueduct, marketplace.<br />
Isandhlwana: Can become big. Engineer, temple, aqueduct. Railroad needed to Intombe ASAP. May want to move cavalry west if we decide to attack the Indians, otherwise it's useful here to attack the Aztecs. Rehome at least one cavalry (not the one from Dou !!) here.<br />
<br />
The generic build queue looks like the Hell queue: Harbor, temple, marketplace, aqueduct but the list above only includes what's needed ASAP. It would be nice to focus on getting one big city here, probably Intombe. This means rush buying lots of stuff there.<br />
<br />
One important question is if we should build more cavalry, especially if we decide to attack the Indians.<br />
<br />
Input please !<br />
<br />
EDIT: We should also capture Tlaxcala. See the Woodstock Status Report (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=60620) for details.</div></div><hr />

If we capture Tlax though and get that rail, we could improve Africa and send in units from Coresux.</div></div><hr />
