This deity level game had special challenges, but with Mounted Warriors, nearly anything is possible! <br />

I ended up with the same result, although with a very different game strategy. My game write-up should be finished tomorrow, and I hope you'll be interested in reading it. :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

You are very lucky in keeping Kiev for so many years. Was your culture higher than the Russians at that point? In my conquest I destroyed it, it was too close to Moscow. I captured St. Peterberg for Sun Tzu's Art of War in the city, but it flipped back to the Russians only 3 turns later before I had to re-capture it after the downfall of Moscow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I captured Kiev in 10AD, I also captured several catapults. As a cease-fire had been declared, I disbanded the catapults, force-rushing the temple while Kiev was still in resistance. I parked my remaining forces there to heal, and resistance ended the next turn. Then I rushed other cultural improvements. <br />

1670AD? Sheesh. Steam in 1265? I was Flight and Radio short of the modern era in 1265 and had AI's building ship parts already. I find it fascinating how some players' AI's were so much slower with the research. Mine hit modern era well before 1000AD, and one of them had 5 parts built and the other 5 underway at about 1350AD. There was no way my game could have lasted to 1600.<br />
<br />
Congrats on the win, and nice campaign there vs Russia. :goodjob:<br />

I have been often amazed how different games can be. In your game, with Russia having such a vast empire, and being scientific, they may have been pushing the technology envelope. <br />
<br />
Who knows? Other players have reported that the Romans were wiped out, while in my game they were a strong contender until the end.</div></div><hr />

I analysed the trade situation as of 1000 AD. Basically, no one could afford to go to war with the Iroquois. If they did declare before the trade agreement expired, then their reputation would be affected; and if they waited for the end of the trade agreement, I would be prepared to renegotiate or at least anticipate any breakdown in diplomatic relations. Everybody's making a buck. <br />
