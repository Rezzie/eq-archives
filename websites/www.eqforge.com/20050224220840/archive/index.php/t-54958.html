<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Jun 02, 2003, 08:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, the Ministry would like to thank the previous Minister for leaving our science in such a good position.<br />
<br />
Creating a detailed plan like this is tough to do in advance because the situation can change every turn and even mid-turn, but here goes nothing!  Sorry this is so long but I tried to be as complete and thorough as possible in describing what needs to be done and why.<br />
<br />
This plan takes advantage of an opportunity to get 4 additional techs by 720ad (while still celebrating! :D )  There’s a lot of micromanagement here, but it’s just for the next couple turns.  It won’t be like this all month, honest! ;)  <br />
<br />
Research Path<br />
Once banking is complete, we will have the prerequisites for Navigation, The Wheel, Medicine, Feudalism, and Economics.  The science ministry would greatly appreciate it if the president would continue to list the available research choices when tech decisions are made so that we can ensure the accuracy of future predictions of hidden techs.<br />
<br />
Based on the most recent poll, our next priorities after Banking are Medicine, followed by Bridge Building.  The science ministry advises that we trade technologies with the Indians to acquire the Bridge Building prerequisite, Iron Working, in the very near future.  It would be extremely wasteful to research something that has been learned elsewhere<br />
<br />
Since we do not have the caravans to build Shake’s right now (and Newton is a higher priority) the Science ministry recommends that we research Bridge Building before Medicine because its benefits (more trade!) can be realized sooner.<br />
<br />
If we acquire Iron Working then learn Bridge Building after Banking, Medicine will not be presented as a choice the next time.  Therefore, the Science ministry also recommends that we trade with the Indians for The Wheel, a prerequisite for Engineering.  Getting this additional tech would put Medicine back onto our list of available techs to research after Bridge Building.<br />
<br />
Because the Indians have the GL, they will get most techs we have before long, so there is little reason to withhold techs they want.  Give them whatever techs they demand when the emissary is sent but not Theory of Gravity, and then trade techs with them, taking Iron Working first.  If that trade is successful, then try to trade for the Wheel.  Don’t trade for anything else.  (They’ll probably be Worshipful if we do this, so you can try to get updated maps, but only after the tech trades.)<br />
<br />
However, the Science ministry also recommends that the following guidelines be followed regarding the technology exchange to maximize our benefits.  Contact the Indians before delivering the Caravan that turn. (See section on caravans for more info.) Trading for techs will increase our research cost.  Because our deliveries are close to or at the maximum payout (2/3 of total research cost) we want to make the caravan deliveries AFTER the research cost has increased so that our caravan delivery bonuses can also be higher.  <br />
<br />
Before we select any research after Bridge Building and Medicine note that the discovery of Navigation will reduce our trade delivery bonuses by HALF.  Once we research navigation, the delivery payment for these will likely drop below the maximum except at great distance.  The science ministry believes it would be worth delaying the research of Navigation for a couple techs.  .  I humbly suggest the next round of turns end before completing research on Medicine, so that the Science ministry will have time to conduct more research on this issue.<br />
<br />
Delivery of Caravans<br />
We currently have 195 beakers towards the advance Banking.  If we keep the current setting of one Einstein in Doughnutia and 0% science we will have 8 more, giving 203 beakers.  With a 12 population colossus/trade city (39 arrows) we should be able to get close to the max payment on our demanded, foreign, overseas deliveries at decent distances.  <br />
<br />
Note:  Before delivering trade during these turns, maximize the trade in the source city (and the destination, if it is internal).  I.e., before delivering a Doughnutia caravan, put the Einsteins to work in the ocean (you can put him back to Einstein after delivering the camel).  <br />
<br />
After getting the necessary techs from the Indians in 680ad, we should deliver the Hides to Ulundi because that unit is already on foreign land, and is thus more vulnerable.  With trade maximized in Doughnutia, this caravan should net us around 430-440 gold + beakers.  <br />
<br />
The addition of Iron Working and The Wheel will increase our tech requirements to nearly 700 beakers.  After trading techs with the Indians, determine this amount (by eliminating all Einsteins and setting the tax rate to 0 – the number of turns listed is equal to the beakers required).<br />
<br />
If the payment on the Ulundi delivery is more than about 400g – which I am confident it will be, then I STRONGLY recommend we do not deliver any more caravans during that turn.  If we deliver more, most of the delivery bonus beakers will be wasted, something the Science ministry cannot condone.  More specifically, do not deliver any more goods until we have learned the current advance and get a new beaker-bucket to fill again.  Do not deliver the Copper to Dou. Do not deliver the Dye to Tenochtitlan…yet.<br />
<br />
Once the beads caravan is delivered, calculate the new amount of beakers accumulated – adding 203 (assuming one Einstein) already learned plus the delivery bonus.  Then subtract this amount from the total beakers required to determine the remaining beakers necessary. Then modify the tax rate and hire enough Einsteins to ensure we have enough science to learn banking the next turn.  It is imperative that we complete Banking this turn so that more deliveries can be made the next turn.  If you’re not sure, set the rate on the high side, to make sure the tech is completed.  We should be able to afford to reduce the gold rate at this point because we will be getting over 1000 gold from trade deliveries.  With a delivery bonus of ~430, we will probably need around 70b more.  This can be done with a modest science rate of around 20% (with possibly a few extra einsteins in Dou to put us over the top).  Check the Trade Advisor (F5) to ensure the total beakers exceeds the needed number for completing Banking.<br />
<br />
The Ulundi beads delivery, combined with adjustments before ending the 680ad turn must be enough to complete Banking going into the next turn. Select Bridge Building as the next tech, and then do the following on the next turn.<br />
<br />
Assuming it is still demanded by Dou, deliver the VM Copper caravan to Doughnutia.  Based on the current size of VM, this caravan should give around 150g because it’s demanded and relatively long distance, even though it is same civ/same continent. If VM is still growing by celebration (recommended), the bonus will be slightly larger.  Again, make sure you maximize trade arrows in both cities  before delivering the caravan.  Make sure there are no Eins in Dou.  Put the VM workers on the Gold, and the Silk (you’ll have to temporarily move a worker In Ipec to do this) then put the rest on ocean.  Deliver the caravan to Doughnutia, and then move the workers back where they belong.<br />
<br />
Next, deliver the Dye caravan to Tenochtitlan (assuming it is still demanded there).  This city is much farther away than Ulundi, so this one will definitely be for the max payment.  With Banking added to our learned techs, our beaker cost will go up to probably around 725b.  This would give us a max delivery payment of ~480.  With the delivery of both the Dye caravan and the Copper caravan, we should be close enough to reaching our total for the next tech that we can complete it on the following turn as well (I’m guessing ~30% science with possibly some extra Einsteins in Dou.  If celebrations are still continuing at this time, it is possible we will need a gold deficit for one turn.)<br />
<br />
The third SSC caravan is several turns away from its destination in India, so I will not address it specifically here.  However, when we close to delivering it, the same general guidelines should apply –it will generate the max payment (2/3 of total tech cost) so don’t deliver it if many beakers will be lost.  The Science ministry suggests that the third Dou caravan be delivered to one of the smaller of the demanding Indian cities (Bombay?).  The distance is such that the payment will be maxed out (as long as we don’t learn Navigation or Invention).  Save the larger demanding city for later when some of the restrictions on payout have kicked in.<br />
<br />
Spending Priorties<br />
Much of the gold received from trade deliveries will be available for use on domestic improvements, however some of the gold received from the Ulundi Beads delivery should go towards completing the University in Doughnutia immediately – do not partial rush buy it…buy the whole thing.  Doughnutia’s Hides supply has opened back up, so we should immediately rush a hides caravan once the university is complete.  Another boat will be needed sometime thereafter to get it to India for yet another big fat gold and beaker payment!<br />
<br />
Doughnutia should produce caravans unless it is building a needed improvement or Wonder.  Whenever possible, these should be IPRB’d with gold (improvements) or caravans (wonders) so that production shields will go primarily toward more caravans. This is because the cost of rushing an improvement (2g/s) is less than rushing units (~2.5g/s), and unit (i.e., caravan) shields are cheaper than purchasing wonder shields (4g/s).  If more foreign-demand trade goods become unblocked, those goods should be produced immediately and delivered because the bonus will exceed the cost of building the caravan, plus we get the beakers.  Otherwise, Doughnutia should build food caravans and contribute them to wonders.  Doughnutia should not support any additional units as we now get an even 10s when at max trade.  Cutting this down below 10 will result in significant shield losses and much higher costs when IPRBing.<br />
<br />
The Science ministry understands and supports spending on key improvements in other cities to fuel celebration growth.  This growth is crucial to our overall scientific growth as well.  However, once the current round of celebration spending ends (within the next few turns), the ministry believes available production (within reason) should be defaulted to caravans unless a specific need is being addressed. Obviously other items (settlers, dips, ships, defenders) will be necessary, but in general we must build more caravans.  After completing the current improvements in progress, we should change production in several cities to caravans.  The first priority is that 8 camels should be quickly sent to Doughnutia to complete Newton’s College.  The next should be delivered to Doughnutia for trade routes.  As we have seen, these internal trade routes are worth an additional 2-3 arrows each (and more as the cities grow)– trade routes are as valuable as many improvements and do not require maintenance.  We should get trade routes established in as many cities (particularly the “favored cities”) as possible.<br />
 <br />
A couple cities with food surplus should build settlers soon.  We need to develop around our cities – particularly in the west, around Dou, LC and PB– and Bridge Building is coming soon, increasing the workload for our settlers.  The two settlers near Dou should continue to improve that city and should not be diverted to other cities.  They will need to build bridges, and irrigate all flat squares.  Doughnutia’s growth and trade should be the highest priority.  The BS settler should go to LC to prepare it for celebration growth next cycle.<br />
<br />
We should not build any more aquaducts for celebration growth during this round.  Without banks or at least trade routes we will have a hard time maintaining happy cities much larger than size 8, so aquaducts are not worth the expense until the next round of celebrations<br />
<br />
When the celebrations end, the Science Ministry believes science should be kept as high as is manageable leaving enough gold for occasional IPRBs.  Keep in mind that as caravans are delivered, we will be getting additional cash from the delivery bonuses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Extracurricular Activities<br />
The science ministry does not see value in waging war against the Aztecs as was suggested by our Domestic Advisor :viking: .  The wonders they possess are not of much value to us.  Our growth is mostly through celebrations, so the Pyramids are of limited value, while the Oracle is soon to be made obsolete by Theology.  The Aztecs do not pose a military threat.  In fact they tend to be a peaceful nation who could be a valuable partner.  <br />
<br />
Such a war would divert our resources from the necessary development of our trade and infrastructure.  If we focus efforts on maximizing our science output now, we will gain an even greater technological advantage over the other Civs.  Then we can have even more fun blowing them away later :mischief: :nya:<br />
<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
Here is a high level summary of the Science ministry’s recommendations (Note:  the order is important for a number of these steps!)<br />
<br />

(1) Contact Indians –exchange techs for Iron Working and The Wheel<br />
(2) Arrange workers in Dou to maximize Trade arrows (no Einstiens)<br />
(3) Deliver Dou Beads to Ulundi<br />
(4) Rush all remaining shields for University in Doughnutia. (~230g)<br />
(5) Keep Dye caravan within 1 turn of Tenochtitlan, but do not deliver.  Do not deliver VM Copper caravan either.<br />
(6) Calculate remaining beaker requirements.  <br />

 (5) Deliver VM Copper Caravan to Dou<br />
 (6) Don’t  forget:  Reposition workers in VM and Ipec!!!!<br />
 (7) Deliver Dye to Tenochtitlan<br />

<br />
I wasn't aware of this max payment limit. 2/3 of tech cost?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Jun 03, 2003, 02:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:crazyeye: I sure hope this new Science Advisor can maintain the high level of planning and research that has been established by his predecessor :lol:  Great work, Tim.  I think you have the job for life :D</div></div><hr />

I wasn't aware of this max payment limit. 2/3 of tech cost? Yes, once your tech costs get above 300b, the caravan payment is capped at 2/3 of the current total cost of the tech you are researching.  The delivery to Tenochtitlan would net us about 600g/b (varying slightly depending on how much trade they're working in the city) were it not for this cap.  <br />
<br />
Before your tech cost reaches 300b, the max is 200 + some small random amount</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 03, 2003, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Ministry of Domestic Affairs (MoDA) enthusiastically approves of the above recommendations from the Science Minstry and recommends that they should be implemented down to the tiniest details, assuming we receive a nice delivery bonus next turn which will enable 0% taxes for a few turns.<br />
<br />
In particular, MoDA agrees with the following:<br />
<br />
(1) Delay researching navigation<br />
(2) Get BB ahead of Med, Med (and then Shakespeare) is not needed until shortly before Dou can grow beyond size 12.<br />
(3) Do not deliver caravans when doing so causes delivery bonus beakers to be wasted.<br />
(4) Rush buy Dou's university in its entireity ASAP<br />
(5) Whenever Dou can supply something rush buy caravan there - these yield lots of cash<br />
(6) Complete Isaac Newton's College in Dou ASAP<br />
(7) Try to get trade routes in our cities by delivering caravans to Dou when they are not needed for wonders.<br />
<br />
In addition the MoDA has the following 'wish list' of techs (in arbitrary order):<br />
<br />
(a) Bridge building (it may may of importance that the Indians are researching it but their science is probably too slow to wait for them).<br />
(b) Democracy for a better government.<br />
(c) Theology to build Bach so we can have some troops outside of the cities without problems as a democracy when needed.<br />
(d) Sanitation so Dou can grow past size 20.<br />
(e) Medicine to build Shakespeare in Dou, making Dou's growth past size 20 trivial.</div></div><hr />
