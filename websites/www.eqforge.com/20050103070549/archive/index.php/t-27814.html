<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodgers</div><div class="date">Jul 23, 2002, 06:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Up until now I've been using my parents computer and the one at my work to post on this site and play civ etc so I have never had to think about actually buying one or what all the jargon means. But now I think it is time to put my hand in my pocket and buy one of my own.<br />
<br />
So, would you guys be able to help me choose a computer? <br />
<br />
I want a laptop (havn't got enough room at home to put a full size PC anywhere) that can do the following stuff -<br />
<br />
1. Run all the usual Windows stuff (Word, Excel etc)<br />
<br />
2. Run Civ II and Civ III (and other games)<br />
<br />
3. Give me pretty quick access to the internet (I have fibre-optic phone line at my home already)<br />
<br />
4. Be able to use a scanner and photographic software (Photoshop or something)<br />
<br />
5. Not be really slow and crap<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for a particular brand name or anything posh I just need to know the right &quot;spec&quot; to do all the above at decent speeds (er, hard drive?, RAM?, some sort of mhz or ghz &quot;running speed&quot;?  I think these things are important :confused: ). I dont want the BEST money can buy, just be &quot;adequate&quot; - I'm on a fairly tight budget.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm a bit worried about virus's - are these a real danger and how do I protect my computer  from them?<br />
<br />
I imagine such questions are fairly tedious for you but I cant face going into a shop and have some guy blind me with science and end up buying something crap at a rip-off price. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you can give me :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jul 23, 2002, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Big question, bigger answer. :D<br />
<br />
First of all, when it comes to nicely priced computer systems and first time buyers I would recomend a desktop instead of a laptop.  A laptop gives you the convenience of being able to move your system around and that's about it.  And for that added convenience you're going to shell out a lot of extra money and be befuddled by an array of plug and play devices.  What I mean is that laptops only have room for a CD/DVD drive and a Hard drive and that's about it; everything else (3.5&quot; floppies, networking cards, modems) are all plugged into ports on the computer.  No big deal really, but if you want to use those things it's quite a hassle to string up all those cords and carry around all the extra gear.  Still, if you're looking for that portable convenience a laptop is fine, but if you're just going to keep that system in one spot go desktop (you'll save tons of money).<br />
<br />
Now, as far as processor speed goes you can get a lower end Intel Pentium system or AMD Athlon system (1-1.4 Ghz) for a good price.  A processor like either of those is more than enough to handle office programs, games, and 2D graphic apps.  Now if you want to run 3d graphic apps (e.g. 3D Studio Max, Maya, Art-lantis) you will need a high speed processor (1.8 Ghz or above) with lots of Cache memory.  However, from your opening post I don't think you're in the business of using 3d design apps, so I'd say just stick to processors in the 1-1.4 Ghz range (higher if you want, but it'll just be overkill if you're only going to run Excel).<br />
<br />
When it comes to gaming the processor will be fine, but the killer for gamers is the video card.  Sh!tty video card = horrible gaming.  And, when it comes to video card, NVIDIA is the best.  You can put a very decent video card into a computer for about $150 (like the GeForce 4 MX series).  A cheaper option would be a GeForce 2 which you can get for about $80; and a more expensive option would be the GeForce 4 Ti series which could run you upwards of $400.  I've got a GeForce 4 MX and despite the stereotypes around this card, it's a very good, solid card and works very well with my slightly slower 733 Mhz system.  Also, when it comes to video cards, DEMAND AGP.  The other option are PCI (bad) or integrated (absolute rot).  AGP is an interface for graphics cards designed specifically for graphics cards (as is said in the name; Accelerated Graphics Port)<br />
<br />
As far as RAM goes, there is no such thing as too much.  I'd say 256 MB is plenty for what you want to do with your computer.  But when it comes to gaming RAM equals kicking ass.  512 MB makes for a great gaming system.  That part isn't so confusing as the next part.  There are different types of RAM.  The first is SDRAM.  This is nicely priced (you can get 128 MB for $20) but is a little slower than it's counterparts.  DDR and RDRAM are far more expensive -almost twice the cost- but significantly faster.  However, you'll only notice this difference in speed between these types of RAM if your going to run some serious sh!t like 3D Studio Max.<br />
<br />
Other things to consider:  <br />
<br />
As far as hard drive space is concerned, you'll probably never use more than 20 Gigabytes worth of space for what you want to do.  Hell, I survived on a 10 GB hard drive for a year and half and never used all the space.  That was untill, of course, I got Broadband and started downloading mass software (now I've got an 80 GB hard drive that's full of all sorts of that junk).<br />
<br />
For internet access, you should consider what you'll be doing on the net.  In all honesty, DSL or cable internet is only necessary if you're going to be downloading constantly like me.  If all you're doing is the occasional posting here or trifling research a dialup connection will do you fine.  For that all you'll need is a modem, and when it comes to modems the fastest and just about only model you can get is a 56K v.90 modem.  These are really cheap and even if you're not going to go dial up, you might as well get one for a rainy day when the DSL line is busted all to sh!t.<br />
<br />
If you're looking to get Broadband, get an ethernet card.  It'll come in handy if you want to network computers too, but I use my ethernet card solely for internet connectivity.  See, Broadband modems will either connect to your computer via an ethernet connection or serial port.  I like to use the ethernet card, some people prefer the serial ports.  In any case, an ethernet card won't run you more than $10.<br />
<br />
A CD-RW drive is another consideration.  You can get a good one for $150 bucks (the best name is Plextor).  I live by my CD-RW.  I've burned hundreds of CDs with it.  Music CDs, VCDs, Divx, ISOs, and system backups have all found their way to my CD-R collection.<br />
<br />
<br />
All told, you can get yourself a minimal system for under $1000.  I'd recomend you spend between $1200 and $1600 on a system.  That way you won't be wasting money on a top-o-the-line, but will still have a nice system that will last you for years.  I bought this one for $1600 at least two years ago and it still kicks ass (I have upgraded it, though).<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, security issues.  Get an antivirus program like Norton AntiVirus or McAfee Antivirus to protect you from those punk ass strains.  To protect yourself from script kiddies, spyware, trojans and the like get a firewall.  You can pay for one like Norton Personal Firewall, but you can get a free one on the net like ZoneAlarm, BlackIce Defender, or Tiny Personal Firewall.  Most of these also have pay versions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jul 23, 2002, 10:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some things about vendors:<br />
<br />
Some national brands are decent, others suck hairy donky balls.  From personal experience take my advice and do NOT under ANY circumstances buy a Compaq computer.  I don't care if they offer you blow jobs for a year if you buy their system, DON'T BUY COMPAQ.  One out of every three of their computers are returned to the factory for repairs in the first month, and two out of every three of their customers say they will never buy another Compaq system.  Gateway is a little better, but not much.  Dell is pretty much the only National brand I'd consider, but they'd still be my last choice.<br />
<br />
If you really want a good computer go local.  Find some of the computer nerds where you work and find out where they bought their system or if they know a good place in your town that will build you one.  Here in SLC I'm blessed with a great little chain called Totally Awesome Computers (http://www.totallyawesome.com).  I'm sure there are similar stores in your neck of the woods.  I'd recomend you use the prices and invoices and tutorials available on that site as a guide to buying your own system.  I personally guaruntee that the prices and systems available from Totally Awesome Computers are very fair and their systems designs are top notch.<br />
<br />
When you do this you make yourself a great position.  See, if you buy a national brand like Dell or whatever, if you ever have a problem that can't be fixed in ten minutes over the phone, you'll have to ship your whole system back to one of their factories so they can repair it there.  This could take weeks, sometimes it takes even months before you get your system back.  <br />
<br />
But, if you go local you can just take your computer right down to the people you bought it from and they can have it fixed straightaway.  Anytime I've had a problem with my computer that I couldn't fix I just took it back to my boys and they had it done in hours.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another thing to say to all the computer noobs out there:  <br />
<br />
Don't get fooled by thinking that the faster you make the CPU the faster the computer will be.  The speed of the computer is far more compicated than a processor.   The chipset on the motherboard makes a difference, so does the bus architecture, so does the number of pipelines in the chip, RAM makes a HUGE difference.  And when we talk about whole computer speed you also have to think about graphics, sound, the speed of your hard drive, the speed of your removable drives, and even the cooling of the system.  Buying a 2.4 Ghz Intel Pentium 4 processor won't mean a damn thing if the Motherboard can't send information fast enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rodgers</div><div class="date">Jul 23, 2002, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats a pretty bloody comrehensive answer - thanks a lot. A few questions arise - <br />
<br />
1. CD-RW - is this only of use to me if I am downloading music off the net? Could I use it to copy my friends DVDs/CDs direct?<br />
<br />
2. Internet - seems like I cant go wrong here if I already have a fibre optic cable and the only modem available is the best. What's the difference between a dial-up connection and DSL/cable connection? Will this affect the kind of computer I can buy or ISP I can use?<br />
<br />
3. Scanner - you didn't mention this specifically so I imagine it isn't a problem to use one on just about any computer. I want to use it for editing/adjusting black and white negatives taken with a normal camera and fairly simple manipulation of colour digital pics - take I dont need any kind of top-of-the-range gear for that then?<br />
<br />
4. Music - loads of my stuff is on tape - if I had a CD-RW is there a way to get these old tapes burnt onto a CD or do I need some special adaptor/programme/hardware or something?<br />
<br />
As with those &quot;I want to learn...&quot; threads you're a real goldmine BM :D :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

As with those &quot;I want to learn...&quot; threads you're a real goldmine BM :D :goodjob: <br />
<br />
TEEHEE, A sort of sickness for chronically over-eductated people like myself I guess.  I am Jack's wasted life. :D<br />
<br />
1.  This actually is a pretty complicated question, enough to write a whole new thread on.  Basically, if you want to copy CDs your going to run into copy protection.  There is burning software out there that will allow you to get around this provided you have the right burner (like my favorite, Nero).  In fact, if that's what you want to do, it might be easier to just download the MP3 and then burn it to an audio CD using the appropriate software.  Like I said, this is a pretty complex question, so I think we should wait untill you want to do it before I go in depth about the actual mechanics of it.  <br />
<br />
2.  OK, a dial up connection will use a modem to connect to your ISP using the same phone line you use to talk on.  So while you're on the net, you won't be able to use the phone.  Also, with dial up you won't get any faster than 56 Kb.  Its slow, but cheap($10-$20).  <br />
<br />
When you go to broadband you'll pay a lot more for a sh!tload more speed and convenience.  DSL will use your phone line to connect to your ISP but uses an ultrahigh bandwidth so that you'll be able to use the phone and the net at the same time.  Cable on the other hand uses the TV cable to connect to the internet and doesn't even touch your phone line.  The other option is satelite internet which uses a digital connection to an orbiting satelite to connect you to the net.  All these options will give you blazing speeds...maybe 50 times faster than dialup for $40-$80 a month. <br />
<br />
When it comes to ISP choices almost every ISP can offer you dialup access.  But when it comes to broadband you're stuck with whatever company owns the network in your hood.  Around my place Cable internet is only available from AT&amp;T, DSL from QWest, and Satelite from AOL/Time Warner.<br />
<br />
3.  All scanners I know of will just connect directly to your computer using a serial, USB, or Parellel port (don't worry, you're computer will have 'em) and will come with the basic software you'll need to scan images (although I'd recomend you get something better like Photoshop to edit the images).  One note however, when you buy make sure your scanner can scan transparencies if you want to scan in film negatives.  Some scanners just aren't capable of doing it.<br />
<br />
4.  AH, quite a question.  I've never seen any device that can copy audio directly from a tape to digital format on your computer.  What you'll probably need to do is to get some kind of audio input card for your computer.  The ones I know of use RCA inputs (like the ports you find on the back of a TV or stereo reciever); although, you might be able to use your sound card.  Then hook a tape deck into the audio input, then copy your audio to WAV or MP3 or whatever.  <br />
<br />
Kind of a pain in the ass, so I'd say just get on a peer to peer network like Kazaa and just download the songs, then burn them to CD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padma</div><div class="date">Jul 23, 2002, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As usual, BlueMonday is here with the answers to all your questions, Rodgers. :goodjob:<br />
<br />
One thing I will add.  Copying from tape to CD is even more a pain in the ass than he indicates.  Most CD-burning software (Nero is great, BTW) can copy your songs from computer files (MP3's or whatever) to a CD, and put them on separate tracks.  To copy a tape, though, you have to manually put the breaks in, i.e., copy the tape to MP3s on the PC, but after each song, stop the tape/stop recording, then start again for a new file for the next song.  Otherwise you end up with one huge file with all the songs in it, but no way to search/step between songs.</div></div><hr />

He opens it up and inside this little box is a motherboard with ten Intel Pentium 4 processors lined up in neat little rows.  He told me it was some kind of network data router to sort through the 50 or so variables from the 100+ weather stations strung around the mine.  The cost at that time for that thing was around $30,000.</div></div><hr />
