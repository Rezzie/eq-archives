<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 20, 2003, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The biggest decisions now are IMO the following:<br />
<br />
(1) At the moment Dou does not need to build wonders (we have built all the 'SSC wonders' we have techs for at the moment). This means it can build imporvements or caravans. I recommend caravans and establishing trade routes ASAP using domestic trading. We can send caravans abroad later. Since Dou already has lots of improvements and the relevant wonders there's a lot to be gained from trade routes.<br />
<br />
(2) Should we strengthen out defenses by building several crusaders ? I think we need to, especially in the east where the Greeks are nearby. This also strengthens our chances of getting tribute once we found cities on other foreign continents. This delays Mike a little but our defenses are very weak now. Possible tribute would compensate.<br />
<br />
(3) Improving land. I'm including a map showing the most important roads (R) and irrigation (W) that we need. I'm not including any roads that become possible with bridge building.<br />
<br />
(4) Where to build Mike (and we need to start/finish it ASAP). Neu is probably the best option, it already has MPE and building Mike there means there will be fewer critical cities that need strong defense.<br />
<br />
Hopefully it's obvious that you should only vote for one of the C's if you vote for A1.<br />
<br />
The maps below show the terrain improvements I think are of the highest priority (R=Road, W=Irrigation).<br />

<br />
I'd road a bit more around FW/Igloria in addition to what you have there so they can support more trade eventually.  <br />
<br />
I would road a straight line from the Silk to Naervana for the mutual defense units, then go back and road the GL squares on either side. No need to spend a lot of time roading the forest N of Ipecac...it doesn't really do us any good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 21, 2003, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arrghhh... I now realize I forgot to ask if we should RB (or at least PRB) the trireme in Igloria. I think we should since I think we should found the C5 city ASAP. Feel free to disagree with this.<br />
<br />
I also think we need more geographic knowledge of the area near C2 so after C2 or C3a/b/c get founded the trireme could explore that area.</div></div><hr />
