<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King of Camelot</div><div class="date">Aug 13, 2002, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now this is a simple question(although I can't figure it out;) ) so I expect answers soon.:D Just today for no reason the logon to network box stopped showing up on startup. This is annoying because I must logon to the network to be able to access my dsl. Any ideas on how to get it to come back? It never showed up on restart, so that would be nice too:D .....I'm not pushing though. Also I looked into my network settings and nothing appears to be changed and I was no where near the settings when the logon box stopped showing up. Hope you can help....or see less of me:( ....QUIT PARTYING!:lol:</div></div><hr />

(It's also called Tweak UI 1.33)<br />

For you XP users (this is not for KoC), this might apply to you (the easy MS uninstall method):<br />
Manually Remove TweakUI v1.33 and Earlier<br />

Posted: June 03, 2002<br />
<br />
Before installing the new version of Tweak UI, the PowerToy tool that lets you make changes to the Windows XP default user interface, you must uninstall old versions of Tweak UI.<br />
<br />
To manually remove TweakUI v1.33 (and earlier)<br />
<br />
Click Start, click Search, and search for TWEAKUI.CPL, TWEAKUI.HLP and TWEAKUI.GID. When each of these files has been located, delete it. TWEAKUI.GID may not exist on your system.<br />
Click Start, click Run and type REGEDIT.<br />
If you want to remove the Shortcut Icon customization, navigate to the Registry branches indicated below and modify or delete the values as instructed.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Icons\29<br />
<br />
In the right pane, locate the value named 29. Right-click this value, and then click Delete.<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\WindowMetrics<br />
In the right pane, locate the value called Shell Icon Size. Double-click this entry and set the value to 32.<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<br />
In the right pane, locate the value called Tweak UI. Right-click this value and click Delete.<br />
<br />
Close the Registry Editor.<br />
<br />
Warning: Incorrectly editing the registry may severely damage your system.</div></div><hr />

Its a DHCP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Aug 15, 2002, 03:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm...I've never seen the network settings just up and disappear like a fart in the wind.  Something must have been changed.  Unless you can pinpoint what changed, it's not just going to come back.  What I would do is remove all the network settings and start from scratch.  Uninstall Client for Microsoft, your TCP/IP protocol, maybe even your NIC, then reinstall and restore everything.<br />
<br />
I've reinstalled DHCP connections a half dozen times on my own 98se computer.  So if you need a helpin' hand just let me know.</div></div><hr />
