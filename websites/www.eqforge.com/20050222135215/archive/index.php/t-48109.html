3750bc - Tax was changed to 50:50 and production in RF was changed to warrior.<br />
<br />
3700 - Lunatic Pandora founded on the forest and warrior started. Hut popped to reveal archer. Decide to send one archer SE and the other S.<br />
<br />
3650 - Nothing of note happens.<br />
<br />
3600 - RF builds warrior and starts settler. Warrior finds banana within the city radius. SE archer finds another hut.<br />
<br />
3550 - Due to the overwhelming agreement to pop the last hut, the distance from any cities, and the terrain - the archer pops the hut. Barbarians! :eek: 1 horseman appears, which kills the archer. (Fortunately not our NONE archer).<br />
<br />
The other archer has enough time to reach LP before the injured horseman would.<br />
<br />
3500 - LP build warrior, starts settler. As predicted, horseman heads towards LP.<br />
<br />
3450 - Discover Ceremonial Burial, start Code of Laws.<br />
<br />

<br />
Members of my Government and Loyal Subjects:<br />
<br />
Do we want the archer to protect LP, or is the fortified warrior enough?<br />
Are we happy building 2 settlers, or do you wish to change this?<br />
Do we need more defence/explorers?<br />
Can someone recommend city sites based on what we know of the specials so far? (I think a hill city on the land bridge is a good idea)<br />
<br />
I plan to move again on Monday am GMT.<br />

<br />
Once again if the image does not show :mad: then go here (http://ishaakasha.tripod.com/index.html) to view it. The upload function on this site doesnot seem to be working either which is also annoying.<br />
<br />
Anyway, about the image.<br />
<br />
Red dots indicate the specials<br />
Blue dots indicate huts<br />
Yellow dots indicate some good city sites (maybe a SSC)<br />
<br />
Oh and forget about the white dot, it was used in my calculations. It represents nothing of any relevance here, I just forgot to remove it.<br />
<br />
I would like to see the tax rate adjusted to 60% for science. Its either 1 extra gold or reducing science rate from 11 to 8. I know what I prefer. There is a potentially great SSC site to the west of the capital which I would suggest exploring. I also like the idea of a land bridge city nut I don't want to go through the arguement of mining the hill again! :D <br />
<br />
I will post more later but I am in a hurry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume change to 60% Science, we need it more than gold.<br />
<br />
20,000 people in 2 cities. F5 $2 -0, Sci 3 in 8 turns.  F11 Mfg=4 #1<br />
<br />
RF: serf on Banana pins down the Warrior.  Prefer serf on Buffalo or ocean to cut growth, so Warr can go out for 3 turns then back before needed as police.<br />
<br />
LP: has Warr guard, not used, grows in 15 turns, Settler in 13 will kill the city.  So, send Warr to Mountain or RF? Build a second unit, Warr or Phx?  Either way, we get another unit out somewhere for faster exploration.<br />
<br />
Revised 60% Buffalo: F5 $1 -0, Sci 2 in 11 turns, Sett in 13<br />
Revised 60% Ocean: F5 $2 -0, Sci 3 in 8 turns, Sett in 17?<br />
<br />
Researching Code Laws, just started, known: Alpha Bronze CerBur.<br />
<br />
There are many options.  We could send the LP Warr to the Mountain, freeing the Archer.  Or send the LP Warr to RF, freeing that Western Warr to scout (seems best to me), and pull the archer back to the Mtn...  LP can build a Warr or Phx, but not a Settler.<br />
<br />
We could IPRB a Settler as production approaches 20, we have $15 gold.</div></div><hr />

We could move LP Warrior to mountain, freeing Archer to explore, where?  Perhaps better plan is as GN suggested, LP Warrior to RF, freeing it's Warrior to explore S and W, and move the Archer up to the mountain to defeat the horse, then explore East again.<br />
<br />
The Office of Scientific Research strongly urges a change to 60% science :D, and RF serf to ocean.</div></div><hr />

I too like GN's idea, if we find any more barbhuts, it's better to have a supported warrior killed than our none archer.<br />
Shahadet, I think the main problem with the hill city last turns was that we didn't have time to wait for another settler to mine it before. When we get some more cities going, I'm for the dea too:)<br />
<br />
I'll be leaving tomorrow, so DvR will have to take care of any domestic issues. Shahadets images have been very helpful too.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think the river delta south of RF is going to be of much use as a SSC as there are no specials in the area. It would appear so far that we are on one of those hellish stringy land masses. I would like to see the 4 special area west of RF explored as early as possible because it could be an ideal SSC. I like to get a SSC going fairly early in a game (but not at the expense of a good site, as some might believe of my play style). If the western city site turns out to be poor then I think the city site south of LP has potential. It has a lot of ocean squares which is good for a SSC. The whale is a bonus for early growth and the fish resources will give the city that monarchy food boom. Just a thought right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mad Maestro</div><div class="date">Mar 20, 2003, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you the archers should head for the mountains. Assuming the barbarians continue towards LP and engage them, we'll surely win. Afterwards, they can continue exploring where the first archer left off.<br />
<br />
I don't know anything about the map seeds and layout of resources, but I see potential for a city(ies) near the whales 2 squares from where the barbs are.<br />
<br />
With RF, depending on the warrior and food situation, if the warrior completes before RF grows, would there be time to pop it out and explore a few surrounding squares before the unhappiness kicks in? Rivers will help exploration in this area.<br />
<br />
Btw, I'm not at home so i can't view the save game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Mar 20, 2003, 04:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few general observations:<br />
<br />
We should set science to 60% now. At the same time, we should switch production in RF to the Buffalo. Following this we will have the same science rate (11 turns) but gold/turn will drop from 3 to 1. This amount is so small that at the moment it's rather insignificant. However, RF's shield production will be tripled by this, meaning we'll finish building the settlers in 13 turns instead of 37 (assuming we do not IPRB which would be a good idea if we get $$ from a hut). This is a huge difference and enables us to expand faster, found more cities sooner and therefore increase production/science/$$.<br />
<br />
Once LP is out of danger from the barbarians the archers should head to the vicinity of RF to be ready there if barbarians show up. If barbarians approach LP again from the east the warriors unit there can be fortified on the mountain SSE of LP where it should survive an attack.<br />
<br />
In LP care must be taken when we get close to finishing the settlers so they are not finished before the city grows. Actually building a second warrior now is an option, it can then be sent east to explore, the terrain looks better there (fewer desert and mountain squares).<br />
<br />
The next city site is IMO (46,44). Then some site that uses the whale at (53,43) and some site SW or W of RF, depending on geography.<br />
<br />
Finally, I think we should focus on building lots of cities ASAP and not start worrying about perfecting them until we have 6 to 10 cities. Also I wouldn't worry too much about defending them well (except maybe for the capital) until we start perfecting the cities. Losing an occasional city to barbarians isn't the end of the world, we'll have more cities than if we take extreme measures to prevent this since doing so greatly slows us down in founding cities. Actually losing a city containing no improvements and one warrior at most can be advantageous - when we bribe it back we not only get the cities but also the barbarian units inside, meaning more units than we had before losing the cities.<br />
<br />
PS Phalanxes SUCK !!! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zelig</div><div class="date">Mar 20, 2003, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shahadet, your image isn't working for me even when I go to the site.<br />
<br />
Hmm, much has already been said, anyway:<br />
<br />
I think we should just move our warrior from LP down to the mountain to defend from the barb horse so that our archer can continure exploring.<br />
<br />
<br />
How about establishing a minimum treasury.  I think something like this was used in previous games, maybe someone else could post more information.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Mar 21, 2003, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the last game we had a minimum treasury once our empire was up and go, and I think it was around a few hundred gold. I think getting money is a bigger problem at the moment than saving what we have:) <br />
<br />
When it comes to exploration, maybe we should have a poll on what units we shall explore with. Cheap supported warriors, that are okay to lose to a barb or other civ, or NONE archers that are worse to lose against hostiles, but is more likely to win against them? I think it's better to defend with the archer and explore with warriors, and also explore with any two-move unit we might get fom a hut.:)</div></div><hr />

Can I make a request that when talking about a city site, that some description of where it is (eg SW of the banana) is used. The version I play on doesn't have grid references!<br />

Unfortunately we aren't allowed to bribe cities. We voted only to bribe units.</div></div><hr />

Here is a map:<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads3/democg3_3450bc.jpg <br />
The &quot;C&quot; shows where a city should be founded, &quot;C ?&quot; means a city should be founded there or close to that square. The &quot;C&quot; with arrows means I dont't want a city where the &quot;C&quot; is but somewhere in the direction the arrows point. We need to explore the area W/SW of RF as soon as we can (maybe RF should build an extra warrior ?)<br />

Oops ! I had forgotten about this - sorry. I also tend to react differently to barbarians than the civs. I still think we should expand fast at first even if it means risking losing a city or two. However, we should be more careful with important cities such as the capital and an SSC if we decide to have one.</div></div><hr />

I would like a city NW NW from your eastern city spot. I know it doesn't fall directly in the specials plan, but it will provide a blockade from other units using the land bridge and sneaking though, and also act as a canal. We may be grateful of a canal if the continent is very wide. I'm quite happy to wait and mine the spot first.</div></div><hr />

I agree with building a city there.  I definitely think we should mine the hill square first.<br />
<br />
We can also put a city on the northern grassland square.</div></div><hr />

I decided to re-post this as not everyone seems to be able to view it. <br />
<br />
Red = specials<br />
Yellow = some good city sites<br />
Blue = huts<br />
White = ignore!<br />
<br />
I really want to see the 4 special site west of the capital explored. It could be quite promising what with ocean squares as well, a potential SSC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Mar 21, 2003, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, lets explore W of the capital, for a good low-corruption SSC site.  btw, Our capital is also a good SSC site imho.<br />
<br />
Also let's explore the River S of the Capital.  Perhaps a River Bridge city, S S of RF?  Unfortunately, it is a swamp.  Perhaps the city could first build a Settler, borrowing the Banana or some other good square, then immediately clear its own swamp.  Such a River Bridge is likely to be valuable for vans and defence for thousands of years.  You know, River Bridge Filler ! :lol:</div></div><hr />

The advice you have from my humble self, funxus, and Shahadet is solid.  Other people have good ideas as well, so if it fits with funxus, go with it.<br />
<br />
Another last minute poll right before Jayne moves could be chaos.<br />
<br />
I repeat, LP cannot build a Settler as it now goes without self destructing.  The Whale Forest combination is too much production with too little food.  And when LP does build a Settler, that Settler should probably go straight to a chosen site and found a city pronto.  Change to Warrior, not Phx, then start the Settler.  We just lost a unit, we need more police and more exploration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shahadet</div><div class="date">Mar 23, 2003, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given LP's high production I would like to see it churn out a couple of exploration units (mainly warriors for speed). When LP reaches a comfortable size 2 then we can build settlers. I believe that most agree with exploration of the west because of the potential SSC sites (2). I agree with nemos idea of a river bridge but of course we will have to explore the area first! I would also like to see science boosted as the loss of a couple of gold pales to shaving off 3 turns from science progress. I just thought I would re post my thoughts for your convenience Jayne seeing as the time has long past for a poll.</div></div><hr />

A summary of what needs to be done is vitally important to Presidents, even more so as the game progresses. I would have liked to see polls as it is a good tool to: a) clarify the opinions of the citizens, b) prompt citizens to think about how they'd like the game played, c) let people express their opinion even if they don't have time to make a detailed post or don't feel they need to post as someone else has already put across their point of view.<br />
