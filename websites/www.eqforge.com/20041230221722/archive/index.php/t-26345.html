These people didn't::lol:<br />

&quot;I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.&quot; – Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, 1943<br />

<br />
No, what I mean is that is it &quot;PC&quot;-type computers (which means home, business and supercomputers etc), or all &quot;computing machines&quot;.  Eg. - car electronic ignitions have computers etc.</div></div><hr />

WOW! Only 1 computer?!:D I think philippe got periods and commas mixed up. ie 1.000 = one 1,000 = one thousand.<br />

Just because you Americans neither use correct punctuation with numbers nor a real scientific measurement system, does not mean anyone doing it correctly is wrong! :lol:<br />

Give it time and it will be the American 1,000 and maybe by then the Americans will be using the Metric system! :crazyeye:<br />
<br />
Lots of computers though.</div></div><hr />

We use the Metric system and we use 1,000.</div></div><hr />

:D Speak for yourself. In S'pore and the rest of Asia, we use 1,000,000,000.00. :) :p<br />
<br />
And we've been using the metric system for ages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it ain't gonna, it must be because of some mental barrier. But behold: The Britons did it already, which really is quite amazing. Someone who lives in the UK could give his/her comments on that topic, btw. (Getting a bit off-topic...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people incorrectly (the Finnish standard is for separating decimals is using comma) use the dot for the decimals, I guess that's mostly because they've used calculators at school and at work. Why on earth aren't calculators localised? They've never been.<br />
<br />
KaeptnOvi's system is good, since you can't mistake the 's and ,s for each other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mchorlton</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2002, 12:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most people in the UK would write 1,000,000,000.00<br />
<br />
Although we're meant to have changed to the metric system, many people still use imperial units though.  Road signs are all in miles and yards etc.    i personally prefer the metric system - it's easier to use.  you are taught with metric units in school - which is probably why i prefer it.  i don't have a clue how far 100 yards is, but i would have a pretty good idea of 100meters.  many shops still sell items by the pound but they have to put the price/kg on aswell.  <br />
<br />
Now all we need is our American friends to switch to the sensible metric system and the world will be a slightly better place.<br />
<br />
LONG LIVE THE METRIC SYSTEM!!!</div></div><hr />

[B]LONG LIVE THE METRIC SYSTEM!!!/B]<br />
<br />
Yes indeed. Its logicality and uniformity are good reasons for using it. I guess it's one of the best things the French have ever invented! <br />
<br />
I find it a bit funny that I know how long a yard is and a Briton doesn't ;) Isn't it like 0.91 metres or so...<br />
<br />
While chatting with Americans about temperatures or distances etc. I often use this good metric-imperial converter: http://convert.french-property.co.uk/cgi-bin/convert.pl<br />
<br />
It says one yard is precisely 0.9144 metres.</div></div><hr />

i'll try and remember that!</div></div><hr />
