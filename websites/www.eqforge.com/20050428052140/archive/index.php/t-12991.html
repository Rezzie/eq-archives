But as i now have the view of the full map i cant see how could find the russian and the rest on that continent before you get magnetism. Is this just me missing out on something important or?<br />
<br />
A russian Trireme found me way early in the game, but i cant see anyway it should have been able to pass the ocean.<br />
<br />
The helpfile stats that triremes will be lost at sea, while the later galleon may be lost, is this incorrect?<br />

But if you have the Lighthouse (the thing you forgot the name), it gives a +1 move bonus and allow trireme to cross ocean tile without any harm (but not with the last patch)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChrisShaffer</div><div class="date">Dec 27, 2001, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Triremes have a 33% (or is it 50%???) chance of being lost at sea each turn, so it is certainly possible to cross vast stretches of ocean with a Trireme - but you have to be prepared to sacrifice Triremes to do it.  It took me 6 tries to cross - and the third Trireme foundered in site of land before I could make contact!<br />
<br />
Even after the patch, the Lighthouse gives Triremes an extra movement point and allows safe Sea travel.  Both are useful for increasing the chances of surviving long crossings.</div></div><hr />

If you trade maps with whoever DID get the Lighthouse, chances are they'll settle your continent somewhere.  Then you buy contact with everyone else.  Worked for me.</div></div><hr />
