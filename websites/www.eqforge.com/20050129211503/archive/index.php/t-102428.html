When I try to run a program (that requires a CD) it just doesn't do anything. No spinning of the CD, no error message saying it can't find a CD, nothing. The only thing it can do is open and close.<br />
It doesn't show up in 'My Computer', but in the device manager thingie it does - although it has a ! next to it.<br />
So I check the device status, and it says: Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39)<br />
<br />
Click Troubleshoot to start the troubleshooter for this device.<br />
Since it is a plug and play device, I can't really do anything to reinstall the drivers. I've been through  the add hardware wizard, and it can't detect any newly connected devices.<br />
<br />
After this, I checked the connections inside my computer. Took em all out, stuck em all back in. Didn't change anything.<br />
<br />
I am utterly confused, have no idea what to do, help meh  :p<br />
<br />
Edit: Something else. It wasn't working for about 10 mins last night. Tried to run a program, did nothing (same problem). Left it for 10 mins, and it worked fine. Also something that might help: When opening and closing it this morning, it just stopped half way one of the times. Don't really know if this is related to the problem.<br />
<br />
Edit2: Problem solved :) :) :) Someone else helped. Ignore this thread :) (the solution if yer interested: http://www.siliconguide.com/qa/forum/messages/71.shtml )</div></div><hr />
