<br />
I'm new to this board and to Scenario creation in general but I'm working on building a Babylon 5 scenario. I've already started work on the ships and such but I'm not to good when it comes to the map making or tech trees. If anyone is intrested in helping out, feel free to email me or just post a response. I've found alot of the units needed for the scenario but I've also worked on my own including the Drazi Sun Hawk and I'm working on the Drazi Sky Serpent. There alot of others to go but this is just the start.<br />

If some of them are something  YOU came up with, I'll help, but I don't like stuff that comes from shows, games, the 'Net, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bishop</div><div class="date">May 26, 2001, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The scenarios I mentioned in the second post are events from the Babylon 5 timeline. There were some shows that went into more detail about them but they were never done outright and I thought it would be cool to do a scenario where the player can take the side of one race or the other. Simmilar to the Domnian Scenario in the downloads section here. <br />
This are more of a future idea though, right now I'm more intrested in getting a patform up for the game. <br />

Anyway, have a look to see what you can scavange<br />

<br />
Also, Alcib of A has a heron b-5 mod pack and you might want to have a look at that.<br />
<br />
Xeven, the Earth-Minbari war took place before the first season and the Dilgar War even before that. The Narn-Centauri war took place after the Centauri started collaborating with the Shadows unless Bishop means the original one where the Narn were enslaved for decades. Not much is known except for the Earth-Minbari war.</div></div><hr />

Even though I don't like SCN's based on shows, I'll help. Just give me a list of techs for each race, the prequisite to each tech, and prequisites for the units. OH!

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">May 28, 2001, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">xeven's offer to help is commendable but I suggest that you still do the tree yourself (with his help) because you have to do the entire tree in your head anyway and you need to somehow pass that info to xeven to input. And you will keep changing it (believe me) and you can't get xeven to amend it each time.<br />
<br />
The mainstream way to do tribe specific trees is to use No No techs. If you hae never done a tree before, I do not recommend using this menthod on your first try.<br />
<br />
Instead, just make the prerequisite of the first tech of each tribe's tech branch to be the last tech on a general branch available to all races. Then edit technologies using the cheat menu and give each tribe its starting tech. <br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bishop</div><div class="date">May 28, 2001, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the tip kobayashi, I found the mod pack myself and it was a big help to me. The only thing is that I don't really like the way it was set up with regards to the map and the tech tree. There were some things that got to me, i.e. Centouri could build Thunderbolts and Humans could build Vorchans as well some other inconsistencies.<br />
<br />
What I would really like is if someone who had some experince with tech trees could set it up so that there are race specific techs. i.e. Omega Class Destroyers for Humans, Vorchans and Primus' for the Centauri. I have tried to set it myself but I just get hopelessly confused after about the first 5 techs in.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bishop</div><div class="date">May 28, 2001, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thatnks for the help guys, and I'll give the tech tree a go myself and see what I can get. I just have one more newbie question though, how do you insert a barbarian tribe into the game and then designate units they can use. For instance in this game I thought it would be intresting if raiders(barbarians) would sudenly apear in space using that &quot;carrier&quot; shown in the first season and sporting maybe a squadron or 2 of zepher light fighters. <br />
<br />
I thought something like that would add a new demention to the game... make it a little more unpredictable. If anyone can tell me how to do that it would be a big help.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">May 28, 2001, 10:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not too much into using barbarians myself. When I need barbarians, I usually designate a tribe to be barbarians to control them better because real barbarians are completely random unless they have a city. <br />
<br />
But if you are all fired up to use real barbarians, this is what I know. Start the original game and choose the barbarian setting you want before saving as a scenario the first time. Any barbarian which captures a city will force the city to keep producing itself. You can make barbarians by manually cheating but not through events.<br />
<br />
The rules for which barbarians appear are well set out in Will Keenan's Barbarian Paper which is the authority on all matters barbarian.<br />
 http://sleague.apolyton.net/Guides/sldt_barbtechs.shtml <br />
<br />
Generally it depends on what techs have been discovered. You must keep this in mind when making the tech tree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am looking forward to a good B-5 scenario...I just don't have the time to dedicate at the moment...I've got two major projects cooking well right now...that I'd like to finish...<br />
<br />
Good luck and hope to see it soon!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bishop</div><div class="date">Jun 07, 2001, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just have a quick request for anyone that has a talent for creating civ2 units. I've been workking on the units tree for the B5 senario but I've been having problems with 2 units in perticular. The Hyperion Class Heavy Cruiser and the Warlock Class Heavy Destroyer. If anyone has some extra time on thier hands or maybe just give me a few pointers on how to draw these units in the Civ2 program, it would be greatly apretiated.<br />
<br />
I've tried to draw the both myself but I've only had mixed results at best and nothing I would want to present as a finished work.<br />
<br />
Agian, if anyone is intrested, let me know and I'll help anyway I can in the process.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Jun 07, 2001, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I rarely draw anything except for final adjustments. Usually I get a full size picture or video still and then shrink it down to the correct size.You need something like photoshop to do this optimally.<br />
<br />
Have a look at this page. Its not exactly about units but the general idea is the same.<br />

I have a few images I've found on the web that I try to use as models for a freehand drawing but like I mentioned, the results are less than perfect.<br />
<br />
If you or someone else thats intrested in the project wants, I can email the images of the aforementioned units.<br />
