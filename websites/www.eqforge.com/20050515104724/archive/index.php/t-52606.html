<br />
If you haven't been paying attention, the situation with the despot is out of control.  We have one person playing said position who apparently has the support of just one other person.<br />
<br />
Why is this important?  The emperor controls the land, and we need to determine who the emperor is that does control the land.  An standard method needs to be in place for chosing a new despot (assuming he left no heirs).<br />
<br />
Well, how do we want to go about this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">proposal:<br />
1) situation: no troops fight for the dictator yet (units! not characters!)<br />
direct character fight. with multiple characters.<br />
this would be handled like a brawl in the tournament rules except that groups would fight against each other.<br />
lets say the despot is only backed officially by 1 citizen and the revolutionary is backed by 3, he has a much higher chance of winning.<br />
as result of the fight, some of the characters may die or get injured. each character can state whether he/she wants to withdraw before death or not. if no statement was made up to the fight, a fight till death would be assumed for that character.<br />
each group is lead by one character. this character is the last one to act in the fighting unless stated otherwise by the group leader.<br />
the last group standing and not withdrawn wins.<br />
if a group lost and has withdrawn members, they are assumed to be captured by the winning group.<br />
the leader of the winning group is assumed to be the new dictator.<br />
<br />
2) situtation: the dictator has troops<br />
2a) revolution<br />
the revolutionary troops are lead by one character. if they defeat the troops of the dictator the dictator is assumed to be captured or dead (random dice) and the revolution wins. the leading character of the revolution is the new dictator<br />
2b) coup<br />
if roleplay is done and approval of the game manager is given, there may be a coup without troop involvement. the same rules as under 1) apply then.<br />
<br />
3) duel with the dictator<br />
any non-common character may request a duel with the dictator. if the dictator complies to the request, he can choose the weaons and a duel according to the tournament rules is played out between the characters. note that the looser of the duel will die!<br />
the rule will also apply for duels between and non-common persons... common characters are not eligable for duelling!</div></div><hr />

He is after all a Sage and has the virtues we need to follow as a nation. I'm no sure we can trust the others who proclaim their right to rule.</div></div><hr />
