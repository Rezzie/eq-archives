<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">animepornstar</div><div class="date">Oct 03, 2002, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'm buying a new computer and have a problem, the cooing. i have already bought the box (looks like this (http://www.colorcase.se/img/datorlador_img/42_1c.jpg) ), the motherboard (epox ep-8k5a2) ,the cpu (a amd 2000+ agoia) and the memory (xtreme pc3200 256mb) and will buy a hercules 8500le 64mb graphic card and a seagate barracuda 4 80gb hdd. but the cooling... it will problary be a thermalright with an enermax fan. the ax-7 is however really expensive here in sweden so i might buy a cb-7. then i'm thinking of putting on a 80-&gt;120 fan adapter and enermax 12cm fan and blow the air away from the cpu. so my question is, how much is does it differ between blowing toward and away from the cpu?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perfection</div><div class="date">Oct 03, 2002, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres what you do, take a mini-fridge, strip it of racks and shelves, and drill a hole on top.  Than put your CPU in the minifridge and run the wires out the hole,  caulk the hole to keep the cool air in set fridge to &quot;max cool&quot; and your done.  You wont ever have to worry about overheating agian.  :lol::crazyeye:</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fan actually works more efficiently if its &quot;blowing&quot; cold air.  If it is sucking hot air away from the chip, it won't be able to move as much air.  I'd try and set it up to blow towards the chip. :)</div></div><hr />

This reduces the amount of air for cooling.  Catch 22 :D</div></div><hr />
