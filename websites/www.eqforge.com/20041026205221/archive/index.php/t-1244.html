Although these are rough graphics...any comments would be appreciated...<br />
<br />
Also, I expect to include a scenario with this modpack as well. <br />

<br />
I was working so fast that I didn't realize the corners...I'll have to check that...<br />
<br />
The buses actually replace the villages...but making them a unit is a possibility since I've been considering Winnebagos (RVs)for that. It's been difficult keeping in step with the theme, because there seems to be some questions as to which units would be better...everyone I talk seems to give me different feedback...<br />
<br />
I may end up going with more people-units than I wanted...hm...I'll have to think on this...<br />
<br />
Come on folks...help me out...<br />

<br />
Once you select &quot;b&quot; to build a city, then it would stop moving just like any other settler. <br />
<br />
I've thought about replacing the city graphics with a unit in a scenario like a trader or merchant or maybe something as simple as a bus station or airport...then making all the units settlers and caravans...and changing the game into an &quot;economic&quot; one such as transport tycoon...<br />
<br />
just an idea<br />
