<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Mar 23, 2001, 03:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That would be the 'Kobayashi Battle Outcome Simulator' in full. I've been testing it in parallel with my WWII scenario and it seems to predict pretty well.<br />
<br />
Its an Excel spreadsheet I wrote that simulates combat between two units 100 times and shows you the average result and amount of damage sustained. Input items are A/D Factor, Hit Points and Fire Power. Using it has helped me to avoid physically making the units attack each other repeadtedly.<br />
<br />
As a result, I am having a low hit point, high firepower scenario where unexpected outcomes occur more frequently. For example, once in a while a VA Wellington tail gunner will nail the Messerschmitt Bf109 before it destroys the bomber. Or occasionally a Panzer III division attacking mere infantry may get decimated. Another interesting thing that that happens under the high fp/ low hp environment is that the surviving unit always gets damaged (i.e. sustain some attrition)and need to rest after battle.<br />
<br />
I have sent a copy of KobaBOS to JohnV for testing and if he thinks its OK too, we'll make it available for download soon.</div></div><hr />

I have mixed feelings about the advance of calculating devices. Of course its great that we have computers (and Civ2) but when I was at the petrol kiosk (gas station) the other day, the cashier tried to mentally calculate what two items of $31 cost in total and gave up. He ended up using a calculator.<br />
<br />
When I was in school (in the 70's), calculators were expressly forbidden and we used a book of numbers called logarithm tables to do the more complex calculations. Seems the younger generation's brains are getting 'lazy' from not having to calculate anything. Very soon they'll stop teaching multiplication tables at school.</div></div><hr />

I agree with what you are saying here. When I graduated High School (1979), no one used calculators, we did it all on paper or in our heads. In College (1986-90, I was in the army from 1980-86) I was one of the few students who could do calculations without a calculator. I think we are relying just a bit to much on technology, and not enough on Brain power.<br />

<br />
There are six cells which you enter the Attack,Hit Points, Firepower of the attacker and Defence,Hit Points, Firepower of the Defender. These are highlighted in blue (or was it green).<br />
<br />
The results of 100 battles will be shown. This will show how many battles the attacker and defenders won and what was the damage sustained by the survivor. <br />
<br />
Press F9 to recalc to show another 100 battles. After a while you will notice that the Hitpoints and Firepower are quite important in determining accidental outcomes.</div></div><hr />

I have downloaded the zip from the download section and it works fine for me. Lets assume then that it is a version problem. You'll have to help me fix it as I don't have acess to Office 2000.<br />
<br />
Willem, you seem to understand a bit more of what's going on so I'll work with you first. FMK can take a well deserved rest for the time being.<br />
<br />
My guess is that the spelling of one of the functions has changed in the 2000 version and when it sees a function it doesn't recognise, it will assume that it is a label (which hasn't been created of course)<br />
<br />
First I'll assume that the Eeight is a typo when you posted the message. Next, I'll need you to go to any one of the locations that is specified in F13:<br />
<br />
(One!A7+Two!A7+Three!A7+Four!A7+Five!A7+Six!A7+Eight!A7)/80/C7<br />
<br />
i.e. A7 of any other sheet other than Master. You can jump to any sheet by clicking on the tabs at the bottom. See if the A7 cell is also gone nuts and if it is, see where the cell reference leads to and continue to trace the path unitl the original fault.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, this will lead to the two columns titled A dice and Bdice which have a function<br />
<br />
=RANDBETWEEN(0,$B$5) and =RANDBETWEEN(0,$E$5).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 19, 2001, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a very helpful message I received from Richard Arbuckle III:<br />
<br />
*****<br />
I was looking at your Civ II Battle simulator and had the same problem that a few people have posted about, i.e. the majority of cells across the 9 sheets have the #NAME? error.<br />
<br />
After a bit of investigation I found the cause of the error was the RANDBETWEEN function.  Checking the help I found that to use that function you must have installed the Data Analysis add-in, which I hadn't done.<br />
<br />
Once I added the Data Analysis add-in everything works fine.  As I am not a registered member of the site, I haven't bothered to post this there, but thought you may be interested to know.  Since you obviously already have the Data Analysis add-in installed it must be confusing as to why your spreadsheet wasn't working for anyone else.<br />
*****<br />
<br />
To make a long story short, you must choose Tools/Add Ins/Analysis Tool pack. Seems I did this a long time ago and forgot about it. It doesn't require any diskette or anything and the only difference is that your Excel will take slightly longer to launch.<br />
<br />
Many thanks to Richard. I have made a new zip which includes instructions regarding this on the front page and sent it to thunderfall. If you have already downloaded the previous version, you do not need to download the new one as it is exactly the same.<br />

As I mentioned earlier in the thread, there is a more accurate method proposed based on binomial distribution - which I don't fully understand myself. There may also be other factors (like maybe there are different formulas for different cases???) which I did not take into account. Seems to be that KobaBOS is reasonably accurate if the numbers are not too small, but if anyone can point out what is missing or wrong I can try to modify what I have now.<br />

<br />
Ah, koba... I actually have been heavy into that yet. Still running into other issues to deal with...<br />
<br />
One thing that this won't help for is defensive bonuses from terrain.  A lot of the fighting will be taking place on heavy defensive terrain which is sure to skew the results in favor of the defender. I'm moronic when it comes to mathematics, so I don't know how to add the terrain bonuses to the defender's stats.<br />
<br />
If a defender has a 5 for def. and is on a mountain (standerd Mtn. defense) what would I enter for the defenders #.... 8, 9, 10?  Where are you math gurus?<br />

In default, the Def Number of mountains is 6, which you have to divide by 2 = 3.<br />
<br />
Therefore just multiply the defender's Defense factor by 3. 1 becomes 3, 2 becomes 6 and so on.</div></div><hr />

I tested for a bit today. Just a few units, but the simulator worked spot on for me. And that little equation you just posted is exactly what I needed. Thanks.<br />
