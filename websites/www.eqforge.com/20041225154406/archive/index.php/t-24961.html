<br />
If this isn't an ongoing problem I would just attribute it to the OS having a problem with the game. It happens to everyone's systems. Even with the fabled Linux. ;)</div></div><hr />

Given almost no details, my first inclination is to say that you have an unstable version of a video driver and/or Civ3 makes certain incompatible video calls.   Both of these things can cause what you observed.<br />
<br />
General guidance for anyone posting a problem:<br />
<br />
1. State the OS and any updates (e.g., Win2K service pack 2)<br />
<br />
2.  Motherboard (MB) make and revision number.  (e.g., ASUS P5A, rev 3)<br />
<br />
3.  MB BIOS &amp; revision, and if you have flashed the latest BIOS revision.<br />
<br />
4.  Video card maker &amp; (very important) the video driver revision.<br />
<br />
Example usng Win9x:<br />
<br />
 Use Control Panel ---&gt;  System ----&gt; Device Manager to look at it<br />
<br />
Alternatively, use Display Properties ---&gt; Settings ---&gt;  Advanced Properties ----&gt;  Display Adapter<br />
<br />
5.  Is your hard drive free from all errors (use MS's disk check, or a 3rd party's such as Norton's Speedisk).<br />
<br />
6.  Describe what was going on in detail, including any errors that MS reports.<br />
<br />
The above will help give a better starting point to help you :).</div></div><hr />

Very likely a video driver issue  :).  You might want to back up your registry, then download and install the latest video driver.</div></div><hr />

If it keeps happening and doesn't seem to be caused by any single program then this is a probable cause.  If it happens fairly rarely its shouldn't be too much of a problem, just very annoying.</div></div><hr />
