<br />
Obviously electing a Government, but I think we should leave that until just before we start playing.<br />
<br />
Here's my list, please comment and add stuff, and I'll keep this list updates so we can see what needs doing. Then maybe we can split running the polls between us?<br />
<br />
Map size?Vote now!<br />
Civ Name? - needs discussion starting first<br />
Team Colour?Vote now!<br />
Difficulty level? Vote now!<br />
Delayed start?Vote now!<br />
City number limit?Vote now!<br />
Choose opponents?Vote now!<br />
Flat world?Vote now!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talar</div><div class="date">Feb 16, 2003, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think things like delayed start and city cap should be polled individually since they are means to achieve the same goal. Maybe it would be better to poll for a general idea of how we want to make the game more difficult and then leave it up to a few people to work out the specific details according to that (representative democracy ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Feb 16, 2003, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We can poll stuff together eg:<br />
<br />
Delay start and city cap<br />
Don't delay start or city cap<br />
City cap but don't delay start<br />
Delay start but don't city cap<br />
(single choice poll)<br />
<br />
Or:<br />
<br />
Delay Start<br />
Don't delay start<br />
Cap cities<br />
Don't cap cities<br />
(multipoll)</div></div><hr />

What civ we should be is missing from that list. Also, I would be willing to run some polls after I get back from vacation. (1 week, see vacation thread)</div></div><hr />

Rehoming? <br />
<br />
This would be rehoming caravans/freight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Feb 17, 2003, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I could only suggest a giant multipoll with all the restriction proposed, and only using those that recieve more than 50% of the total votes.<br />
<br />
For example, the options 'cap cities' and 'no rehoming' are in the poll.  The total number of votes in this multi poll is 20.  'Cap cities' recieves 12 votes; 'no rehoming' recieves.  All option that got 10+ votes, including the city cap, would be used.  All those with less, like 'no rehoming' would not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Feb 17, 2003, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Octavian has a good idea. All yes/no options go in one poll with clear instructions to only vote if you want it. <br />
<br />
Other polls such as Civ name, colour, map size, difficulty level and barbs would be polled seperately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Feb 17, 2003, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it worth separating bribing cities from bribing units?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Feb 17, 2003, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Leowind has a point.  A game without an amry of NONE would also add an intersting challenge.  I would have them as two different options.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Feb 19, 2003, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like rehoming Vans, and would also like to suggest a Medium Map, Islands, rather than a brutal single continent.<br />
<br />
The city cap is perhaps the most relevant distortion, in that it would lead to a more manageable game.  But, need we be sticklers about it?  When we capture an extra city, just order it to build Settlers until it disappears...<br />
<br />
Regarding delayed start, how about we wander a bit and build some roads, not build a city for polled A) 10 turns B) 20 turns C) 30 turns?<br />
<br />
Do we want something like the Gotm, or different from the Gotm? Like an MP Game (no bribing)?  I think rules like an MP game would be foolish, in that AI is foolish.  It would not be like an MP Game no matter what we did.<br />
<br />
Restarts on would be fun.<br />
Shall we begin with a vote on Create World?  Medium or Large?  All 7 Civs, of course, but someone may prefer to vote fewer Civs.  Restarts on or not?  Varied or Mixed Land Masses?  Age of World?  Why not a poll just like the Customer World Menu...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Feb 20, 2003, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Polling as per Customize World menu is a good idea to begin with, as it may affect how people vote on other matter later on.<br />
<br />
With map size, it was suggested before that we may want to change the map size from the three suggested, maybe have a square map. But maybe once we have decided small/medium/large we can decide whether to tweak the dimensions a little.<br />
<br />
I agree, let's start polling.......... I think anyone who wants to post a poll, go ahead.<br />
<br />
And how about a new Citizen Registry to get an idea of interest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andu Indorin</div><div class="date">Feb 21, 2003, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, if anyone is looking for a real challenging game, one could add Deity +1 to a difficulty level poll, and barbarian wrath to the barbarian activity poll.<br />
<br />
Of course, this might be the road to defeat ... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Feb 21, 2003, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Andu, welcome to the discussion :wavey:<br />
<br />
I'll be the first to profess my ignorance and ask:  What is Deity +1, and what exactly do you mean by barbarian wrath?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheDuckOfFlanders</div><div class="date">Feb 21, 2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course, this might be the road to defeat ... <br />
<br />
Defeat?? Fanatica defeated by an AI??<br />
I have to see it first before believing it.<br />
<br />
But seriously ,i am all for it to make the game as hard as possibe ,so to make it a challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elsaak</div><div class="date">Feb 21, 2003, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honnestly, I would prefer defeat and learn a lot, instead of an easy winnig....<br />

<br />
But I'm French !!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=24685&amp;highlight=deity1)  a link to starlifter's secrets, check for deity +1</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talar</div><div class="date">Feb 22, 2003, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same for me, never played deity +1, but I much rather play a challenging game and take a good beating than play an easy one I win without even making an effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Feb 24, 2003, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's how the voting is going so far:<br />
<br />
Medium size map <br />
Normal land mass<br />
Random land form<br />
Tied normal/random climate<br />
Random temperature<br />
Random age<br />
<br />
White Civilization<br />
Deity +1<br />
Raging hordes<br />
Restart eliminated players<br />
<br />
Bribing units and cities not allowed<br />
Rehoming caravans/freight not allowed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Disagree with any of this? Get voting and posting!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
We still need a poll on customizing the map size slightly. Also, if anyone is interest in special interst groups/parties can they put forward a proposal and post a poll? Thanks :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andu Indorin</div><div class="date">Feb 24, 2003, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty much anyone can set up a deity + game and barbarian wrath game by adding levels in the games.txt file, though I'd be honored to set up such a game.<br />
<br />
For example of how a Deity + game goes, you can see our Deity +1 Classic Succession Game (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=23240&amp;pagenumber=1).  (Things were pretty tight until about 1776.)  For a really amusing (or perhaps sobering) example of Barbarian Wrath, you might want to check out a game I download in the Barbarian Wrath (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6950&amp;perpage=20&amp;display=&amp;highlight=Barbarian%20Wrath&amp;pagenumber=1) thread.</div></div><hr />
