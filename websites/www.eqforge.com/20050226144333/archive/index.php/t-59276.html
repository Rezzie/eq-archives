<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 21, 2003, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two wonders we can build now, Eiffel Tower and Darwin's Voyage. Once we discover Industrialization (which we are going to delay a bit) Women's Suffrage becomes available.<br />
<br />
We can easily build all wonders ahead of the AI if we want to. Eiffel Tower is useless (especially in this game since we must finish with a spotless reputation anyway) so we would only build it 'for fun'. Darwin is useful to prevent the Indians from getting extra techs and it is not expensive. We can build it and, as a consequence, immediately discover Atomic Theory and Fundy and end up researching Industrialization.<br />
<br />
The purpose of this poll is to check which of these wonders to build. It's not about their prioritization; we are economically overwhelmingly powerful and can easily build all of them ahead of the AI.<br />
<br />
So vote for none, 1, 2 or all of these wonders.</div></div><hr />

Women's suffrage isn't a huge deal. By the looks of it, keeping people happy isn't too much of an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jul 21, 2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With women's suffrage we can keep more units in the field while celebrating, i.e. 2 instead of 1, unless the city has other problems with unhappiness. Since we're going to war, are a democarcy and plan to celebrate soon after the war this wonder might help us a bit. Still, we'd manage without it if we for some reason can't build it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JoeP</div><div class="date">Jul 21, 2003, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the war is done, we can just send all the units into cities or forts, then celebrate like crazy :) If we can keep celebrations while we're at war with the help of woman's suffrage, then we should probably go for it.<br />
<br />
But you are the prez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedBull</div><div class="date">Jul 23, 2003, 11:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DW is a definite thing...why not shove the AIs down into the mud as we run past them in science? :)<br />
<br />
And Women's Suffrage is a need, as far as the Department of Defense is concerned.  Not only is there war with the Zulus and the Greeks, but I see the French being uncooperative as hell next time we talk to them, and unless we brown nose them until our noses are black, don't be surprised if they declare war on us.  So we'll need something to quiet the masses while we dispatch France.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not for all of this war stacked on top of war (it gives me too much to do at once...), but it seems a reality that it's on it's way.</div></div><hr />

In my games I usually avoid these two techs as much as I can.</div></div><hr />
