<br />
1: resistant to change <br />
2: avoiding excess<br />
<br />
This group is primarily concerned with the following items:<br />
 Resist unnecessary rule changes and additions to preserve a minimalist ruleset.<br />
 Retention of the power of the people and resistance against additional specified powers in the government.<br />
 Promotion of a cooperative environment.<br />
To that effect the members of the group are expected to perform watchdog duties for abuses to those items and notify the group in this thread.<br />
<br />
We will discuss and evaluate proposed legislation and do our best to frame viable legislation in a minimalist manner.<br />
<br />
Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, we will work together as a group to show that a cooperative environment without huge overhead is not only possible but preferred. Discourse, tradition and compromise will be our watchwords.<br />

However, as far as I can see regarding polls, we should anounce that there is going to be one and that it is open from x until y. Then we all vote and the result is posted. It is the responsibility of  the citizens to vote so any result should be valid. If only 10 people vote then shame on the those who didnt. Those who did not vote have no right to complain if the result isn't what they wanted.<br />

@eyrei - I agree. The discussion thread in question is here (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=51991).<br />
<br />
@Peri - Absolutely. So long as the pollsters use common sense there's really no need for poll legislation. The only real problem in the poll area that I've seen is when new folk come in with more excitement than restraint and post polls without quite knowing the situation well enough. If this group works to help those folks (and encourage the rest of the players to do the same) I don't see any reason to make rules on how to post a poll.</div></div><hr />

Update: I've added a &quot;Current Issues&quot; section to the first post.<br />
<br />
Query: Several people have stated that the group name isn't that hot. The idea behind &quot;Conservative&quot; wasn't in the modern political sense for far right republicans. It's taken in the meaning of conservation and protection of the status quo. &quot;Minimalists&quot; is a decent name but only hits one of the three basic tenets of the group. Let's take renaming suggestions for a couple days and then we'll poll for a name change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this time there are no rule sets under consideration (as far as I know). I believe that this is the time to prepare for them though. We all realize that there will be rules introduced so I believe we should champion the method of their introduction. As such, I propose the introduction of the first part our Code of Laws, specifically the method of introduction of laws. Let's see if we can come to an agreement here in the group and then we can start a general discussion for the populace.<br />
<br />
Proposed laws:<br />
<br />
A) The Code of Laws exists as the second tier of rules. No set of rules shall exist between this Code of Laws and the Constitution. No lower set of rules shall conflict with this Code of Laws.<br />
<br />
B) Alteration and addition to the Code of Laws shall require a poll of the populace. Said poll must achieve a supermajority for adoption. Specifically, the votes for a change must be double the votes opposed to change, with abstentions excepted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 06:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In support of our third directive (promotion of a cooperative environment) I would like to encourage all group members to contribute and support the Polling Standards Commission (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=52260).

I would also encourage our group members to help keep that group headed to voluntary adoption and support rather than the introduction of rules.</div></div><hr />

Well, regardless of the fact that the name is not supposed to realte to the poitical ideology, they clearly share common roots.  Conservatism, including the ideas that stem from removing 'unnessisary' laws and the movement towards less infringement by the 'meddlesome' governement is one of the most regressive and damaging political/social phenomenons.  It is conservatives that constantly oppose movements towrds social justice and equality ESPECIALLY the protection of the disadvantaged by those same laws and govenment.  Every law and every change to our laws should be looked at simply from the standpoint of whether it will be benefical to the people of fanatica.  Beurocracy is a consideration, but to form a citizen group that takes as a starting point the opposition of new laws is to oppose many of the most innovative and important changes that we have made and will continue to make in our great nation.  <br />
Seeing many of the achetects of those innovations join a citizen group that would seek to stifle invention and change and hold back social progression is very dissapointing indeed.<br />
I will not be joining this group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">May 11, 2003, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Almightyjosh, this is not intended to be a citizen group of conservatives.  If it were, I certainly would not join.  We are not opposed to new laws, we just want to restrict the ruleset a bit.  I wanted to get the name changed, but this group voted overwhelmingly against a name change.  We certainly do not want to stifle invention and change.  The entire purpose of this citizen group, as far as I can tell, is to make sure that we do not end up with a huge, complicated ruleset with unnecessary laws.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 11, 2003, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quite right, bootstoots. We are not against any laws, we are against unnecessary ones. For example, we fully support the Polling Standards Commission (many of our members are also members of the Commission). That group is adressing a potential problem without creating new laws.<br />
<br />
Another example would be something like the debate system. It is being discussed now and will be revamped. We support this system of cooperative change, we just don't want a load of strict laws restrictively defining it.<br />
<br />
If it works without laws then we don't want laws written. If something comes up where a real need for laws is apparent we would not oppose them, we just believe that the effort put into making laws is better served by fomenting a cooperative environment.<br />
<br />
It's working very well so far. :)</div></div><hr />

I initially had reservations about membership here as well, as I would never set foot under the &quot;little tent&quot; of RL conservatism.<br />
<br />
However, we are taking a different approach to this DemoGame.  We are pursuing a ruleset that allows for respectful debate and discussion, rather than adopting laws that would punish our leaders for making one wrong move.  So far this game(and granted, it's still early), there has been no hint of a PI and citizens groups are thriving.  This was the exact opposite in DG2.<br />
<br />
That said, I respectfully request that you consider membership in this organization.  Unlike the RLs, we welcome the dissenting viewpoint as it will ensure that we are making the proper decisions for everyone regarding law.</div></div><hr />

Almightyjosh, this is not intended to be a citizen group of conservatives.  If it were, I certainly would not join.  We are not opposed to new laws, we just want to restrict the ruleset a bit.  I wanted to get the name changed, but this group voted overwhelmingly against a name change.  We certainly do not want to stifle invention and change.  The entire purpose of this citizen group, as far as I can tell, is to make sure that we do not end up with a huge, complicated ruleset with unnecessary laws. <br />
<br />
I agree with the idea of your post BT. Instead of the idea of restricting the ruleset, how about promoting the better management of the ruleset for everyone one in the game. The way we're doing that by promoting discussion and debate is what this group is about:D</div></div><hr />

I was away when the third game was started, and coming back I can't seem to find our beautifully crafted three-tiered law books from dg2, are they gone?  We spent so long working out that kickass system.  All I can find is a rule summary by Shaitan.<br />
Have conservatives like yourselves destroyed all our wonderfull laws, or am I looking in the wrong place?</div></div><hr />

At the end of that game, Fanatikans were polled on a wide variety of factors for us to implement in DemoGame 3.  Among them was a poll to determine our ruleset.<br />
<br />
As you will see by the links I have provided, this matter ended up at the polls twice(plus a preliminary informational poll) before being accepted by the public.  The nation as a whole decided democratically to bring over the basics(Constitution only) and build anew from there.<br />
<br />
I believe that this outcome was a response to the seemingly constant barrage of Public Investigations that many Fanatikans believed to be a distraction.  The belief here in DemoGame 3 is that everything can be worked out through respectful discussion and adherence to our more lenient Constitution.  <br />
