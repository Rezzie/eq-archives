A modpack change some of the features of the normal civ2, but no scenario file are included.</div></div><hr />

There are different versions of the patch for each version of civ. If you have MGE for example, you need to take the files that come with the patch and put them in your civ folder on your harddrive, but you need to remove the files that the patch are replacing. To get to the area where these files are stored on your harddrive, Right click on the civ shortcut icon, then left click on properties. Remove the files that are to be replaced (Rules, Icons, ect.), and put the new ones in their place. Save the orginal files in another folder that you should create for them. You can switch back and forth by simply switching the files back. If you lose the orginals, don't worry about it. Simply unistal civ, and reinstall it, as the files are hardcoded to the CD. <br />

I put the Modpacks file into my civ2 folder whee all the rest of the files are but still no changes. I recently finished a game but no changes were present.Should I try downloading again and in what file format should the Modpack file normally be in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2001, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Fascism modpack file is in a file with the extention .ZIP<br />
<br />
You must first unzip the files for the modpack into your main civ directory in order to convert your regular civ to the modpack (you will need the Winzip program to do this there should be a link in our download section). I say this with quite a bit of confidence because your back up civ files are on your CD anyway.<br />
<br />
Also, please note:<br />
<br />
The Fascism patch you speak of is available in several formats IF it is the one by Steve Strayer. I cannot vouch for other Fascism patches by other authors, but I would like to say they generally use Strayer's patch as a guide from what I've seen.<br />
<br />
As said before, the Fascism patch does not offer a lot of graphics changes except for one or two units, a change to two governments: Fascism (formerly fundamentalism) and Communism (some changes to the rules.txt to be more accurate), and a few different technologies. <br />
<br />
Essentially, you will likely notice no change UNLESS you change your government and PLAY as a Fascist Government...then, you get to experience a large amount of wealth, free units, and Fascism.<br />
<br />
Hope this can be of some help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mike</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2001, 10:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The one way JValdezToo told me how to get this to work seems to be the easiest, if you have MGE. Make a new folder, like your scenario folder an name it modpacks (dont change your scenario folder though lol).Put all the modpacks you download into this folder. When you start a new game save it in the modpack folder of choice, or for you the fascist patch (new folder up modpacks folder). Load game, the one you just saved and the changes are there. Depending one the version you should notice a major difference, the chariot, divebomber, heavy armour etc. are all changed or new. Horse units are 2 attack and 2 defense. Or horse archers if that patch has that unit in it. Just look at the civ info in the game and see if the changes occur, Imperialism replaces Despotism at the start anaother quick way. Hope this helped.</div></div><hr />
