<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 21, 2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There has been a very low participation in the big Coresux build queue polls so I'm attempting to streamline the poll by presenting a 'generic' build queue for all of the Coresux cities. It specifies a priority order of improvements. Needless to say many of these have already been built.<br />
<br />
I'm not including university because we should not build these until just before we restart our science program. In contrast to the other improvements the universities are useless until then and cost $$ to maintain (the libraries are included because they cost nothing to maintain thanks to Adam Smith).<br />
<br />
The reason for (D) is that I think it is useful for some of our cities to be able to start churning out caravans ASAP, we want to stockpile these but it is not necessary to have caravans from every city. This is also useful if for some reason we need to restart science earlier than planned (could happen if an AI civ discovers Industrialization earlier than I'm expecting).<br />
<br />
The reason that options E1 and E2 are there but there's no &quot;don't build DW&quot; is that there's a different wonder poll where at the time of this writing it's looking overwhelmingly likely that the outcome will be to build DW somewhere.</div></div><hr />
