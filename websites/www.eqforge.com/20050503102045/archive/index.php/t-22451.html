<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">May 12, 2002, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been having a lot of game stability problems in this GOTM07.  It crashes roughly once every other turn.  It's not a big problem, and has happened to me in a couple other games.<br />
<br />
The main concern is the RNG.  It definitely is 'random' instead of being the same each time a save game is loaded.  This makes it impossible to recreate the events that happened before the crash.  <br />
<br />
I've been saving several times per turn to try and keep things as consistant as possible, but it still makes a huge difference in outcomes every once in a while.  In one instance, I lost  (Knight withdrew) an elite fight that crashed the game the first time, after loading the game back up I got a GL from the same fight.  On average I've had worse outcomes after the crashes, but this was a big change for the positive.  I could try reloading until I get the same result (or close to it) after every crash, but I doubt I could ever finish the game in time doing this.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how valid my game is because of this.  The GL was just an example of how major some of the swings are.  I had one 'dogpile' set of alliances formed against me after a crash that didn't happen the first time.  This is extremely frustrating.  I hope future GOTM's use the consistantly seeded version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What was the rationale behind turning off the seed-save anyway?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">May 14, 2002, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, not much comment on this thread!<br />
<br />
..SO i'll make a few more.<br />
<br />
Any idea what was causing the crash?  Was it the old unhappiness one, or something else?<br />
<br />
In terms of &quot;validity&quot; of the game, I suggest that you're not intentionally trying to cheat, and hence wouldn't worry about the reloads.  You said that the majority of them have been for the worse, but I guess it all evens out eventually (probability-wise).<br />
<br />
I think that the GL makes up for all the frustration of the game crashing!:lol:</div></div><hr />

I made the savegame before v1.21 has there. Then I loaded and saved it so that it became a v1.21 savegame. So I couldn't change that. I also haven't thought of it when the GOTM was released.<br />
<br />
About your problem Aeson: I can't help you. :( I'm not a computer engineer and have no idea what to do about it.</div></div><hr />

Ahh!  It all makes sense now!<br />
<br />
Its interesting that an up-reved save game DOESN'T have the saved seed though.:confused:</div></div><hr />

But the graphics get wacky all the time. This doesnt affect reloads as i can save and reload at the same point, but i hope it doesnt get worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jove</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2002, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's strange that everyone has different problems. I can generally play for thousands of years without any problems, but then out of the blue everything just freezes. More commonly, the soundtrack gets stuck on a 1/2-second section of the music and plays it over and over and over.....very annoying, but I can at least save and re-boot. But this is one is still only an occasional problem. Each new version has exactly the same type and frequency of troubles.</div></div><hr />
