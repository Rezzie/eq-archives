<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2002, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No... that's a massive barbarian uprising, something you will see a lot when barbarians are set to &quot;raging&quot; as in this month's GOTM. I believe it's mentioned in the manual... :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Try to combat it by sacking barb camps as soon as they appear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2002, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The actual number of barb horsemen spawned in each horde at this &quot;raging level&quot; is 24.<br />
<br />
I believe the lower levels spawn at 8 and then 16 horsemen respectively.<br />
<br />
Did you get two hordes fairly close together, so they came from the same spawn event generation or were these two hordes spawned at time differences greater than about 10 turns?<br />
<br />
It could have looked like two different events if one horde had to wade through a lot more jungles and mountains to get to were you could see them.<br />
<br />
Suppressing the barb villages quickly after they appear is key to keeping them from &quot;OVERHEATING&quot; into a horde, but there is something in the program that I have been calling a bug or at least a really severe programing flaw because currently it seems that every barb village on the planet comes equipped with intercontinental smoke signals or earth orbitting drum sound reflectors that let all the villages all over the planet organize into one single uprising.<br />
<br />
You can stay in close contact with your military advisor each turn, and he will tell you where the nearest barb village is located near one of your towns. The advisor will not tell you exactly where the barb village is but he will get you closer to the village. The only problem with this system is that it only focuses on the village that is mathematically nearer to one of your cities. There could be other barb villages that are greater threats and you will not know about these until you kill the first one.<br />
<br />
You can also buy another copy of the world map for the AI civs that are located 10,000 miles away from your territory and that map will have all the barb villages located on it for you, even though the AI's have never been anywhere near your territory. Haven't quite figured out how it is reasonable for the AI's to get the location of all barbs gifted to them instantly. Maybe Tokugawa and Joan have embassies open with &quot;a barbarian chiefdom&quot; and that lets them buy maps of baarb camp locations for a few strings of beads and some metal buttons. ;) <br />
<br />
I have been complaining about this simultaneous uprising bug for several months because it can really wipe you out in cases where you have a lot of exposed frontier, or when you plan scenario maps that involve all the civs starting on one continent and the &quot;gold rushing&quot; to find and conquer other continents that have lots of barbs.<br />
<br />
These problems are particularly disruptive on large maps with lots of mountains, jungle, and forests because even when you know where the barbs are, it can take you more than 5 turns to wade through the jungle and get to the villages.<br />
<br />
In my GOTM-8, I had to deal with one simultaneous uprising that produced a total of 24x7 = 168 (one hundred and sixty freakin eight) horsemen all in a single turn.<br />
<br />
If one of your neighbors has a neglected village that get old and overheats, I think the coding in the program causes every village on the planet to go mental, ven if the village you are moving to attack has only been around for just a turn or two.<br />
<br />
I had one village that I am certain had just appeared and went to a 24 horde almost on the same turn because I had visibility of the area off and on by virtue of two passing galleys with a small time gap of darkness.<br />
<br />
The only way to deal with these scale of uprisings is to spend all of your gold very quickly and set research high enough to use up all of your excess cash in every turn, so you will break even and leave the barbs with nothing to steal. {editted to clarify on 6/7} In most cases you should then run your units for impassable terrain like mountains, jungle or forests. You have some chance of defending the city successfully if you have lots of military to sacrifice (but that will usually make you a target for your neighbors.) A town on hills with walls and fortified defenders will double the defensive value of your units. SO if you have 3 or 4 veteran pikemen you have about a 50/50 chance of surviving a horde rush of 24 without being sacked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zur</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2002, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was attacked 3 times on the same turn! Total: over 60 barb horsemen! Luckily, they passed after they sacked my cities &amp; treasury. I gave most of my gold away, so minimised losses. This happened around 400BC for me as well.<br />
<br />
I'm also having a fun time doing a &quot;barbarian preservation&quot;, with 5 units surrounding an encampment for elite unit training. The hard part is getting it blocked off before any other civ finishes them off first. Almost there already.<br />
<br />
I expect training to be a very slow process. Probably someone will discover marines &amp; finish them off before I can train a few units. :lol: Maybe I should get 3 ships there as well. :D<br />
<br />
Edit: I think a single spawning generated 20+ horsemen in each of the 3 barb encampments nearby. Consider the &quot;barb preservation&quot; an act of revenge ;)<br />
<br />
and that map will have all the barb villages located on it for you, even though the AI's have never been anywhere near your territory. Haven't quite figured out how it is reasonable for the AI's to get the location of all barbs gifted to them instantly.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes, the location of new barb villages can be spotted directly on the map even if they are in the fog of war, like new cities founded. Not sure why this happens sometimes only with villages near your civ. Buying maps from other civs also reveals barb villages near those civs.<br />
<br />
The only way to deal with these scale of uprisings is to spend all of your gold very quickly and set research to 100%.  <br />
<br />
I did this and lost a granary when my treasury dropped negative. If your treasury is going to reach 0, I recommend setting research to break-even.</div></div><hr />

well my explorer went to the horsemen and of course they try to kill the explorer but my explorer runs away....the barbs follow my<br />
explorer and i lead them to a country named &quot;england&quot;.....<br />
next turn elizabeth has no more gold and almost no military...hehe</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have always assumed that this is a &quot;feature&quot; of the game. I'm not much of an historian, but I believe that barbarian attacks were responsible in part for the fall of Rome, and for the building of the building of the Great Wall.<br />
<br />
The Romans did not have advance warning. I think CivIII players should expect a major uprising during the last years of BC through the early years of AD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The key is to use your cash before the barbs can steal it, just like you do when playing deity so none of the evil AIs will extort the cash from you.</div></div><hr />

U still have barbs during the explorer age??!<br />

I have heard some people say that if we keep extra cash on hand, other civs will be more likely to extort instead of attacking without warning. Not sure if this is true.<br />
<br />
I set the research thingy before u posted that. No worries.</div></div><hr />

fyi, the 22+ horsemen belonged to different hordes. after the first one, i learned a lesson for the next attack. i just withdrew  my units from the city they were targeting and let them sack it. lost more money, but saved my units. not sure if i came out ahead or not.</div></div><hr />

This part i agree with...<br />

<br />
This part needs some qualification - at any level the main factor in determing extortion is power ranking. If you are low on the power totem pole it is a feasible policy, though it is also true that if u have nothing to give you are more susceptible to outright declarations of war as well.<br />
<br />
If you are higher on the power ranking extortion is a less of an issue and it does not always make sense to be perpetually broke.:egypt:</div></div><hr />

Had one huge spawn of 22 units or something. I had 2 spears, an elite and regular. They both died and the last 10 ransacked the city stealing tons of my gold and killing my size 10 city to size 1. <br />
<br />
Other than that, one my northern cities was constantly besieged by barbarians. Every turn they moved 3-4 horsemen and attacked. I didn't lose any spears. Later I saw the English moving archers near there and I got worried. Luckily they were after the camp. And even better 2 of the 4 archers were killed by horsemen.</div></div><hr />

I was attacked by 4, and 1 went to a Russian city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir Ralph</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2002, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also was pretty plagued by barbarians in this game. Since till the early ADs I was busy pruning and vassalizing the AIs, a big part of our continent was still unclaimed, and every darn barbarian uprising on the whole map didn't fail to find its way to my cities. I was countlessly ransacked, my production ruined and my citizens killed. Between about 500BC and 500AD there was no turn where I was not attacked by barbarians. My offensive units were busy on various AI fronts, and the few swordsmen I had to spare for the barbs, were soon killed by the uprising stacks. After 500AD, the continent was pretty much in mine hands, and the attacks stopped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gregski</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2002, 03:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my current game, I had two lots of barbarian horsemen (of the 20 unit magnitude) attacking me at the same time, one from the north, the other from the south. Unfortunately my northern city was quickly ransacked as I only built it a couple of turns before and it only had the standard one spearman unit, but the other city with walls and 4 spearmen survived (had to leave my capital undefended). Anyone else had simultaneous massive barb uprisings like this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Neuro</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2002, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Note: When there is a barbarian uprising, EVERY barb camp on the map uprises.  Also, I think the uprising is hard-coded, since it seems everyone got the same uprising around 250bc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cruise</div><div class="date">Jun 23, 2002, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Imo, the best strategy to fight barbs is to place defense units on mountains. That will slow them down and weaken the hordes and allow your cities to get more protection. Of the 4 hordes i came across only 1 broke my defense line to loot a city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">la fayette</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2002, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice analysis, cracker :goodjob: <br />
I experienced simultaneous attack by 2 hordes of 24 in this game (GOTM 8). I spent most of my gold previously as usual (which remains the best way to make the attack as harmless as possible).<br />
Then I decided to fight them , just for the fun of it.<br />
Both cities were walled with 3 spearmen fortified inside. One city was built on a hill. Curiously the result was the same in both cities: 14 barb horsemen killed and the remaining 10 sacking the city after that (Walls first, then pop, then gold).<br />
Advice: if this happens to you, spend your money and run, unless you have at least walls + 3 pikemen or 5 spearmen inside.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zur</div><div class="date">Jul 05, 2002, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm wondering about the feasibility/repeatability of your tactic, Philippe. If used properly it can be very powerful. There seems unlikely to be many barb huts left after the discovery of explorers, and using movement=2 units to lead barbs is risky. One would need to surround the barb hut with units to prevent other civs from wiping them out. Also, it is hard to lead barbs thro your territory safely to target civ since cities maybe closely spaced.</div></div><hr />
