<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Az</div><div class="date">Apr 14, 2001, 12:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Weimar Republic.  Before the armistice was signed in November 1918, German workers and troops had revolted in protest against continuing the war. This revolution began in Kiel, and spread quickly from city to city.  On November 9, Germany was declared a republic.  Emperor Wilhelm II fled to safety in the Netherlands.  <br />
<br />
In January 1919, the German voters, including women for the first time, elected a national assembly to write a constitution.  The assembly met in Weimar, and the new republic became known as the Weimar Republic.  The constitution established a democratic federal republic in August 1919.  It provided for a parliament of two houses--the Reichstag and the Reichsrat--and a popularly elected president.<br />
<br />
The Weimar Republicwas weak from the start.  Many important Germans remained loyal to the empire.  German army officers claimed that Germany had been defeated by the revolution, not by Allied armies.  The terms of the Treaty of Versailles were harsher than the Germans had expected.  <br />
<br />
In 1922 and 1923, the economy collapsed when inflation ruined the value of German money. By 1923, the republic appeared doomed.  Communists rebelled in some areas.  In Munich, the National Socialist German Workers Party--better known as the Nazi Party--attempted an armed rebellion under its leader, Adolf Hitler.  But despite these events, the republic survived.  <br />
<br />
Gustav Stresemann became chancellor and then foreign minister.  Under his leadership, order was restored.  A new money system was set up to end the inflation.  In 1924, the Allies made it easier for Germany to pay its reparations.  At the Locarno Conference in 1925, Stresemann signed a security pact with France and Belgium.  The pact was also guaranteed by Great Britain and Italy (see LOCARNO CONFERENCE).  <br />
<br />
The republic's prospects looked much brighter by the late 1920's.  But in 1929, a worldwide economic depression began.  Millions of Germans lost their jobs.  The government appeared powerless and political violence increased.  The voters increasingly supported groups that promised a new system of government.  After the 1930 elections, political parties in the Reichstag failed to agree on a program.  Between 1930 and 1933, President Paul von Hindenburg and his chancellors ruled largely by issuing laws without the approval of parliament.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then the third reich was proclaimed ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you wrote about the subject of your SCN I thought it might be a boring one... Now I realize that being the germans would be very interesting....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Apr 14, 2001, 03:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AS Az said: Germany was called the Weimar Republic from 1919 to 1933. What do you mean by eighteen-seventy-five; the year 1875? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">weimar_republic</div><div class="date">Apr 14, 2001, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yes, eighteen-seventy-five and weimar repbulic would be DIFFRENT scenarios. but I have solved this. I remembered that eighteen-seventy-five goes from 1875-1933 and Weimar Republic lasted from Oct 1918 to may? 1933.<br />
<br />
I picked this name cause I am really &quot;un cool&quot; {heay, I play civ II after all http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif} and the Weimar Repbulic has probably one of the worst treated nations ever. also, it had little if not no allies.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2001, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh sorry. I didn't read your posts well enough. 1875? You know what the Netherlands did back then? Our king at the time was Willem III. In the middle 1890'ies, he died and the 9-year old Wilhelmina (she was queen until 1948) became the queen (her mother Emma 'helped' her)<br />
