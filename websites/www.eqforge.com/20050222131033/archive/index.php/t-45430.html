<br />
Please vote for things you want. We'll go with them if more than 50% agree. If you don't want any of them, vote 'No to all' so that your vote will count.<br />
<br />
I'd be grateful if someone would like to do some sort of poll based on the special interests/parties thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Feb 23, 2003, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I plan to say yes to bribing units, no to bribing cities.  Probably no to delay start, but I want to wait to vote on the city limit until I see the Difficulty level.  I'll want to do Deity +1 or a city limit, but I dont' want to try both at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Feb 23, 2003, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Truth be told, I'm tempted to vote for them all...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Feb 23, 2003, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It wasn't clear whether the options were to exclude or include the options in the game, so I reworded it and added spotless rep.<br />
<br />
If the couple people who had already voted want their votes changed because of the rewording, PM me and I will do so.<br />
<br />
Since it looks as if we may be trying Deity +1 and Barbarian Wraith, I only choose the last two options as limitations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">puglover</div><div class="date">Feb 23, 2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No bribing units. It's very historiclly inaccurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Feb 24, 2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not entirely sure what you mean by &quot;delayed start&quot;?  Does that mean we wander around awhile before we establish our first city?  Shouldn't that be in a poll next to accelerated start, since they are the same idea in different formats?  Or did accelerated start already get not chosen in another poll?  I haven't checked all the threads yet--this place was busy over the weekend :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Feb 25, 2003, 05:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I did mean delay our start by x number of years. How exactly we achieve this can be decided later, if people want to go that way. We give the Ai's a head-start rather as opposed to an accelerated start where we take over from an AI after they've built a town or two for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Feb 25, 2003, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I almost think I'd rather do an accelerated start than a delay.  Chance of a wondering rival taking out our settler before we even get started with a delay, and accelerated start means we'll be dealing with the mess the AI left us for the rest of the game, futher adding to the challenge.</div></div><hr />
