recognize it as a valid .SAV file.  I wonder if this is a byproduct of the<br />
latest PC update.  Do people who have not updated from 1.17 in the<br />
PC world have the same problem?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monaco</div><div class="date">May 01, 2002, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">indeed, you need v1.21 to open the .SAV file. Us mac users have to wait.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">May 02, 2002, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry for that. But since the patch involves a lot of important changes we can't allow both versions for the GOTM. And we also can't let people deny installing the new patch because of the GOTM. So indeed, you'll just have to wait. :(<br />
<br />
If it takes too long (what's too long?) we might think of extending the deadline. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Babble-on</div><div class="date">May 02, 2002, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I'm here to complain about the same thing too! :cry: Last month was the first time I actually tried playing a GOTM and I really enjoyed it. It is a damned shame that we cannot play this month...and I bet that we won't see that update for at least another week or two, putting us at a big disadvantage.<br />
<br />
But then again, it is a Deity level game and we will all probably be killed off before we ever reach the Middle Ages!</div></div><hr />

You may want to visit the Civ3 - Macintosh forum to give Brad oliver more pressure.  ;)</div></div><hr />
