<br />
<br />
If you have not already played the GOTM8 game up to about 1000AD (or finished earlier than that) then you should probably NOT READ THIS POST until after you play further into the GOTM* game.<br />

Has anyone else observed that the cultural boundaries of captured cities will sometimes stay inflated beyond the 9 square minimum??<br />
<br />
I could have sworn that before V1.21 whenever I captured a city, the cultural boundaries would instantly collapse back to the 9 square minimum.<br />
<br />
You then had to disband units to rush an initial temple or library if the city had any resistors or was in disorder. This initial rush would sometimes hold out the city borders to 21 tiles but sometimes the city would collapse back to an area of 9 and then pumped back out to an area of 21 when the culture reaccumulated to a significant enough level in 4 turns after the first culture improvement was built.<br />
<br />
I noticed that the culture borders did not collapse right away most of the time in this GOTM when I captured cities in the 5 to 8 size range.<br />
<br />
As an example, when I captured London I knew the city contained the pyramids plus at least Libby's palace for culture. The pyramids had been built in 30BC and captured the city somewhere around 350AD. The city had a corona that was out to at least 3 tiles width. The palace jumped off to Libby's next largest city and the pyramids stayed but no longer generated any musical notes in the screen. All this was as expected. The wierd part was that the cuture corona for London stayed pumped out to the full 3 tile width except in the areas where the culture boundaries would overlap with Libby's remaining cities.<br />
<br />
As a continuation of the example, I could not rush a library right away to start generating culture in London, because I was too busy using cash to upgrade horsemen to knights and also rushing settlers in every possible city. Captured and destroyed a few more English cities and the culture boundaries eventually left a clearly isolate culture corona around London that was the equivalent of 37 tiles in size. This eventual shrank back to 21 tiles in size but I never really rushed a library in London until much later in the game.<br />
<br />
This event happened multiple times with different cities from three different civs.<br />
<br />
Is this just a fluke or has anyone else seen the effect of non-collapsing culture?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As skaternate posted - was it linked to you cultural sphere?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedTopJay</div><div class="date">Jun 10, 2002, 09:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, very weird.  In 370BC, English culture took back London (pop 6) and in 310BC Nottingham (pop 3).  England only had 6 cities.  York being the largest with pop 2 after I took London and Nottingham.  No civ had wonders yet.  Although, I had started the Heroes Epic sometime in the 400s BC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my game I observed England and Russia play ping-pong over a Russian city over many turns. When Liz took it it collapsed to 9 tiles and when Cath took it back it popped back out to 21 tiles. This happen every time until it stayed with Liz.<br />
<br />
The reason this city was of interest to me was that a rubber resource would be in my cultural zone one turn and back in Russia's the next:confused: <br />
<br />
Something has definitely changed!</div></div><hr />

I read (oh so long ago :)) that cities have a &quot;memory&quot; of how much culture it had for each civ. (Civ3spy shows that info). But, I never seen it happen when I captured it (I never tried to rush a temple while it was in disorder too - never knew you could do that).<br />
Why would you want to deplete your army anyway? (except if it's at the end of a war)</div></div><hr />

.... Why would you want to deplete your army anyway? (except if it's at the end of a war) <br />
<br />
Well its not a matter of depleting the army anyway. I have found that with the current culture rules plus the way the program code charges you 8 gold per shield to rush a full improvement but only 4 gold be shield after the full produiction is not required, that this makes some of the older/obsolete units very valuable.<br />
<br />
A warrior has the same military police value as a Mech Infantry, so I use the up to date military units to conduct the military campaign and the older units to fill the military police roles.<br />
<br />
For the rushing processes, there are two cases that apply.<br />
<br />
First, when the city is in resistance or disorder, you cannot rush with population or cash, but you can disband obsolete units to fill the production bin and complete an improvement. Warriors contribute 2 units. Archers and Spears contribute 5; swords, pikes, cats, and explorers contribute 7, longbows are 10, cavalry is 20 per unit. Getting this first improvement quickly can mean the difference in popping out the cutlture envelop 1 turn earlier, or a 50% gain in defense to repell a counterattack, or an extra unit to quell resistors, or an extra happy face to balance the captured population.<br />
<br />
Never set a city to produce wealth under the current rules (except in cases of science and treaty cash shortages). The wealth setting will waste 3/4ths of your shield production capacity. Producing wealth in a city that has 40 shields of capacity will only produce 10 gold units of wealth (if you have economics) and then if you rush walls in a captured city the walls will cost you 80 gold units if you rush the whole balance. If the wealth used to produce the walls came from converting shields to wealth and then back again, the shield cost of the rushed wall would be 320 shields. If you built a longbowman in your 40 shield city and then had that longbowmen in the assault force, you could disband the longbowman in the captured city and complete the walls instantly for an effective cost of 40 shields. Which option would you choose?<br />
<br />
A second example would be the partial cash rush example where you want to use some cash to rush the walls and gain the defensive bonus as quickly as possible. If you try and rush the total amount of 10 shields you would have to pay 80 gold units. If you wait one turn until a shield is produced in the captured city, then the balance of shields required will only be 9 shields, but the rush cost programming will now use a multiplier of 4 to give you a cost of 36 shields to rush complete the walls. Effectively, the value of that first shield that got contributed to the production bin was 44 gold pieces and that's a great gain in value. If you disbanded a warrior and gained 2 shields in the bin then the cost of rushing the walls would instantly drop from 80 gold units for the total rush down to only 32 gold units for the balance after the warrior. The warrior used in this manner would have a gold value of 48 pieces of gold for an original investment of 10 shields of production, quite a big difference in gold yield compared to switching that 10 shields of production to the wealth setting and only getting between 1 and 3 pieces of gold into the treasury.<br />
