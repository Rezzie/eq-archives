If you don't, then don't vote. If you don't want any at all, then vote 'No to all', that way your vote is counted in the total votes. Any options which get more than 50% of the total votes we use, less than 50% we don't. Agreed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Feb 21, 2003, 11:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure about restart eliminated civs, so I'm not quite ready to vote yet.  I'd be interested in hearing people's opinios about this before I vote.  In my limited experience with this it's more of an annoyance than any real challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elsaak</div><div class="date">Feb 21, 2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that clearly an annoyance ; but tonight, I just want for us the best challenge that we can imagine !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Feb 21, 2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm rather puzzled.  It seems only two people voted for multiple options.  Weren't we trying to make this hard?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Feb 22, 2003, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just voted for restart players. I always have it switched on, but don't often get new civs. I think it depends on whether there is a suitable island free for them to settle on. I thought of bloodlust, but decided we may want to keep our options open if we find we can't eliminate the opponents and want to build a spaceship. I didn't really have an opinion about flat world or accelerated start.</div></div><hr />

I always thought it was a certain year that stopped them from restarting? I usually too play with that option on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talar</div><div class="date">Feb 22, 2003, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm also not sure what to vote yet. If we have a city cap or not and what rules we have for capturing AI cities will have great impact on how I vote here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">Feb 22, 2003, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we should restart eliminated civs (it gives the military more fun *evilgrin*), but that is it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Feb 22, 2003, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went for the bloodlust option, partly hoping that it is combined with a city cap of some sort for more of a challenge</div></div><hr />
