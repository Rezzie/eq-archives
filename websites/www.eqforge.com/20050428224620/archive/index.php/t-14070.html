Lately I've been making a submission form (using Perl, which I am learning as fast as I can) so that you won't have to send me an email, but can simply fill in this form and press &quot;submit&quot;. Easier for you and easier for me. This is how I will see all the results from you then:<br />
<br />
Name: Matrix<br />
Email: matrix@civfanatics.net<br />
Score: 271<br />
Date: 1375 AD<br />
Ending: Conquest Defeat<br />
<br />
The only trouble is what to do with the savegames. (Sidenote: I have thought about it forgetting about the savegame of 1 AD.) The best thing would be to make an extra field where people can select their savegame (still zipped ;)) and when submitting, the savegame will go as an attachment. But I don't know how to do that. This module (http://search.cpan.org/doc/ERYQ/MIME-Lite-2.117/lib/MIME/Lite.pm) might help me, but I have no clue to use it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll ask this in the Programmer Tech Support forum more accurate. But this is more or less my plan. I'll keep you posted.<br />
<br />
But if anyone is able to program in Perl, please check this thread (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=14074)!</div></div><hr />
