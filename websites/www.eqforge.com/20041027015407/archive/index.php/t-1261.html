Its called Imperium Romanum and is about the rise of Rome from a single Italian city to THE ancient superpower.<br />
<br />
Playable are of course the Romans, but also Phoenicians (try to make it better than Hannibal) or the Macedonians (can you conquer Persia in the same short time as Alexander?)<br />

Since Imperium Romanum uses multiple gamefiles (e.g. three different unit files, and several civ-specific rules and events) you have to setup the scenario for your civ before you start it, as explained under &quot;Installation&quot; in the ReadMe file. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thunderfall</div><div class="date">Feb 05, 2001, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A starting strategry I came up for this scenario: <br />
<br />
&lt;u&gt;Capturing Capua&lt;/u&gt;<br />
<br />
First you move 4 Roman legions onto the hill right next to Capua (the hill above the whale). The Independents will attack your legions  for sure, but you will not lose any units because the hill gives your legions defense bonus. Don't attack them in turn 2 because your legions must be damaged, fortify them on the hill instead. They will attack your legions again in turn 2; you still will not lose any unit.  By turn three, all your fortified units on the hill are in good health.  Now is the time to attack!! Capua should only have 1 or 2 units left and you will be able to take Capua in turn 3! Use the same strategy to capture Paestum. <br />
<br />
I play this scenario on emperor level. The year is 348 BC and I have just captured the barbarian city Mediolanum. I have a total of 8 cities. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BeBro</div><div class="date">Feb 06, 2001, 05:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi Thunderfall, the Teutons (Partisans) have:  <br />
Attack 8, Defense 4, Hitpoints 1, Firepower 1 , Movepoints 1 in the beginning<br />
With the third change of events/rules their Hitpoints and Firepower are upgraded to 2/2.<br />
<br />
And your strategy is good &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif&quot; border=0&gt;, also for other cities, except that for some of them are more Legions needed...&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />

I tested it immediately on my Computer, and it worked fine... If anyone else has problems, please mail me, or post them here. I앏l try to make an update in the next days...<br />

If you are &lt;u&gt;really desperate&lt;/u&gt; and if you have lots of units (maybe 8 or 9), you can effectively prevent them from landing in the first place by filling all the coastal squares with units in southern Italy. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />

But its not drawed, its rendered with a 3D graphics software. I took me a lot of time to model the guy and the building, but once this is done, you can render several images pretty fast. Some of the textures (e.g. for the shield) and some corrections or improvements were finally made with a &quot;normal&quot; graphics software...http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />

I am looking for some title.gifs and maybe a few other graphics here and there for when I start some version 2.0s for some of my mods...I am currently preparing some ideas for a couple of scenarios...I can give you more details in a couple of weeks...mostly, I'd like someone who might be willing to help me fix up some current graphics I've already got...it shouldn't be too hard...I just don't have the software or know how to get the most out of what I do have...any help would be appreciated of course...<br />

ok...let me see...did I miss anything? Probably...but I'll let you know later...hehe<br />

<br />
I have a small correction for you!<br />
When you get the 261 BC message you use the German und insted of the English and in the scentence Triremes und quinqueremes<br />
BTW I really love this scenario - it's one of the best I have ever tryed.<br />

<br />
First I have to say this is a fantastic scenario.  Keep up the great work.<br />
<br />
However, I did run into a problem.  I have researched Embolon and even built a Naval Base, but somehow I can't build a Triere.  http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/frown.gif  It's simply not in the list of things I can build.  What could I have done wrong?  I am using the English version and playing as the Romans.  It is up to date -- I just downloaded it from your website last night.<br />
<br />
Have anyone else seen the same problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jing</div><div class="date">Mar 02, 2001, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">More problems.  Now I have discovered Cohort Tactics, but I can't build Arsenal.  Something is terribly wrong here.<br />
<br />
BTW, I have MGE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;1-Trieres are obsolete for the Romans, so can only be built by other civs.  The reason for this is that the Romans hadn앖 an own warfleet before the 1st Punic War, so I wanted to limit their naval activities. You have to research the Corvus tech to build Quinqueremes, these are the first Roman warships.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;2-an Arsenal can only be built, if you have built a manufacture before in the city.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;So both things are correct, but perhaps I should explain such things better in the ReadMe file.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry about my ignorance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW, the Fabrica in Rome is not the same as the Manufacture. The Manufacture is the normal civ2 Factory, the Fabrica is the Civ2 Industrial(?) Plant. Fabricas can앖 be built, so only Rome has this advantage.<br />
<br />
You also asked about Oligarchy and Democracy: both are forbidden for the Human player http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

Unfortunately I앐 currently very busy with my normal life, so I앐 not sure if I can update the readme soon. However, if you have other questions, contact me via mail, or here at the forum http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jing</div><div class="date">Mar 05, 2001, 04:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yet more problems.  After running the setup for the Romans at 146 BC, I got a message saying there is an error in the events file.  http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/frown.gif   Anybody seen the same problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BeBro</div><div class="date">Mar 05, 2001, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I tested it, and it runs fine on my machine. <br />
<br />
But I remember that two other players have reported a similar problem. The reason was that a civ (the Greeks) were destroyed before 146BC, and so, after the eventschange every event related to the Greeks caused an error. These two civers suggested to delete events from the eventsfile that are related to a previously destroyed civ, but I think this is not the best solution.<br />
But the really stupid thing is that the same situation did not cause an error in other games, even with the same civ version. I tried to reproduce this error several times, but everything run absolutely correct. So I앐 really unsure how to solve that. has anyone else the same encountered problem?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Mar 05, 2001, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey BeBro,<br />
<br />
Glad to see you can take time for a little, &quot;nomal&quot; life...hehe...I do that sometimes...Anyway, to everyone else, sometimes in detailed complex scenarios with multiple events (and in BeBro's case, setups) you end up a few wierd things happening (events error message) such as if you kill off the Greeks too early. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if the solution is to fix the events or rather to make this note available in the readme.txt file. I would think that there is no way to know every possible combination of playing and that this would have to be something considered for future versions rather than considering it a bug. In making things historically accurate on Civ, it is difficult to stay in character for some players when it's so exciting...I guess that's just the way it goes for really good scenarios. <br />
<br />
We have some really good players at Civfanatics too...so that makes for an even greater challenge for scenario authors...<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
