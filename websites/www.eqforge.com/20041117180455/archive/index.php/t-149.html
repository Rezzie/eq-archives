When I set it to Raging Hoards, late in the game, I get at least 5 NON barb units by bribing them every turn. The sweet thing is they only cost around 150 bucks and they get upgraded to better units when i discover a new tech! Then i disband them so I can build wonders faster.<br />

I think this, next to a NON settler is the best NON to have.  <br />
<br />
Just as a matter of interest...do you (this is for everyone to answer if they want to) always kill barbarian leaders to get the ransom money?  I sometimes buy them off...resulting in a NON settler; the benefit being the obvious.  <br />

What's a &quot;non unit&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A NONE unit is one that isn't supported by any city. If you have never seen any then start a new game and look carefully at the information you have under your first settler icon. Instead of the name of the city that supports it the word &quot;NONE&quot; is written; after all you ave no city to support it.<br />
<br />
The best NONE unit is settler because normally it requires food support.<br />
The best way to have NONE settlers later in the game is to build a city with a a normal settler and then rush-build another one in this same city. As soon as the city size is 1 you'll have to choose between &quot;delay settler production&quot; and &quot;build setllers anyway and disband City&quot;. If you coose the second the settler that will come out will have no support it will be a NONE unit. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
That way you can keep this unit till the end of the game for improving terrain.</div></div><hr />

I've tried this on occasion, but I never get that option.  (Generally, I have tried this to get rid of a city in a really crappy place, but to no avail.)  The city just sits there until it reaches size 2, and then the settler is completed and the city drops to size 1 again.  I presume I am doing something wrong; any ideas on what specifically it might be?  http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/confused.gifhttp://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/confused.gifhttp://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/confused.gif<br />

You have to rush build the settler before you get to size 2.  It costs some gold.  Also, I believe the game will not allow you to disband a city at chieftain level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Apr 12, 2001, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In order to disband a city you have to remember that when you lose a citizen your food in storage stays the same.  If you build a settler when the city is size two it decreases to size one, but the amount of food is still the same, so most likely the city will regain the citizen in the next turn.  So, in order to get around this, you need to deplete the food in the city, dedicate all your workers to industry.<br />
<br />
Also, you can disband cities in cheiftain level.  And sometimes, you will get a non settler when you disband, but if you are near a friendly city, it will be supported by that city. <br />

If it's closer to your city, then it's supported.<br />

What I love are NONE partisans. If barbs actually conquer one of my cities, about 5-10 NONE partisans come out. I can instantly retake that city and relieve 10 shields of 10 other cities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it's a good idea to let the AI conquer one of your crappy cities. Losing some population is worth generating a bunch of NONE partisons. If you let them conquer one of your larger cities (size 30), you can get as many as 20 partisans.</div></div><hr />

When they'd sacked almost my entire empire ( connected by railroad of course ) with several large cities I had resorted to the tactics of withdrawing all my Partisans to my capitol to make a last stand... I think they numbered somewhere about 200 or so... http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/biggrin.gif</div></div><hr />
