Seriously, though, we should make this game as hard as possible.</div></div><hr />

If those two options are chosen, then I would recommend that no other limitations be place upon the game, except perhaps spotless rep and no rehoming freight.</div></div><hr />

For example of how a Deity + game goes, you can see our Deity +1 Classic Succession Game (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=23240&amp;pagenumber=1).  (Things were pretty tight until about 1776.)  For a really amusing (or perhaps sobering) example of Barbarian Wrath, you might want to check out a game I download in the Barbarian Wrath (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=6950&amp;perpage=20&amp;display=&amp;highlight=Barbarian%20Wrath&amp;pagenumber=1) thread.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After reading a bit of Starlifter's description of it, though, I ran across this little nugget:  Deity +1 cannot be read by MPG.  Will we be denying access to the game for bunches of our players if we go this route, or is this info incorrect?  I would vote for Deity +1 except for this.  I'd much rather have Deity (normal) and place restrictions on ourselves otherwise to keep as many players as involved as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Feb 25, 2003, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point Leowind. Although we don't play the game on MPG, we would want to be able to look at it on MPG and Classic  for advisors and others who only have that version. I think if we find we can only play Deity+1 on MPG then we'll have to stick with ordinary Diety.<br />

Edit: I downloaded the Deity+1 game from here (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=23240&amp;pagenumber=1) and it works fine on my version (unpatched Classic budget version).</div></div><hr />

If someone (Duke?) could change my vote for me, I'd appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

Sorry I've taken so long to get back to you all on this; been busy relocating on short notice.<br />

The one thing that I thought might be a quick fix for this problem is to substitute the games.txt and rules.txt from 2.42 and then try to run MGE.  Unfortunately, this returned identical results.  However, the game links provided are to a Deity +1 game; and a Deity +1/Barbarian Wrath game.  So I started another game on Classic 2.42 with Barbarian Wrath only.  I was able to open this resulting *.sav file with the MGE.  So apparently, while Deity + *.savs cannot be opened with MGE, Barbarian Wrath can be.  So, apparently, that can still be an option.</div></div><hr />
