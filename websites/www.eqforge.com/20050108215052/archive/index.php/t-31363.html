Slightly more expensive, and usually slower....but works like a rock.  And tonnes of great reviews on the web.  My old drive was a Yamaha..but I paid $130 USD for it...and it was 8x4x24x.  When there were 10x and 12x drives out.  But I think I made 3 coasters in 2 years.  And they were windows glitches....like full RAM or screensaver, etc...<br />
<br />
However...if you want to go cheaper.....and faster...then LG is the way to go.  (Could be my next drive as I have NO MONEY!  (See Hard Drive Poll. ;))</div></div><hr />

I own one and it's perfect, never screwed up one CD. There are great reviews to be found everywhere on the web on Plextor CD-writers. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Sep 04, 2002, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Plextor CDRWs are my weapon of choice, but let's not forget Lite-On.  Lite-on not only has a great hardware, but includes the best CD burning software available:  Nero Burning ROM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Sep 04, 2002, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have Lite-On. Made plenty of coasters, but less so than my other CD burners (probably cause I push my computer to the limit all the time, running X million different apps :)).<br />
<br />
Plextor does sound like the best brand out there if you read the reviews and listen to the power users.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Sep 04, 2002, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right, Civ1. Plexplexplex all the way, indeeed... They're the rolls royce of the burners. Although I'll never buy those ones. Too expensive ;) But that's not the main reason. The other one is that I'm buying a DVD burner hehe. Much more useful, considering the speed my HD is getting full...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Sep 04, 2002, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use a digital research piece of work. It may not be SUPER great but it makes only about 1 coaster every 30 tries or so for me coupled with some software to help ensure precision.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Sep 04, 2002, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I baby mine I don't make coasters....IT is when I try to burn a CD, move 1+ Gig worth of files around on my harddrives that are on the same IDE controller and play Winamp that I have problems. So, over all Lite-On and Nero is a good combo....I believe that Lite-On makes most CD-ROM/burners anyways, they just get branded by someone else. :)</div></div><hr />
