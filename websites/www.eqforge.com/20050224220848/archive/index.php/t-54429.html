<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is an overview/recommendations of what to do in the following 4 turns assuming no major upsets (barbarian/AI invasions etc.) but playing more than 4 turns should easily be possible. It is based on the poll results and preceding discussion. The poll results may change from the publication of this list until funxus plays but hardly drastically.<br />
<br />
There is one modification as a result of the discussion, I recommend building two caravans in Dou before aqueduct. These will yield lots of cash and science when delivered and probably delay Dou's growth beyond size 8 (because of the aqueduct delay) but only slightly (1 or 2 turns) so this hardly contradicts the poll result.<br />
<br />
Important: No caravans should be delivered in Dou until it has built its three caravans in 520 AD. On the turn caravans are delivered maximize trade and eliminate possible Elvii in the source and destination cities, deliver the caravan(s) and then reset production/Elvii to what it was. This maximizes the delivery bonuses.<br />
<br />
I'm leaving the decision of exactly where to deliver Dou's caravans to our president. Everyone demands dye, Delhi demands hides, Ulundi and Orleans demand beads. Cities far away get us higher delivery bonuses but OTOH $500 10 turns from now may be better than $1000 20 turns from now.<br />
<br />
In addition to the list below we maybe should rush buy defensive units in BP and FJ, either warriors, phalanxes, diplomats or horsemen.<br />
<br />
The entries preceded by an asterisk are some events that happen, for example something that gets built in a city.<br />
<br />
460 AD<br />
Set taxes to 80%, science to 20%.<br />
Rush buy caravans in VM and Dou<br />
Switch to harbor in LP, FW, EF, Ipec, Igloria<br />
Switch to marketplace in Nae, Neu<br />
<br />
480 AD<br />
*VM and Dou build caravans.<br />
*Dou reaches size 6<br />
Rush buy caravans in LC, PB<br />
Start harbor in VM.<br />
Start another caravan in Dou<br />
<br />
500 AD<br />
*Dou may reach size 7<br />
*RF, LC, PB build caravans. These should be delivered in Dou.<br />
Start harbor in PB<br />
Start marketplace in LC and RF.<br />
Rush buy caravan in Dou if possible.<br />
<br />
520 AD<br />
*Dou probably builds caravan, may reach size 8.<br />
Start aqueduct in Dou.<br />
<br />
Continue until we have $400 or more, then set science to 0% and luxuries as high as needed to get all size 3+ cities celebrating.<br />
<br />
PS Apologies if there are any errors in the above plan, it's rather likely :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Dou can reach size 8 without luxuries if you really try.  An elvis gives 3 cups with the market.  since everyone in the city starts out red right now, it takes 4 cups to make a person happy, therefore you will probably need to hire two elvi to get the fourth happy citizen once the city hits 7 citizens, but you still have to maintain a food surplus.  That should be doable, so long as one elvis is the worker off the silk since he's only providing one food.  Not sure, but it looks like that might get us to 8 without interrupting the celebration or raising luxuries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just noticed something.  With tax rate set at 20% science, we are 5 turns away from completing University.  We should probably ensure we get enough science to complete that tech before zeroing out beakers, since that is likely to be desired soon in Dou.  I think going to 30% for 2 turns and 20% for two turns will get us there in 4 total turns if you'd rather do it that way.  Any thoughts?  <br />
<br />
I think a university is higher priority than a harbor for building after the aquaduct.  I don't think a harbor is critical in this WLTCD run since I think we can get to 12 without it.  Does that sound right or did I miss something?<br />
<br />
No time like the present to start lobbying for that science post! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 28, 2003, 04:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, university is probably a higher priority in Dou than harbor so discovering it before zeroing science makes sense. However, I expect more than the above 4 turns to be played before zeroing science and setting luxuries high because of the need to collect cash (above I recommended $400) before starting celebrations. So 20% science may be enough to discover university before WLTP, assuming no luxuries are needed to keep Dou celebrating at 0% luxuries until it reaches size 8.</div></div><hr />
