<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flatlander Fox</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2001, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good stuff!!!  I have played the scenario a few times (As Axis) and am incredibly impressed.  This thing is alot of fun.  My only problem has been the super aggressive AI, who continually turns my allies into quick enemies.  Plus, I sometimes have a hard time seeing things, due to the high content of tile improvements in some areas.  But those are really the only things I have seen that can be improved (not that it isn't great already!!!http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif).<br />
<br />
The tech tree .gif is a good deal, I will be able to figure things out a bit better the next time.<br />
<br />
To anybody who hasn't played this scenario yet, DOWNLOAD IT NOW!!!  Great fun, and you really have to manage your logistics, which to me is the hardest thing to do in any war game.<br />
Thank you Kobayashi for making an excellent scenario.<br />

<br />
This release version is 2r. I have sent quite a few people beta versions of 2 for testing and those are not identical to the version now hosted at civfan. 2r incorporates changes related to feedback from the beta version 2 testers.<br />
<br />
So if you have a version 2 without the 'r' and are playing in a multi-player game, make sure that you download version 2r.</div></div><hr />
