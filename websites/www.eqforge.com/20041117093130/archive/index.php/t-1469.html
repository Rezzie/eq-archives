But in the manual for the Gold edition, it says that in the &quot;rename&quot; box in the tribe editor, you can rename the tribe, the default leader, and redo the list of cities. When I went there, all it had options for was renaming commodities, government, and titles. What gives? In the actual name window on top, it won't let you retype the name over the name that's there (only select from the existing list of tribe names). <br />
<br />
I've heard some people mention &quot;rules.txt&quot; and &quot;cities.txt&quot;, but the manual doesn't tell you how to get into these either. <br />
<br />
Why can't this be straightforward, so that normal people besides programmers can figure it out? Aaarrgghhh....<br />
<br />
(By the way, I know nothing about programming, I'm trying to learn a little, but you'll have to tell me exactly how to get into these text files. Hey, EVERYBODY starts out ignorant, don't they? So I don't feel bad). <br />

-You can make it with the civ2´s editors, you only have to activate the cheatmode and the editor mode and then will open some windows that allow you to make the changes you want.<br />
-you can directly edit opening rules.txt, cities.txt...you open them as a normal text file and when you read some of this you will understand where you have to substitue and write.</div></div><hr />

Beware! Changing the tribes in the rules.txt and cities.txt files can cause some fatal errors! What problems are you having with the Tribe Editor? I've used it for a while now with no problems. I've changed all my tribes many times. <br />

I.e. you can't edit it at all. And as for cities, contrary to what the manual says there is no option for changing these at all--there's not even a field that lists them. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I've found this &quot;city.txt&quot; file in the game directory, the thing is can I edit this for just a scenario (keeping the defaults intact for regular games), or will I have to go back and change everything back again if I wanted to play with the default tribes? <br />
<br />
I hate the way you have to beat around the bush in cheat mode to make scenarios--it's like they're trying to discourage you from being creative with the game, when it should be encouraged.... I HOPE in CivIII they make the whole scenario thing more user-friendly (like the game itself is)--this is extremely frustrating for me. <br />
<br />
So at any rate, is there a way I can edit city.txt (and rules.txt) for just a scenario I want to create, or will it apply to every CivII game? It's all like some arcana only an elite few can figure out--explain it FOR THE PEOPLE, MicroProse!!! <br />
<br />
(Sorry, but this could have been set up a whole lot better, and I'm P.O.d that my manual lied to me....)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you use the cheat menu and edit king, there is a name to change, the editors will aknowladge this name change.<br />

<br />
You can have another version of the cities.txt in your scenario folder, this one will be the one used by the game when your scenario is played.<br />
Change the cities in there.<br />

This is something we all hope for (as well as severly expanded abilities whit those editors).<br />

As I stated above you can edit all the text file sin the support folder and place them in your scenario folder (if you have MGE as you do) and the game will use the files in the scenarios (the one named after your scenario) folder instead of the original files, when a normal game is played these files will not be used and everything will be as normal.<br />
 <br />

(Sorry, but this could have been set up a whole lot better, and I'm P.O.d that my manual lied to me....)<br />
<br />
So was I at first, but since I allready knew how to edit the stuff manually (this was how you did it in the earlier versions of the game) I figured out how to solve things annyway (the manual still sucks though).</div></div><hr />
