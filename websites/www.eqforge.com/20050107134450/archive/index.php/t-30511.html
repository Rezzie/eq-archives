<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King of Camelot</div><div class="date">Aug 23, 2002, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering what others thought on the subject.  I was thinking about building a computer because it cost less and I though it might be fun.  I have never attempted this before and I don't know that much about computer hardware.  I was just wondering if it is really that hard?  Here are two possible answers: A) Its easy, just get a book and you can do it! or B) Anyone with your IQ couldn't do it! You will just waste your money than waste more by having a pro help!  Those are just possible answers.;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Aug 24, 2002, 12:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's easy! :D The only hard part for me was fitting the memory into the slots! ;)<br />
<br />
Just be sure the systemboard is compatible with most hardware/software. Do some searches, or ask around. I had to get one with an ISA slot since I have an older HP scanner. Also think about how much stuff you're gonna cram into your PC (hardware wise). There's only so many IRQ ports, and you can quickly run out of them. Right now, my sound card and network card are fighting for the IRQ 10 slot. The sound card is clearly winning the battle.. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Aug 24, 2002, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You'd be surprised just how easy it is.  A friend of mine and I built a new one just a few hours ago and it took us less than an hour.  You buy all the parts, put em all together, turn the power on and bam.  I'd recomend you familiarize yourself the BIOS.  For us, the BIOS pretty much configured itself, but sometimes conflicts will arise that you'll need to know your way around a BIOS to solve.  <br />
<br />
Now as for the actual details of building one, I'm going to take the cowards way out and just poinjt you to some good sites for you instead of writing several hundred thousand words on the subject :D.<br />
<br />

http://www.hardwarecentral.com/hardwarecentral/tutorials/109/1/<br />
<br />
Also, talk to the people you're buying your parts from.  You should make sure that everything you buy is compatible.  For instance, you don't want to buy a Motherboard that can't handle your CPU, or buy a power supply that's too powerfull and fries the thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anarchywrksbest</div><div class="date">Aug 24, 2002, 06:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes build a PC! I plan to do it once I get a bit of money scraped together. It can only be better than the akward box i have now with LITTLE chance of an upgrade :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">apiaster</div><div class="date">Aug 24, 2002, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have assembled a few pc's (with some help.) I don't know what prices you have in your region, but I have found out that you do not save any money, rather you lose (slightly.)<br />
It has a few advantages though: <br />
you can build/upgrade bit by bit (useful if you don't have a lot of money at one go.<br />
you know what stuff did get into your pc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">muppet</div><div class="date">Aug 28, 2002, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am really curious if anyone knows how much they actually save or lose by building their own?<br />
<br />
Who do you go to to get the parts to build your own PC?<br />
If it is the store your would have bought the PC from, wouldn't they charge you almost the same if you purchased all the parts from them separately?<br />
<br />
If you go to their suppliers, like a distributor of some kind, wouldn't the distributor charge a consumer more for the parts too?<br />
<br />
It sounds really fun to build your own PC.  I might give it a go, but I wonder if it wouldn't end up costing me more.<br />
<br />
Secondly, what if I'm a failure.  Can I hand over all the parts to the nearest computer store and pay them to assemble it for me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pillager</div><div class="date">Aug 28, 2002, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've done it a few of times, and it's good fun.<br />
<br />
I recommend that you know what you're doing first, though, as otherwise it can be very frustrating.<br />
<br />
When I first did it, I managed to short out the MB, by not realising that there was a screw stuck between it and the case. I did it twice, and both times sent it back to the manufacturer demanding another one. I finally got it to work on the third attempt. IIRC, this was with a DX33, an 40MB HD, and 4MB RAM, which was a fair amount in them days.<br />
<br />
Anyway, do it if you can. If you're not sure, read, read, and read again about it first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padma</div><div class="date">Aug 28, 2002, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pillager (and others) are right: it's not that hard, but be sure you know what you are doing!<br />
<br />
I think when I built mine, I spent slightly more than it would have cost me to buy a pre-assembled system of the same quality.  But, on the plus side, I know what is in my computer, and when I upgrade components, I understand what the differences will be, and can optimize the system for best performance.<br />
<br />
BTW, since I built my PC, I have upgraded every component (including MoBo) at least once; most compnents twice or more.  In that sense, it is cheaper, because I only upgrade the parts that need/want upgrading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stat Kat</div><div class="date">Aug 28, 2002, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with everyone too. I started with a prebuilt PC clone years ago (66mHz IIRC) and just started tinkering with upgrading parts a little at a time, when I had the cash in college. <br />
<br />
In all, I've probably upgraded three times, twice myself and once a shop that did it for me. I'd recommend doing it yourself if you can, but if you can't do some searching for shops that will do it for you. Heck, even some of the big chains will install hardward for you, at a premium price.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lostman</div><div class="date">Aug 28, 2002, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've built quite a few systems and I don't see how you lose money.  How valuable is your time?  I know I don't want to spend 3 hours on the phone with Compaq tech support because some little prog is scewing up my rig.<br />
<br />
That and it's all what you put into it.  Look at the Alienware rigs, they cost a buttload.  I can build a system for less than what they sell them for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well if your buying your stuff from one of those electronics retailers like CompUSA, Circuit City, Radio Shack, or whatever they'll screw you either way.  Either you'll pay a sh!tload for a POS computer from Compaq, or pay reatail prices on all the components which will probably end up costing you even more.  That's why you want to...<br />
<br />
If you go to their suppliers, like a distributor of some kind, wouldn't the distributor charge a consumer more for the parts too?<br />
<br />
...go to the wholesalers.  Find one in your town; you'll know the minute you walk in whether it's a wholesaler or not (retailer = showroom; wholesaler = warehouse).  Now, of course, the wholesaler is going to charge you a little extra then he paid the manufacturers, but because he isn't employing a sales staff or a showroom you'll save a sh!tload of money buying from him.  If you buy all your peices from the wholesaler you be saving money instead of wasting it on ChumpUSA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lostman</div><div class="date">Aug 29, 2002, 12:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just keep in mind that parts can only go in one way.  So before you start trying ot cram that cpu or stick of memory into the slot, make sure you are putting it in the way it was intended. <br />
<br />
And if your going with a socked type cpu, BE CAREFULL when putting on yoru heat sink.  Doesn't take much to ruin a CPU.</div></div><hr />
