How the heck do you edit governments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arius</div><div class="date">Apr 03, 2001, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty new to this myself, but this is what I've gathered so far:<br />
<br />
You can change the names of the governments in rules.txt. Before you get to the list of different tribes, and their rulers and attributes, there is a list of the governments and the default titles for these. In this list you can change the names and titles. As a simple change I changed:<br />
Fundamentalism,  High Priest,   High Priestess<br />
to:<br />
Theocracy,     High Priest,    High Priestess<br />
<br />
I'm also trying to make further changes, and implementing a government called &quot;Imperium&quot; (Imperial Rome).<br />
<br />
Some of the attributes for governments can be altered at the top of rules.txt. These are:<br />
-Unit support for cities under Monarchy (def:3)<br />
-Ditto for Communism (def:3)<br />
-Ditto for Fundamentalism (def:10)<br />
-How much science is lost under Fund.<br />
-Communism equal to what Castle distance (def:0). Distance of 0 equals no corruption.<br />
-Max effective science rate in fundamentalism<br />
<br />
With this you can make some changes to you governments. I don't know if it is possible to make more in-debth changes...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oryx</div><div class="date">Apr 03, 2001, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the cheat menu, there is the force government option where you can select the form of government you wish a tribe to start with. The tribe doesn't even need the prerequisite advance either. <br />
<br />
In the scenario parameters part of the cheat menu, there is a section called special rules. One of the options there is &quot;forbid government switching&quot;, something you may or may not want to use. This option is usually used in historical scenarios of short duraction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oryx</div><div class="date">Apr 04, 2001, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to manage happiness the same way you do it the standard game, wonders, luxuries, city improvements. There is no option for changing the amount of unhappiness caused by troops in the field. There is no option for changing trade bonus by government type. You could always fool around with the terrain entries in the rules file if you want more trade. However, everyone will gain the same amount.<br />

<br />
No, I'm from Scandinavia actually!<br />
<br />
But Arius (founder of &quot;the Arian )Heresy&quot;) was from Alexandria, so... http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
