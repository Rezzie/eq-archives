<br />
Sorry, Matrix, but you lack the information to assure anyone of that, even for reloading.<br />
<br />
You would need to <br />
<br />
a) for a particular game, watch over their shoulder and see they didn't, or<br />
<br />
b) for a particular game, have them save the game after every move, then you or a program analyze all the .sav files to assess the likelihood of reloading, or<br />
<br />
c) have seen them in real life where they repeatedly had chances to cheat in circumstances they believed no one could find out, but didn't cheat.<br />
<br />
I doubt that you have this information for anyone, except perhaps real life neighbors.<br />
<br />
You can certainly trust and believe that top players don't reload, but you lack the information to assure anyone that they don't cheat/reload.<br />
<br />
Or am I missing something?  Is there other information available that can provide information showing that top players don't cheat?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go right ahead and knock yourself out with that Forthoffer. But don't expect the results to change at all. The same people tend to win each game because... they really are the best at Civ3! I doubt that any of the top players are cheating, they just happen to know exactly what they're doing. If you have already finished GOTM9 or are not playing in it (like me) look at some of the discussions in the spoilers thread between several players. It's pretty clear that they know what they're doing, not cheating somehow to increase their score. <br />
<br />
I've documented out my last 5 competition games on my website with lots of pictures and such. If you look at the GOTM8 report, I think it's pretty clear there was no cheating going on, just good strategy and efficient use of force. Why would anyone want to cheat anyway? This is just a friendly competition to compare notes and swap stories; it loses all meaning if not played honestly. <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to start a flame war or insult Forthoffer, but there isn't any rampant cheating going on here. We can't know absolutely 100% for sure, granted, but there has to be trust somewhere in this process. And when others do better than me, I'm confident that it is due to the fact that they played a better game, not because they were in violation of the rules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to add my 2 cents to this interesting thread,<br />
<br />
I don't doubt your ability or the one from any of the top ranked players, but having a (very nice btw) web site with screen shoots doesn't prove that you didn't cheat (i.e. reload) during the game in order to achieve that (impressive) performance in your game. Of course you explain the general strategy you used but it doesn't really prove anything (as far as cheating goes)<br />
<br />
I do agree that some level of trust has to be achieved between all players for this 'contest' to have any value.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to the whole milking issue. I think it would be WAY more interesting to have two rankings : one for players who milk, and one for players who don't milk. Or at least a column that indicates if you milk or not during the game. We would see who milks and what kind of score they achieve.<br />
<br />
I don't have the time to milk. And personnaly, I don't see the point. Is it suppose to be fun to micromanage the game for 200 turns and to make it last all the way to 2050 ? It is obvious that the top 5 players milk for quite some time in order to achieve those scores. It is also obvious that they also use &quot;border line&quot; strategy to achieve them. There has been a few posts on this subject and I won't reintroduce them at length in this topic. An example of one of them: send 1 worker from 100 different city to the same city every turn. It only loses 1 population and gives you the advantage to generate 149 specialist every turn. Losts of point with this.<br />
<br />
One could argue that everyone can use those strategy. I say to them : why should I? it doesn't make the game more fun. And as I said, I don't have that kind of free time on my hands. Sure, I won't be as competitive (in score) as the top players but I still think I'm a decent player as far as gameplay is concerned.<br />
<br />
By the way, this is my first GOTM so I am not in the ranking yet ;)<br />
<br />
Until &quot;play the world&quot; comes out, we have to rely on the gotm feature to compare our performance. And so far, I love it. The idea of playing on the same map as other players and sharing our experience is great. But as far as comparing our civ score, I'm not conviced that this is a reliable way to judge our skills.<br />
<br />
I give more credit to a player that will share his toughest moment in a game and explain how he managed to get out of it. That's clearly shows good strategy.<br />
<br />
Happy civ-ing !</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is already simple to determine by looking at what date they finish.  All 2050 A.D. finishes (or very close to that date) are milked.  Except for some of the lower scores, usually,  that actually did need all that time to win.<br />
<br />

<br />
The worker dog-piling is already banned starting with GOTM 9.  Scout Resource denial has also been banned.  I'm sure that there are other tactics used that some may define as an exploit, but most have been allowed (ROP abuse).  Most of the high scorers get their score by getting to the domination limit very early (1000 A.D. or sooner, depending on map and difficulty level) and milking the rest of the game.  So they were very skillful in getting to the domination limit so quickly.  So milking certainly did not get them all of those points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My radical theory is that if you gave a simple written test to all the players, that you would find all the top players would score well in areas that relate to algorithms, differential equations, matrix algebra, and coefficients. (this doesn't mean all the good players are mathmaticians it just means that the aptitudes and skills are common.)<br />
<br />
There is another whole group of players who are concerned with hairstyles on the leader graphics or the color of toenail polish on Libby's big toe. These players will never do as well in the game even if they are given a prescribed build plan and a copy of the full resource map.<br />
<br />
There are semi-random elements that effect the outcome of the game at almost every encounter between two forces. 100 turns into the game, no two people are playing the same game even if they follow the same strategies because the cumulative outcome of the random events changes everything. In GOTM9, I was crushing the world at a speed unmatched by man or beast and then I lost a sequence of 6 galleys while trying to sink one lone japanese galley that contain the last living member of their society. This random setback was really disruptive and I don't think (at least hopefully) it occurred in any other game. The bad luck was somewhat offset by having two galleys survive sleepovers while hearing &quot;Cap'n thar be whales here&quot;.<br />
<br />
There are a number of very high skill exploits that dominate gameplay when you look at score and early finish statistics and executing these exploits well is what the top players do. Exploit here is just meant to imply an executable sequence of tasks that will give you the human an advantage that can be accumulated into a winning strategy over time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just wrote my maths exam yesterday and I must confess, I really like it and have probably done very well. Main topic were differential equations, and solving those is rather a fun part of math. :eek: ;)<br />
<br />
There may be some truth in your statement, especially if you look at the top players for Civ2, especially Starlifter. He more or less disassembled the whole game into its mathematical components and know exactly what one must do every turn to maximize success. :yeah:<br />
<br />
But for Civ3, there may be the better understanding of underlying basic laws of the game for mathemtical &quot;enabled&quot; people, but the game is still far from being fully understood. A thing that has to do with the changed programming style, even the Firaxis programmers probably don´t know all mathematical backgrounds behind every action.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Jul 16, 2002, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One (slightly) different point:  There are complaints about the &quot;top&quot; players cheating.  What about the bottom players cheating?  I am convinced that not everyone plays &quot;by the rules&quot;, and therefore reloads occasionally (for example).  However, there are two points on this:<br />
<br />
1.)  The rules state &quot;no cheating&quot;.  This probably reduces cheating from &quot;wholesale&quot; to &quot;occasional&quot;.<br />
<br />
2.)  If you actually play enough games where you don't cheat you will find that the key to a good score is strategy.  The odd &quot;poor&quot; result due to a random event will be massively outweighed by the strategies you use.<br />
<br />
Obviously this doesn't apply when you get to the point where you reload every time something &quot;bad&quot; happens.  However, a good strategy will reduce the number of times &quot;bad&quot; events happen anyway.<br />
<br />
If you don't get good scores in the GOTM, and if you're still not convinced that the best players play &quot;fair&quot;, then try this:  Get a new GOTM and cheat.  Cheat like heck until you win (of course, you can't submit it).  When the results are posted, I'm sure you'll still find that the &quot;top&quot; players beat you. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creepster</div><div class="date">Jul 16, 2002, 01:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is my two cents,<br />
<br />
I honestly believe that the top players don't cheat.  In all fairness to them you don't consistently come out on top by cheating.  The higher scores are obtained by a careful strategy and a complete understanding of the game.  (There is a lot to be said for crackers theory above,  I believe that the better players do understand the AI's thinking(formulaes))  This is demonstrated by their constant input in the forums and exploration of new ideas and ways to win.<br />
<br />
Look at CartouchBees win last month.  He won by exploiting the game.  He then shared that exploit and it was agreed to ban it in all future competitions.  In order to win He knew what it took to get a high score and how to beat the other AI's early enough in the game.  Most of the top players have the game won by 10 to 500 AD at the latest on every level including Diety. In some games it is probably won by 1500BC.  The rest of the game is a wrap up phase and determining how you want to win.  I don't consider myself in the top (yet) but for a comparison I have the current GOTM essentially won and it is only about 150AD.  Yes there are still AI's out there I have not met (which is why I have note read the GOTM 9 spoiler yet) but it is a forgone conclusion that I will be able to over power them.  I know this based on experience with the game and how many cities I currently have (about ( I have not counted them) 40 and growing fast).<br />
<br />
There probalbly are people who do cheat out there, but I don't think that the top players do.  They have no reason to do so.  Besides it is a friendly game, and how can you honestly feel right if you win by reloading.  The fun is in the HONEST COMPETITION between all of us. :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Forthoffer</div><div class="date">Jul 16, 2002, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to clarify: I never said the top players were cheating. I was just pointing out that we have no evidence one way or another (not counting hearsay as evidence). I'm sure the top players are very good, and have no need to reload, but I still don't have convincing assurance that they've never reloaded GOTM games.<br />
<br />
Also to clarify: I myself am certainly not a top Civ3 player. I still have great difficulty even winning at Diety level, though the other levels are pretty easy.<br />
<br />
I've been playing GOTMs with reloading, but I don't regard that as cheating because I haven't been submitting them to the GOTM competition. Any game I do submit won't have been reloaded, and I'll have save files around in case anyone wants to check (if anyone would care).</div></div><hr />

But you can learn from your mistakes by reloading back a number of moves when you've realized you've made a strategic mistake such as trying to build the wrong Wonder, or miscalculated your city growth rate so you built the wrong improvement.</div></div><hr />

If I have many hours invested in a game and I miss building the Great Library by 1 turn, I may restart.  Otherwise, I pretty much roll with the punches.  I assume many others play as I do, and, like myself would be willing to notate any reloading.  I submit any game which is reloaded in a manner that is recognizable.<br />

First of all it's hard to prove and second noone can beat the best players with cheating unless using a trainer.<br />
Reloading is bad and if u have to reload it means u did something wrong with your tactics. Even goody huts reloading is pointless because u can benefit from everything huts give you.<br />
I remember playing civ 1,2 when I constantly reload playing the same map over and over again. Learning from mistakes makes you a better player and reloading doesn't.<br />
I find GOTM a great oportunity to compare my score with others &amp; analizing my strategy. Have to say that score hunting isn't my style and I get less satisfaction from milking.<br />

Have fun and don't cheat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reloading makes helps me learn from my mistakes faster than not reloading. I've learned the most by playing GOTM without reloading, then comparing my progress against the spoiler thread, then revising my strategy and trying again from an appropriate saved game.<br />
<br />
Reloading isn't cheating unless you submit a reloaded game to GOTM or HOF.<br />

As for reloading for goodie huts, how do you benefit when your unit is destroyed, or when you defeat barbarians without getting a promotion?</div></div><hr />

If the rules are not to reload, then reloading and submitting the should not occurr.  After all, what is the point at being the best if you cheated...  You are only fooling yourself.  Also, you are wasting time if constantly reloading.  <br />

The notion of milking is pointless.  Winning by the eariest possible date and having the same difficulty level should be the determining factor for winning this game, imo.</div></div><hr />

Unlike Civ2, where the contents of Goody Huts or the results of fighting may change upon reload, In Civ3 I've never seen them change by reloading the previous turn.  <br />

I did think that the goody huts would change if you restarted the game, but your experience tells me that might not be correct.  <br />

I admit it, I'm not a very good Civ III player- I can compete with the A.I. and win on most occasions, but I'm never going to be at the top of the league.<br />
<br />
I guess it's cos I get to involved with the game- treating the other leaders like humans and rewarding them for their good behaviour and punishing them for their arrogance- I get very emotionaly involved; I just can't deal with the game on a purely mathematical/analytical level. I love history and I love the way the civ series allows you to simulate history. I also love a challenge, The best game of CIv III is one where you come to the brink of defeat and then ruturn to vitory with a gloriously cunning military/diplomatic strategy. The most boring game of Civ III is where you win by such a huge margin that the other civs didn't even stand a chance (or where you have no chance of winning- an archipeligo map where you start alone and by the time you meet any one else, they are two eras ahead of you with huge empires).<br />
<br />
I have to admit- some times I even giv the A.I. favourable tech trades just before a war (or at least trade with their allies) in order to have them present more of a challenge.<br />
<br />
Cheating would just be pointless- the A.I is already handicapped as it is- I'm sure I would be more ruthless with a human player, but that poor A.I. its just mean to cheat it.</div></div><hr />

But other than 'reloading' the game to continue playing it, I did not reload - not even once! And I'm proud of it - damnit I should be! But I will reload it now that I have sent my GOTM (Matrix, hope you received it.) I still don't know how Space Age Victory works so I'll reload the game and play it for that.:)<br />
<br />
PS - I actually played GOTM09 and reloaded. I thought the rule wasn't strict so I did reload. When I read that phrase in the rules page I was quite in shock and hated the world. All that work gone to waste. I abandoned it and planned to play the GOTM 9 again but was advised against it since you should not play it when you already know a lot of what is and will be in the game. So I all-out left Civ3 and waited for GOTM 10. I'm not spoiling my chances this time and I did not. The guilt is not worth it but the added challenge of a tough game will add to the enjoyment of GOTMs.<br />

I thought that the contents of goody huts always stay the same, even if you reload.<br />
<br />
The contents of goody huts are not fixed. They depend on the state of your civilization.<br />
<br />
Some things that can (but not always will) change the outcome  are - the first four even on the same turn:<br />
 - tipping the same several huts but in a different order;<br />
 - building a city nearby;<br />
 - acquiring a tech;<br />
 - getting rid of all your settlers + settlers in production;<br />
 - exploring the territory around the village;<br />
 - any change in your army;<br />
 - acquiring a map;<br />
 - any movement.</div></div><hr />
