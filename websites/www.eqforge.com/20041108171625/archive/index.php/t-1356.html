<br />
Out of the blue too...I've revived some backup files of VOLCANO WORLD and I've changed the story line a bit but that's ok because the beta is only the modpack at this time.<br />
<br />
There is no 'scenario' file per se, but I've included a starter .scn file for users of FW, and MGE.(this starter will not be the actual scenario, it so that you can play it as a modpack). <br />
<br />
Anyway, I've included some screen shots you can click on and the zip file. Enjoy!<br />
<br />

I also have to credit you for arousing my interest again...I was a little put out when I lossed the graphics I made for it before. <br />
<br />
It's starting to come together so I thought I would get some feedback as to what people might want to see...<br />
