You can play.  just use your regular username for yahoo and start playing.<br />
<br />
The reason i am saying this is because i was hoping to start a cfc yahoo pool league type thing.  They way it will go will be everyone will play a best of 3 'frames' earning a point for each frame one.  you can therefore lose honourably yet still come out with a point.  upon which you and partner will come and report the result back to this thread and i shall edit the results table.  i was hoping to have at least 4 before i start, any more than that however would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
err i think thats everything if i forget anything or anyone adds something then ill try and add it to this post.<br />

<br />
after playing remember to post the results back in this thread so i can add them to the results table. including a little potby pot story if you want.<br />

the league however is still open so people can CARRY ON JOINING.</div></div><hr />

I should be able to play anarchywrksbest several times since I have his MSN address, if others have MSN as well then it would make it easier for me to play more games as I may be online whilst playing a game and be unwilling to cycle through several pages of chat  pages to find anything relevant whilst a new MSN window would appear so that I would know instantly that someone wanted to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for the time being however you only need play NRK 3 times, until youve played everyone else upon which we may play each other again.  but well see what happens.<br />

<br />
the dreaded encounter <br />
BCLG100vsCivGeneral<br />
<br />
After explaining to CivGeneral how to hit the ball play commenced.<br />
<br />
1st Frame<br />
Poor start from both players.  CivGeneral however lifted his game to pot the first ball.  BCLG hit right back potting the next 4 stripes to leave himself in a commanding position.  CivGeneral proceeded to pot a couple more balls before leaving an easy shot to BCLG to pot home the next 3 balls and the black in the bottom left hand pocket.<br />
<br />
RESULT 1-0 To BCLG100<br />
<br />
Frame 2<br />
Good Break from BCLG leaving CivGeneral in a difficult postion unable to do anything Civ played a safety shot.  BCLG however pulled off the luckiest shot to dat potting 2 stripe balls one in the bottom left pocket and one in the middle left.  BCLG proceeded to pot the next 3 balls and looked in a commanding position to 7 ball Civ.  Civ then hit right back potting 5 balls pulling off some good long shots and good positional play.  then however the players continued to hit the balls around for a few shots with not much happening.  then Civ accidently potted a stripe letting BCLG move the white into an easy position to pot the remaining stripe and then pot the black.<br />
<br />
RESULT 2-0 to BCLG100<br />
<br />
Frame 3<br />
<br />
Civ gets off to a promising start potting the first 2 balls of a thrilling encounter.  he gest the stripes this time.  BCLG however hits right back potting the next 4.  CIV pots another 3 before BCLG pots another 1. with 2 each left on the table it looks as if this game will go right to the wire.  BCLG puts CIV in a trickey positional shot which CIV magnificently gets out of however the white ends up running lose allowing the final 3 pots relatively easy.  with the black ending up in the top right hand pocket.<br />
<br />
RESULT 3-0 to BCLG<br />
<br />
OVERVIEW<br />
a very good game for CivGeneral who was playing his first three games ever.<br />
<br />
i will create a results table once all of us have played at least 1 game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gainy bo</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2004, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We were having a mini-discussion in the chatroom about how the table/scoring should be.<br />
BCLG wants it:<br />
<br />
Player | Games Played | Wins | Losses | Points<br />
<br />
You would get a point for every frame you won. I don't think that's a good idea...<br />
I propose:<br />
<br />
Player | Games played | Wins | Losses | Frames Won | Frames Lost | Frame Difference | Points<br />
<br />
You would just get a point for every win.<br />
<br />
What does everyone else think?<br />
<br />
Edit: The columns could be rearranged, i'm not really bothered. I'm just trying to emulate how it's done in Football...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frame 1<br />
tough opening start Dell19 potting the first ball. BCLG hits right back.  BClg stripes Dell solids.  Dell takes a commanding lead 5-2.  BCLG is playing some lucky poor shots just blocking dell off by accident. 6-4. dell is onto the black first.  dell takes the first frame after BCLG pots the white potting a stripe.<br />
<br />
RESULT 1-0 to Dell19<br />
<br />
Frame 2<br />
<br />
Dell pots the first 3 spots.  BCLG pots a stripe  then misses another easy stripe to leaves DEll with a tough pot on a spot.  everyones missing the easy shots this frame as dell misses a relatively straight forward spot. BCLG just misses leaving the stripe over the pocket.  its scrappy play as all the balls are centered around one corner.  BClg misses a long spot allowing Dell to clear up.<br />
<br />
RESULT 2-0 to Dell 19<br />
<br />
Frame 3<br />
BCLG100 pots the first ball of the game a stripe.  BCLG goes on to pot the next 5 stripes and one spot while hes at it.  one poor shot by BCLG results in a foul however then Dell gest a lucky miss resulting in BCLG giving him another foul. dell misses again however leaves his ball blocking the black. he then snookers BCLG resulting in yet another fould being given away. BCLG misses an easy pot on the black.  in the end Dell tries a risky pot on the last blue resulting in a medium lenght pot for BCLG to finnally pot the black.<br />
<br />
RESULT<br />
2-1 to Dell19<br />
<br />
Overview<br />
A reasonable match from my point of view im not sure what dell thinks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frame 1<br />
<br />
I can't really remember what happened in this frame. All I know is that I started decently but then missed a shot and Dell just didnt stop on his rampage of hitting them in :p<br />
<br />
Result 1-0 to Dell19<br />
<br />
Frame 2 <br />
<br />
I started pretty good but once again I miss and Dell19 takes advantage of it. He was aiming at the 8 ball when I got a very lucky break! He had a really nice shot but he hit the 8 ball AND the cue ball into the pockets. I won and I had 3 balls left!<br />
<br />
Result 1-1 Tied<br />
<br />
Frame 3<br />
<br />
Dell got 2 to start but then I got 4 straight. Then he got 3 straight. For the math impaired, he was ahread by 1. I then sunk 2 and he sunk 2. But, he sunk red one (:p) AND the cue ball. This enabled me to sink the orange one and 8 ball since I had a good position!<br />
<br />
Result 2-1 WildFire<br />
<br />
Thoughts!<br />
<br />
I should've lost 3-0 lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dell19</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I probably didn't deserve to win the first game against BCLG...</div></div><hr />

ill start drawing up a table now. ill use my way first and then change it to gainy's way if people would rather use that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dell19</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2004, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We could use both systems although I'm not sure how seriously people want to take this and there is always the problem that whichever current system that we use, people who play more will lead. Either they will eventually gain more points or have won more games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BCLG100</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2004, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well we could have a rule saying that you cant play another person twice until the majority has played the majority of other people.  therefore the points wont really be counted until afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WildFire</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2004, 04:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about you can only play twice in 24 hours or something..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2004, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we need a more organized standings. <br />
<br />
i.e., all series are 3 games.<br />
A win/loss record will be kept after each series is played. <br />
<br />
We could play in a semi-roundrobin fashion to play our series.<br />
<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
	BCLG		Chieftess	CivGeneral	WildFire<br />
BCLG	X		1		2		3<br />
CT	1		X		3		4<br />
CG	2		3		X		1<br />
WF	3		4		1		X<br />
<br />
The numbers would be the series. So, BCLG's first series (with a first series &quot;by-series) is against me, then CG, then WF. My first one is against BCLG, then a break, then CG and WF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dell19</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2004, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The (potential) problem with both solutions is that they assume that everyone can play reasonably the same amount of games, something like the current Yahoo rankings might be better and we could use the same system that is used to calculate rankings in chess rankings so that there is less benefit to playing lots of games if you tend to lose most of them.</div></div><hr />

Mid-way through the game, Dell started making errors such as bad shots, and knocking the cue ball into the pocket. Several lucky shots were made that game, including Chieftess getting out of a jam. The first game went to Chieftess.<br />
<br />
CT 1 - Dell 0<br />
<br />
<br />
Game 2 - This game started off well, with Chieftess getting ball after ball in the pocket. Dell was doing ok too, until Dell pocketed the 8-ball by ricocheting the cueball off another ball.<br />
<br />
CT 2 - Dell 0<br />
<br />
Game 3 - Chieftess' luck started running out early on, with Dell getting ball after ball in, but still making some mistakes. Chieftess nearly had the game in hand until a tricky shot occured at the end, a miscue so to speak in trying to wedge the cueball under a solid (CT's color). Chieftess wasn't able to capitalize on Dell's mistakes this game, and it quickly went to Dell. <br />
<br />
CT 2 - Dell 1</div></div><hr />

<br />
1st Frame<br />
BCLG potted a few balls, then Perfection. BCLg was first to the black even though Perfection was hitting someoutrageous shots.  BCLG ends up potting the black in the left centre pocket.  All the time cheered on positively by Perfection ;)<br />
<br />
Frame 2<br />
Perfection first to down a stripe.  tenser frame than the first one.  Perfection taking pity and potting 2 of BCLG's balls in quick succession.  Perfection is in the lead with 5 balls to go.  BCLg misses an easy pot which could have left him on the black its one ball apiece. BCLG misses on the black leaving a tough long pot for Perfection. which he pots but then misses on the black leaving a farly straight forward pot for BCLG.<br />
<br />
Frame 3<br />
Perfection does his super-ultra-back-break however this means nothing to BCLG who pots the first ball, a stripe then goes and pots another 3 before perfection pots one. and then the next 3.  its 4 all with 3 balls left. BCLg downs one. with only 2 left he downs his 2 and one of PErfections in one shot. before missing an easy pot on the black.  Perfection is making it hard for BCLG to close out the game.  however he slips up and BCLG pots home a long black<br />

Its based on the order of the results so we don't necessarily have to play 3 games against each person but it does mean that it is necessary for people to post the order of their results.<br />

The link is here:<br />
http://chess.cern.ch/ratings/elocalc.en.shtml<br />
<br />
The only extra adjustment is changing the progress coefficient that we can just change as it is with chess. Everyone also starts at a ranking of 1000 so if you slip below 1000 then you are probably doing worse than average.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyways<br />
BCLG100 VS (the finnally fixed java of ) Gainy_bo<br />
<br />
Frame 1<br />
BCLG100 pots the first 2 spots before Gainy hits right back and pots the next 2 stripes.  BCLG then proceeds to pot the nesxt 3 stripes before missing a ball over the pocket allowing gainy to pot one ball. then Gainny fould sresulting in a miss from BCLG100 and the potting of one of gainy's stripes.  before gainy misses a shot he made tricky by trying to be cocky ;).  bclg then proceeds to pot home the final 2 balls and the black.<br />
<br />
Frame 2<br />
<br />
BCLG takes an early 4 ball lead on Gainy before GAiny finanally gets out of his seat and pots a whole 1 ball, then for some reason deciding to hit the hardest shot known to man and surprisingly he misses ;) BCLG then pots the next 2 balls leaving his final ball hanging on the pocket.  Gainy gets back to the table and pots home his second of the frame then his third, then deciding to snooker BCLG, on purpose of course ;)  BCLG somewhow pots th ball however leaves a tricky black.  he however like a retard forgets to change the arrow on the last shot resulting in a win for GAiny.<br />
<br />
Frame 3<br />
<br />
Gainy pots the first ball a spot then the second, BCLg hits back with a long pot sinking his first of the frame.  then with 2 more long pots he is one ball up.  Gainy goes for the impossible pot and misses allowing BCLG to sink another stripe. he then misses a sitter leaving a tricky pot for gainy who misses.  BCLG pots again and hes now 5-2 up.  gainy pots one and over the 2 shots goes through a period of hooning the ball whenever possible ;).  BCLG misses a trickey double allwoing gainy to easily slit home a red bringing every other ball into contention. bclg then misses his final bal after it was over the pocket allwing gainy to pot his remaingingballs. but he doesnt and leaves BCLG a tricky snooker, BCLG gets out of it however leaves a shot open.  GAiny pots this but pots BCLG's ball as well not a foul in yahoo pool.  he then pots his ball however gainy's need to hoon results in him potting the white.  allowing BCLG to easily pot the black.<br />
<br />
result 2-1<br />
1st frame BCLG<br />
2nd Frame GAiny<br />
3rd Frame BCLG</div></div><hr />

<br />
1st Game:<br />
<br />
Pretty even. Can't remember how it started, but I had a flurry of potting right at the end and won :)<br />
<br />
2nd Game:<br />
<br />
Looked bad for me. Dell started off with about 3 in a row. I got one or two back, but then he furthered his lead. I again got one or two back, and with both of us having a few left to pot, Dell managed to pot the black :D So I won.<br />
<br />
3rd Game:<br />
<br />
I started off potting 5, along with a few safety shots. I just missed one, which allowed Dell to get 3 back (in a row). Got a bit scrappy after that, with Dell managing to draw level. I got onto the black, and missed a moderately difficult shot. Which allowed Dell to draw level again. The tension got the better of me, and I tapped the ball for no apparent reason. This allowed Dell to place the ball infront of the black, and he finished off a dramatic game ;) Victory for Dell.<br />

1st Game<br />
It was close. Can't remember much about it, so there's not much to say ;) I won in the end though. It could have gone either way.<br />
<br />
2nd Game<br />
It wasn't as close this time, I potted the black when CT had 3 balls left. I won.<br />
<br />
3rd Game<br />
Lasted about 15 seconds at the most. I took the break, and on CT's shot, she managed to pot the black. Didn't see how she did it, but I don't mind ;) Hence, I won.<br />

I took quite a big lead, 5 balls in a row. Wf came back, I made a stupid attempt at a pot, WF won.<br />

Again, close. Again, I did something quite extravegant (when going for the black). I potted WF's last ball, and literally set the black up right on the pocket edge. Wf, being the jobby he is (;)) managed to pot both the black and the white. I won :)<br />

<br />
so 1st plays 4th<br />
and 2nd plays 3rd<br />
this could be over more frames such as 5<br />
<br />
and then the final over 7 frames.  we could also have a third place play off if everyone wanted it.<br />
<br />
so what does everyone think?<br />
<br />
After completing that we could go from there. whther to re[eat the way weve done, have one big tournament, get new players or just stop alltogether.</div></div><hr />

Gainy raced into the lead and looked like he would win but then a difficult black was missed and Dell came back to pot several balls and win<br />
<br />
2nd Game:<br />
<br />
Pretty much the opposite of the first game with me reaching a reasonable lead but then a foul let Gainy come back and clinch the game.<br />

3rd Game:<br />

Another close game but without anyone taking a huge lead. Gainy nearly came back in the game but this time the comeback did't happen with the black being potted by me and giving me only my second win.<br />

<br />
The first game went hit-for-hit with Anarchy taking a slight lead before Chieftess started knocking her balls in one after another. Chieftess got some lucky breaks and eventually won the game.<br />
<br />
Game 2 - Chieftess 1 - Anarchy 1<br />
<br />
This game started off strangely. Chieftess knocked in a solid ball, but the game didn't register it as such. Only after knocking in a striped one did it register. Towards the end, the game became a defensive match, with each player making well-timed-shots. It was only when Chieftess' shot failed to cleanly go in the pocket did Anarchy take the opportunity to win the game.<br />
<br />
Game 3 - Chieftess 2 - Anarchy 1<br />
<br />
This game started off a bit slowly, with both players missing the pocket. Chieftess got a string of balls in, leaving anarchy with quite a few on the table. Anarchy took his time, making some defensive shots as he went along, allowing him to aim for the 8-ball, only to miss. This allowed Chieftess to win the game!</div></div><hr />

WildFire 1 - Chieftess 0<br />
<br />
Basically I did very good at the beginning and won :D<br />
<br />
Game 2<br />
<br />
WildFire 1 - Chieftess 1<br />
<br />
I started pretty bad but picked it up but it didnt matter because CT turned her uber Ha&gt;&lt; on and made some gh3y shots.<br />
<br />
Game 3<br />
<br />
WildFire 2 - Chieftess 1<br />
<br />
Basically it was one I shouldve won anyway as I was winning 5-1 very quickly. Then I fell apart (she was hackin again ;)) and lost. But wait...lost? NO! She sunk the 8 ball AND the cue ball!<br />
<br />
Victory is mine!!</div></div><hr />

anyways i had to edit the table cos with anarchy losing so much i accidently said ed played one more game than what he had of.  anyways could we try and get these amtches finished so we can start on the playoff's or the such like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Game 1<br />
<br />
Began with some trading of pots but I pulled out a three ball lead only to nearly lose it as CivG came back and then I made a trademark foul as I potted the black and the white to lose the game.<br />
<br />
Game 2<br />
<br />
Like the first game I went into the last stage with a reasonable lead, again CivG closed the gap but this time the black went in and the white stayed out.<br />
<br />
Game 3<br />
<br />
This time a much larger lead was opened up and a miss by CivG allowed me to pot my last ball and then the black to win the game. <br />
<br />
Dell19 2 - 1 CivG<br />
<br />
Not sure whether I can actually gain a playoff place since if me and Chieftess win our remaining games then we would all be level on points. I'm a little confused how WF has played 7 games yet has 4 wins and 2 defeats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you end up level on points then it will go down to frame difference then if still level down to frames won, then if still level, well that will just be awkward.</div></div><hr />

2-1<br />
i lost to some of the luckiest play i have ever seen.<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
i missed the black by a slight margin leaving it over the pocket, giving NRK a tough long pot.  he misses the original shot by a mile to the bottom corner pocket, he then however rbounds of 2 cushions both balls moving to hit the blue into the opposite center pocket.</div></div><hr />

I don't see the point of these. If someone finishes first, why not just accept they are first? Play offs defeat the purpose of having a league, assuming that the positions are clearly marked.<br />
<br />
What I suggest is a tournament. We've got 8 players, which means there are enough. It could be like:<br />
<br />
1)Bclg vs Perfection<br />
2)Gainy vs Dell19<br />
3)Wildfire vs CivGeneral<br />
4)Chieftess vs Anarchy<br />
<br />
winner of 1 would then play winner of 3, winner of 4 would then play winner of 2 etc.<br />
This tournament would be based of the final rankings of the league, which would make it as fair as possible.<br />
What does everyone think?</div></div><hr />

which was pretty much what i was suggesting cept with 4 people  :rolleyes:  i didnt bring it up again i just always asumed that we were going to do it anyways seeing how no-one disagreed to it when i mentioned it when i was top of the league by about 3 or 4 points :p so it didnt really matter where i was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What i'm suggesting doesn't affect the league. So it's not :p<br />
And by your logic of &quot;No-one disagreed with it, so we must do it&quot;, you could equally say that &quot;No-one agreed with it, so we musn't do it&quot;.<br />
You only made a suggestion, which drew no positive remarks. If anything, there was a bit of negativity ;) Dell said he would rather stick with the chess rankings, and I said i'd rather have a proper standalone tournament.<br />
<br />
What is the point in having a league, if the winner is not actually the winner? Coming 1st then has no advantages to coming 4th. If Perfection won one more game than myself, I would have no issues with him winning the league.<br />
What is the point in playoffs? :confused:<br />
<br />

yer i like the idea of over 5, as over 3 sometimes luck can play a part, we could build it up as well, i.e. 5, 7, 9 quarters, semis, final.  but i dont know if everyone would want to play that much<br />

yer suuuuuuuuure ;) :p it does play some role, it depends who you play in the tourney, you could be against one of the better or worse players.  though were all fairly even,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, so the league doesn't matter for me since I had thought for a while that the top 4 went into the playoffs but since everyone does then there was less point in concentrating fully...</div></div><hr />
