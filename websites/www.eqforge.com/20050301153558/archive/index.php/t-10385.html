It appears about 25% of each age can be bypassed enroute the next age.    Has anyone tried this?   If I skip literacy and head for education, is there anything I can't build other than the Great Library?</div></div><hr />

I generally skip most of the stuff in the middle ages that are used only for wonders.  My current style of play nearly always leaves me behind in technology during the middle ages, so I have no option to build those particular wonders anyway.  (My current style of play might not be very good for that reason....)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Endureth</div><div class="date">Nov 28, 2001, 07:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my current game I had a very slight lead in tech so I went for the tech that give the Smith Trading Company (STC).  It was a good decision I think.  I wasn't able to get my research above 40% and I thought the extra money saved from STC would be a big help.  I was right, it helped a lot.  I was able to boost my tech rate to 50% (big difference, from about 12 turns per tech to about 8) and I'm really happy I did it.  Also after I was about half way through building STC I decided to start selling the tech to people which yielded a couple other non-essential but helpful techs.  I also gave it to France for free and it helped relations with her a lot.  Later on she agreed to team up with me against Egypt.  Egypt is almost dead now, I'm researching a little faster and it's all because I went for that non-essential tech.<br />
<br />
Of course next game I might not go for it, it all depends on how the game plays out, I might go for something else instead that will give me an edge somehow.<br />
<br />
I would recommend researching optional techs in two circumstances.  If your way behind (so you can trade them to get ahead) or if your way ahead.  If I think someone is neck and neck with me in research I'll stick to the straight and narrow path until I come up with a plan to best them.<br />

Yep, you are right there.   Since the original post, I have found a system that works pretty well.   Other than optional military advances, I let others build cultural advances (music, free artistry, etc.) and I try to buy them as soon as I get a notice that a new wonder is under construction somewhere.   I have cities which are good enough that I can usually win the race to the wonders, so I can afford the lag.   Meanwhile, I am trying to be 4-5 techs ahead of everyone else where it matters.    I want to take over the world before any opponent gets infantry.</div></div><hr />

ie.. Sanitation---hospitals<br />
Military Tradition--building armies and cavalry??<br />
Literacy greatly increases your research rate... i always have 100% end game<br />
Music Theory gives the best wonder IMO...<br />
Governments are all optional...(Monarchy, Communism, Democracy, Republic)...<br />
I think techs like free artistry should add to your national culture as well as allowing the shakespear theater to be built...(which sorta blows unless your an evil dude :)</div></div><hr />

I agree you need them.   But I think it is more efficient to be researching deep elsewhere and buy these when another Civ gets them.   In my most recent game, I didn't research music, but I bought it as soon as someone started on Bach.    I started on Bach the next turn and still got there first.   Meanwhile, I was off doing research in the Industrial Age.</div></div><hr />
