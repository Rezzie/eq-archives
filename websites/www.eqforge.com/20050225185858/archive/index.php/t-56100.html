We are about to reach all those goals so we must now look beyond.<br />
<br />
There are two parts to this poll.  One specifically deals with priorities of how to deal with unit unhappiness in Democracy.  This may have an impact on our research plans and thus deserves special mention.  The second section deals with general research priorities.<br />
<br />
Unit unhappiness<br />
We have 6 units that will cause two unhappy heads in their home cities in Democracy:  Five triremes and the elephant near Ipec.<br />
The science ministry sees 3 ways to deal with this unit unhappiness once we are in democracy:  We will probably do all of these at some time, but please choose one as our highest priority strategy now.<br />
<br />
<br />
A1 – Magnetism + Leos<br />
- Magnetism allows galleons which do not cause unit unhappiness. (The Elephant can either have a fort built around him or move into a city like Ipec.)  Completing Leo’s is necessary to upgrade the triremes to Galleons.  Also allows offshore sailing and faster ships.<br />
<br />
A2 – Theology + Bach<br />
- Bach’s cathedral makes two unhappy citizens content, and is applied after the unit unhappiness, so each city can support one unit abroad without any additional unhappiness.  Also reduces unhappiness in other cities.<br />
<br />
A3 – Rehome units to Doughnutia/Shakepeare’s Theatre <br />
 - Because Dou has Shakespeare’s theatre, it can support units without any unhappiness.  We could rehome the units to Dou, thus freeing the other cities from the unhappiness.  This is not recommended for several reasons:  It draws resources away from our SSC at a time when shields are scarce;  the units would all have to travel to Dou first – a journey of many turns for most of these units; and even if it is not a priority, we do anticipate getting both Magnetism and Leos soon, so eventually the triremes will not cause unhappiness meaning the SSC will be supporting those units unnecessarily.<br />
<br />
<br />
General Research Goals<br />
We are on the doorstep of Feudalism, Navigation, and Gunpowder.  <br />
<br />
Each could be considered an objective on its own, plus they each lead to other options.<br />
<br />
Feudalism leads to Theology and Chivalry (Suntzu, Bach, Knights).  Feudalism and chivalry are possibly available for trade from other Civs.<br />
<br />
Navigation leads to Atomic Theory, Magnetism, and Steam engine (Magellan, Galleons, Ironclads, Eiffel Tower :rolleyes: )<br />
<br />
Gunpowder leads to Explosives and Metallurgy (Muskets, Cannons, Engineers)<br />
<br />
<br />
Vote for ONE of the three “A” options, and vote for THREE of the “B” options.</div></div><hr />
