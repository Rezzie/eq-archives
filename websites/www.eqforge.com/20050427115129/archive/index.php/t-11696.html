<br />
There's a prize to all winning possibilities, except histographic!<br />
<br />
So let's aplaude EzekielKnight (66th) for the highest score (1565) in histographic victory for Civ 3 GOTM 01!<br />

I was reading the Apolyton Tournament and there they can play how many times they want (really weird rule, they're all about score). So, not knowing the huge bonus you get with early conquest victory, the guy played the hole game till 2050 to get the maximum score (since your score is always growing). When he find out about the bonus he came back and won the game with a 100ad conquest if I'm not mistaken. In the end he only got 300-400 points more than the histographic victory. Also, most conquests after 300ad got a smaller score than his histograph. Another case for instance would be, if you're in the 20th century, and you didn't finished the game yet, you're probably gonna get a better score by histograph than by any other victory condition, and that could be your goal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Dec 10, 2001, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That guy from Apolyton abviously played worse the game after his first. If he ended the game his first game straight away, he probably got more then 1000 points more.<br />
<br />
When you end by reaching 2050 AD, your score is only the average score of all previous turns. When you end sooner, it's still the average, plus a bonus. The average is ofcourse lower, because at the beginning everyone performs the same.<br />
<br />
but ending the game when you can always gives a higher score. Therefore, that's the goal to strive to. If you can't end before 2050, you failed in that. Thus, it's not worth an award.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, I suspect there will be fewer entries this time around?<br />
<br />
We can only play once with no disk magic - it seems like a waste to even bother sending the file in if you don't choose to go the conquest victory...</div></div><hr />

Well...i consider the diplomatic victory a failure in winning by any other way too, and it has an award! ;)<br />

As you can see in this post, it seems that are people who do think that way! Besides the histographic win is the only winning possibility that can't be turned &quot;off&quot;, so if you would make such a scenario only possible winning by ending in a certain year with the highest score, the histograph would be the only winning possibility! ;)<br />

<br />
&quot;We don't make goals&quot; =&gt; Then what the diplomatic, culture, conquest and domination victories are? You guessed: goals! ;)<br />
<br />
By giving these victories awards you are making them goals, so it's only natural that you give an award to the histographic victory too! Besides i don't think anyone would start the game thinking: &quot;I'm going to try to win diplomatic&quot;. I think this because it just takes too long and it doesn't give that many score! So, they can win faster and with more score other ways! But, giving the diplomatic victory an award, it was made a goal, and as a consequence: diplomatic victory was given a valid way to win and get an award! So, why not giving it too, to the histographic! I think the histographic it's subject of an award because of those who weren't able to win by SS or UN, but didn't let the AI do it too, specially in higher difficult levels, which is laudable! ;)<br />

<br />
I still see a histographic victory as a failure and about the &quot;goals&quot; I was talking about: I ment that Firaxis made these ways of victories to win the game, but the &quot;histographic win&quot; is just to prevent the game from going on and on. At least, that's my guess. But it doesn't matter. If you want an award for histographic win - why not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Awards page lists an award for fastest finish - this should say fastest victory, since you've clearly awarded it to the fastest person to win the game, since the fastest finisher came last in the rankings (defeat in 540BC I believe). :)<br />
<br />
Either that or you made a genuine mistake in awarding the fastest finisher prize, in which case I expect some &quot;retired in 4000BC&quot; entries in the next GOTM just to win the fastest finisher award. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
What not an award for the highest score in a respectable loss! (ie. any loss but a conquest loss)<br />
I would have won that.<br />
<br />
It seems silly to be asking for things like this. (I certainly wouldn't want  a medal for my loss).<br />
<br />
Our foremost concern is limiting the power of the conquest victory. <br />
<br />
No more medals, unless you give a second place for all those other type (cultural, space, domination, diplo), this would be an incentive to not take the conquest victory. I'm sure the next GOTM that is friendly to early conquest is going to have a great majoriy of conquest victories.</div></div><hr />

And you may not retire before 2050 AD, so the fastest way to finish would be to find an enemy a.s.a.p. and then leave your one city without defence. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Nope... just disband your first settler;) <br />
Count me in, my score is 0:goodjob: <br />
<br />
