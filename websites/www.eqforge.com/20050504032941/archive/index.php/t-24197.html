<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2002, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This idea was brought up by Philippe in the Civ3 Demogame (the Spice Trader's Guild in the citizen's sub thread). And it has been talked about between me and Disorganizer.<br />
<br />
What is a Mission (or Challenge) GOTM, you ask? It's a twist on the standard GOTM, where you have certain objectives. These objectives would include things like:<br />
<br />
Aussie Expansion<br />
Mission: Conquer Australia and South America on Marla's World Map.<br />
Catch: You start in Australia, and play on deity (or emporer)<br />
<br />
Tame the Jungle<br />
Mission: Start of in the center of a jungle mini-continent, while other civs start on a super continent with plentiful resources.<br />
<br />
Catch: (some catch, or challenge would be made - jungles might be a challenge enough!).<br />
<br />
Claim the Resources<br />
Mission: Claim all resources of one type. (I think TF's spice pun in the GOTM8 thread spawned this whole thing) :)<br />
<br />
Catch: The last few resources would be owned by an agressive civ, who is given time to grow.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, what does everyone think? We could make a few test runs to see how it works.</div></div><hr />

so we could do a GOTM8 mission<br />
AND a new map mission.<br />
i am willing to check the savegames and organising and maybe with some help if it can to put this challenge toghether.<br />
is there anyone who is interrested in creating maps?<br />
i will problably make some maps and somebody looks at it and if he thinks its fine we could do a mission about it.</div></div><hr />
