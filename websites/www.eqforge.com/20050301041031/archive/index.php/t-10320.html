<br />
I'm on my fourth game since getting CivIII, im playing on Warlord, huge map, pangea, warm, wet, 16 civs.  I was playing for a while, as the persians, started science brokering for gold per turn..... I started to get crowed so I just finished a war with the french (got 3 cities or so).  I have the most advanced tech (recently pulled ahead with the SB), a nice army of knights and an average sized empire. <br />
<br />
The Zulus were my closest competitor until recently.  They built some wonders I wanted and they are just too agressive for my liking, but too far away for me to diectly confront (other side of continet, few civs in the way).  So I decided to go to war with them, then use my diplomatic pull (from the SBing) to get all their neighbors to attack them and just carve up their empire.<br />
<br />
I decided to do this with a classic &quot;demand something they are not going to give in a million years&quot; then declare war.  <br />
<br />
So I demand 1 followed by as many zeros as I can fit gold per turn (100,000,000).  Of course i expect them to say &quot;no way&quot; but When I actuallly take the time to read their response they give me &quot;we will comply because it would cost more to go to war with you&quot;  I couldnt believe my eyes.....  I then checked my gold profits per turn and sure enough it increased by 100,000,000.  One hundred million per turn in 650 AD? Wow.  I then let one turn go to see if they could actually pay me, and somehow, they managed to pay me; I had 100,000,000+ gold!!!  I checked their capitol afterwards and it looked like all of their improvemnts were sold (except granery and barracks because they had pyramids and sun tzus).  Though there was no way in hell they could come up with that much gold..... <br />
<br />
As nice as it is to have practically infinate gold This brings a serious AI bug, and a serious gold bug up.  First somehow the AI was willing to give me 100,000,000 gold per turn, and secondly, they somehow borrowed 99,999,000 gold to pay me for the first turn.  <br />
<br />
I didn't continue playing after this because I didnt have time, but wow, im not kidding you guys here, I have the saved game on my other computer.  <br />
<br />
I just want to know what you guys think of this.  I was AMAZED</div></div><hr />
