Both new cities are building warriors, and LP needs a new build after its Phalanx is finished next turn, what shall we build in these cities?<br />
We also have a problem with RF, it'll grow (to 3) in 5 and it will riot if left alone.</div></div><hr />

It will heal whilst we wait for another warrior to be built, then it can continue to explore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone has voted not to build a settler in LC, what does that person think we should build there instead. Just because I haven't added an &quot;other&quot; option, it doesn't mean we don't want to know about other thoughts:)<br />
<br />
What about our SSC?<br />
There are ideas about sending two settlers to the hill in the south with three visible specials (one hidden?) and a river. I think it's a perfect spot for an SSC, maybe except for the hill, but with the extra production we'll finish wonders faster in the beginning:)  I'd suggest using the RF settler, and a settler from LC to found the city, and then found the second city close to ellie or NW of SSC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was about to not vote for LC Settler too... we need the police.<br />
<br />
I see what you mean now.  Build the Warrior, then vote Settler?, right?  Then since I voted serf River, next serf goes onto Silk?<br />
<br />
Ditto Ipec, finish Warrior, then build Settler ... sounds ok to me.<br />
<br />
RF is a problem.  Work Buffalo, Settler in 7, then build a Warrior?<br />
<br />
LP seems also a problem.  Finish Phx, but if we're going to send it to Neumatic, we need another police before it grows to 2.  If we keep the Phx in LP, and build Settler, it'll finish and disappear before it gets to Size=2.  So, work the Fish a couple turns. ???</div></div><hr />
