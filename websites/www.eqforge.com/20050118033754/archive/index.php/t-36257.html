A Shuttle, an MSI, or an ASUS? It seems that this mini pc concept has been a really huge success (Shuttle confirms 250K+ XPC boxes sold this year), probably thanks to:<br />
_ the success of LAN parties<br />
_ they're very silent and not noisy<br />
_ what's small is cute (excepted for certain things :D)<br />
<br />
It was bad that so far, only the S551G had an AGP port, and runs Pentium 4 chips, quite expensive. But the SN41 is to be released soon, with AMD support, AGP, firewire, nForce 2, dualhead connector, etc... Yum :) Looking forward to seeing that one.</div></div><hr />

Nothing to upgrade, nothing to play around with inside, nothing to really customize. So nothing for me. :mischief:<br />
<br />
But speaking of small PCs, what I really want and eagerly await is an affordable Tablet PC!!! :yeah:<br />
You gotta love those smaller and lighter notebook-like PCs, in it´s huge variety of types and features. Instead of carrying around tons of stacks of paper at university and/or work, one of those cuties is just what I need. :love:<br />
<br />
Even though I know that the industry standard, especially the digital writing software comes from :satan: Microsoft :flamedevi , if it works as advertised, I must say that this is the thing they have done right in the last 10 years. :mischief:<br />

<br />
Maybe I should wish for one for Christmas.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah even a Mac is a Personal Computer :p<br />
<br />
Well according to interviews it's a success because it is as powerful as a real system (AGP, P4, lot of firewire and other slots...) and very small for lan parties...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeratain</div><div class="date">Nov 11, 2002, 03:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think small is bad. The smaller cases leave your computer vulnerable to overheating due to lack of ventilation and of course because its cramped.<br />
<br />
You have a lot less room for upgrades and new peripherals, ie: CD Rom, Zip Drive, CD Burner, DVD drive, etc.<br />
<br />
If you want a mini PC, just buy a laptop :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Nov 11, 2002, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just read the numerous reviews about the Shuttle.. Max CPU heat = 48°C.... The heat pipe technology is working wonderfully.<br />
Plus, a laptop doesn't have a GF4600 or a R9700 ;)</div></div><hr />

I am waiting for the one that I can slap an AMD XP chip in AND upgrade the video card. I am alos thinking about getting some for servers. They would be great for when I host LAN parties.</div></div><hr />
