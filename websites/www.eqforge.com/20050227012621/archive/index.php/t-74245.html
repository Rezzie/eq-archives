	To complete spaceship ASAP to land in the shortest time<br />
	Freight delivery to increase science and buy SS parts.<br />
<br />

<br />
1834: Discover FT 8, Pop +133 mil, Trade €1684, IPRB SS parts, Bribe barbs for €102<br />
<br />
Chinese governmnet overthrown. Guerilla uprising near Pharsalos. 14 units plus stack.<br />
<br />
Plan update: The area is pretty much undefended. Hopefully the few spies we have in nearby 'China' can contain things. Plan to increase spy production and build new cities to fill in the gaps.<br />
<br />
1836: Discover FT 9, Pollution near Rheims and Bangalore, Pop +134 mil, Trade €252, IPRB SS parts, Bribe 2 barbs for €102 and 3 for €123. One convert kills barb stack of 10 units! Leader of first uprising captured giving €150.<br />

<br />
Chinese settler spied leaving city. Can't be bribed because of democracy, don't want to attack and lose peace bonus. With units in their current positions, it shouldn't be able to move further because of ZOC.<br />
<br />
1843: Discover FT 13, Many WLTP days, Manhattan Project complete, Trade €859, Gewurztraminer and Shiraz founded.<br />
<br />

<br />
My Curse of the Barbarians from the D+2 succession game re-appreared, but I managed to contain things. Only 5 turns left – so I guess we want to deliver as many vans as possible and increase luxuries again to maximise our happiness score.<br />
<br />
Who's up next? If no-one can play before-hand, I can play Thursday aftenoon GMT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jan 05, 2004, 06:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The barbs seems to be gone (almost, the last one can consider him/herself bribed). And we have new cities, I guess we can get a few extra points by just planting cities where the engineers are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Jan 05, 2004, 11:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As long as we don't have any pollution to worry about, all the Engineers can be built into cities, or, they can be added to any city that is less than size 8.<br />
<br />
Do we have any troops that are causing unhapiness?<br />
Any cities without a Chourthouse?  Marketplace? Bank? or any that need a Stock Exchange?<br />
<br />
Ideally we will have all the Engineers turned back into population points and Luxuries maxed out on the last turn.<br />
<br />
We have 4 active players, so maybe we should have each person play one turn for now?  or do we just want to end it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Old n Slow</div><div class="date">Jan 06, 2004, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that one turn each would be fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jan 06, 2004, 12:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree on one turn each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Jan 06, 2004, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">who takes it next then?<br />
<br />
