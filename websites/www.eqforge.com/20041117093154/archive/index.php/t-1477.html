<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dark X 101</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2001, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, that the beauty of it. They are Super RailRoads, but they can only go one direction http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/blushing.gif....BUT I have a solution! Make the mountain graphix look like roads, after that lay out your mountian/road graphix, then put airbases on the mountian/roads, and finally, make the airbase graphic invisible. I think this is a good trick because 1) It makes easy to defend roads (Stacked units). 2) You can move on them like RailRoads. and 3) It adds protection from  airborn things because you know where they landed and you can zip right to 'em. The food is just an extra bonus. All in all, I like the idea, and I'll use it in one of my scenarios. (I'm making one right now, 8 Civs counting the Barbs, it's a fantasy. I might not submit it to the site, but only time will tell http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif...)<br />

I'm just saying: be careful of the side effects of airbases. They have been used before in middle ages scens as villages, and very successfully because of the stacking and production bonuses. I'm not sure if they would work as well as anything else.</div></div><hr />

CLEVER! Good substitute for the SDI too (if you don't have the tech yet). Just keep them empty all the time, and wait for them to change color!</div></div><hr />

AI Missiles don't move through tiles the way human controled ones do.  They just suddenly appear in the square next to your city and boom!  Thus you must make the airbase in the tiles directly next to your city, if you leave space between the ring and your city you will gain no defence against nukes and CMs.</div></div><hr />
