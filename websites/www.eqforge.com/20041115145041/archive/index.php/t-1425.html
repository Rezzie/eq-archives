<br />
*****<br />

A few things to add: The Mustang should have better range and endurance, or it is no better than the 190, and that is not right. It couldn't go the distances of a p-38, but it could come close. Also, you didn't correct the Gloster Meteor thing, is still reads Glouchester. Still it's a load of fun, and your units add a lot to the game.<br />

<br />
I must admit, the time of the scenario which captured imagination and theory of mind has finally given way to the presentation...it's now a competitive world out there for scenario and modpack graphists, sound mixers, and designers...without meaning to be...<br />
<br />
Sadly, it may limit the number of &quot;well designed&quot; scenarios to an elite authorship...<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you may be right about the number of WWII scenarios out there...a lot of different takes on that scenario...<br />

Hey, Kobayashi, any new scenarios planned? Just wondering, you know...&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />
<br />
Thanks for asking. I've just been sulking a bit (and visiting the chess forum). ZWK didn't really take off and I've been wondering if there was something fundamentally wrong with it or that there are just too many WWII scenarios out there.<br />
 <br />
Seems that 'looks' do matter and I've learned that a lot of people look at the terrain in great detail for some reason. I have never been a 'terrestial' scenario designer and I never realised that. I've been spending my time giving ZWK one last try by giving it a face lift. <br />
<br />
So I have made changes in response to the comments by some of the old timers. Since, I've already gone rapidly from 1.0 to 1.1 to 1.3, I don't think I'll release the next version yet cause suggestions for changes keep popping up once in a while. When I am satisfied nothing else needs changing, I will release the final 2.0 version. <br />
<br />
In the meanwhile, if anyone has previously downloaded vesion 1.3, I would be happy to e-mail the few 'facelift' files. Just e-mail me or leave your request (plus e-mail address) on this thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
As extracted from the readme:<br />
<br />
9.05 VERSION 2.0 CHANGES<br />
------------------------<br />
a. I have moved some of the terrain and added two two new terrain types, grove and beach.<br />
<br />
b. Most of the terrain bonuses have been changed so that they are more appropriate. <br />
<br />
c. Trade items have been changed to different basic minerals and elements.<br />
<br />
d. The look of the transport corridor (road) has also been adjusted so it will not be mistaken for railroad.<br />
<br />
e. Tanks over forty tons (Panther, Tiger, Tiger II, Stalin and Pershing) can now ignore city fortifications.<br />
<br />
f. Created advice files so that the advisors are more effective and explain what units and improvements are for.<br />
<br />
g. Both Soviet and Axis AI are more likely to declare war as the scenario progresses.<br />
<br />
h. The game doesn't say that Hess was planning to defect any more.<br />
<br />
plus the things that AlcibO has suggested above.<br />
