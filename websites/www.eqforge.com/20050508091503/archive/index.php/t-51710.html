<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Why are you running for the department you are running for?<br />
<br />
I feel my experience in posting polls, and with CIV3 will be valuable to the nation.<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
I am also running for science leader.  I would take the governor position over the science leader position.<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
I was one of the original players when the first demogame started, and have held various positions including domestic leader, president, VP, and foreign affairs leader.<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
I believe this should be up to the DP.<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
I helped write some of them.  On occasion, a particular interpretation of the laws can actually harm the game.  It is then the duty of government officials to do what they think is best.<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
I am a skilled civ3 player, and an experienced demogame player.<br />
<br />
7. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at? If not Monarch or higher, do you feel comfortable playing at an Monarch level in this game?<br />
<br />
I normally play on monarch with occasional forays into emperor.<br />
<br />
8. What plans and ideas do you have for your department during Term 1?<br />
<br />
I intend to lobby for immediate production of two settlers which will found 'settler factories' which will free our capital for wonder or military production while still allowing us to expand quickly.<br />
<br />
9. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term?<br />
<br />
No</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarn</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. Why are you running for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
I feel I can be of service to our nation through governorship.<br />
<br />
2. Are you running for 2 positions? If so, which ones? If you win both positions, which would you take?<br />
<br />
I am also running for Judge Advocate. I would take this one over it.<br />
<br />
3. What qualifications and experience do you have for the position you are running for?<br />
<br />
I have been in several Domestic positions (leader, deputy, governor, mayor) before in previous demogames. I also held a non- Domestic position (ambassador).<br />
<br />
4. How do you feel about turn-chats and is your position that they should continue as is, or do you favor the concept of private/closed door turn sessions by the DP? What about an offline turn 0 or prechat moves?<br />
<br />
Turn-chats are great.:goodjob: They should stay opened to everyone, but the DP should have final say.<br />
<br />
5. Are you familiar with all of our laws? When is it appropriate to not follow the laws?<br />
<br />
I knew most of them and the ones I get confused with, I just look up. Usually, one should stay within the laws, except when it ruins the demogame itself.<br />
<br />
6. Explain in one sentence why the citizens should vote for you instead of your opponents.<br />
<br />
I have been in the demogame for a while. I know how to run this office. <br />
<br />
7. What plans and ideas do you have for your province during Term 1?<br />
<br />
I plan on expanding the empire as quickly as possible like in any civ game. Create 'scouts,' and settlers. A setter factory is a must. Plus we should get some workers out early for road building.<br />
<br />
8. What difficulty level do you normally play the Civilization 3 game at?<br />
<br />
Monarch mostly<br />
<br />
<br />
11. If offered a leader position and a governor position, which would you take?<br />
<br />
Governor for now. I might take other positions later.<br />
<br />
12. Do you have any planned leave of absence during this term? <br />
<br />
No.</div></div><hr />
