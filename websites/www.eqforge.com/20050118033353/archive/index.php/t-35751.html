<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Nov 04, 2002, 01:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just downloaded opera a week ago and :goodjob: . I like the bar below showing loaded pages and the fact that I don't have to see all the commercials popping up (I sometimes have 10 windows with the same commercial:( ) . <br />
I have found two problems with this browser that works in IE:<br />
1. Since I have broadband, I connect to internet by filling in username and password on a homepage. Then this page pop ups a window where I can log out. <br />
First I would like my username and password to be filled in or shown in a list to easier log in, like in IE6. For the moment I have to fill in a long username and an odd password, which is hard to remember. Is this possible?<br />
Second, the window where I can log out doesn't popup unless I change that option in preferences. I want to have certain servers where popups are available, is it possible?<br />
2. I can't log in to my bank with opera, I can't download the certificates. I have chosen that the browser should say it's IE5 and not opera, but my bank still sense it. Are certificates possible to use in Opera, or do I have to use IE for this service?<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how can solve these problems?:)</div></div><hr />

About pop-ups, you can't stop only certain ones, for that you need a seperate program.  (I just use the built-in features in Zonealarm Pro)</div></div><hr />

Before I bought a router I used zonealarm, but it slowed down mycomputer too much so I didn't keep it, now I have a firewall in the router.:)</div></div><hr />
