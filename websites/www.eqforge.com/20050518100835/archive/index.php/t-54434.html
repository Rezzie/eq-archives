Note, we WILL determine the priority next. This is just to get an idea where we want our cities. Some cities, like the one between Penguinadua, and Inadatto is meant to be a &quot;Port City&quot;.<br />

<br />
I would like to take issue with your proposed site NW of Gorina.  I have attached the map from the previous discussion.  As you know, this post was originally in response to posts in that discussion.<br />
<br />
The Red Site is better for the following reasons:<br />
<br />
1. It is certain that we get the Iron by building it(immediate city radius).<br />
<br />
2. It has access to fresh water and can therefore be irrigated. It will take quite a few turns to get water to the Blue Site.<br />
<br />
3. Just walk a Settler to the Red Site and its built; Blue Site will take more turns.<br />
<br />
<br />
We can work to make sure that Gorina retains use of all of its tiles when it becomes a Size 20 powerhouse. Right now, time is of the essence(you say so yourself, CT) so we should be concentrating on which site can help us now.<br />
<br />
That site is the Red Site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 07:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You also mentioned setting our build priorities at this time.  I feel that the Red Site is very important now because it will give us access to the Iron without using up a worker.<br />
<br />
You seem to think that there is no immediate need for Iron and that we can just connect it should the need arise.  Is that when war is suddenly declared by one of our rivals?  Are we then to scramble to get reinforcements in place by connecting the Iron, routing our Warriors to a Barracks andrushing to stave off our enemy?  Or are we supposed to walk on eggshells at the diplomacy table because we are not prepared for a war?  <br />
<br />
We need to connect the Red Site now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oops.....it may help if I attach the image.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The blue site also connects the iron at once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It will take us longer to get there, plus there is no access to water.  These facts are most important of all.  The Blue site is not a consideration at this time.<br />
<br />
This one small shift should not significantly disrupt the Big Picture you have so skillfully laid out.  I agree with most of the layout, but we need to make this one small change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 28, 2003, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the blue site will hinder gorinas growth in the future. and there is NO advantage at all for that site except the river... which is a non issue at this time... the city planned there is only a filler for fast access to the iron... and it will be a production city rather than a population city...for the next decades at least.<br />
<br />
the river city could be built 1 tile EAST of the red spot so it would have a 2 tile gap to the blue spot and a 3 tile to gorina. but i could also go with ct's proposal 3 tiles away from the blue dot.<br />
<br />
(dont forget gorina will be a low-corruption top-pop city someday...)<br />
<br />
<br />
but i maybe have an alternative:<br />
does 1 tile nw of the blue dot also connect the iron?<br />
this would be 3 tiles from gorina and 2 tiles from nar shaddaa.</div></div><hr />
