*brought to you by term 2 Domestic Leader Fionn McCumhall<br />
<br />
Posted here are 4 maps detailing areas to expand to. Whether or not i win the current elections i think we should be discussing this.<br />
<br />
We should claim the remaining resources we currently see by cites capable of building settlers to do so. Those cities that cannot can focus on military, settler protection, and infrastructure.<br />
<br />
By claiming the resources and the rest of the continent we are assured dominance of the continent, plus we block the Greeks, Egyptians, Aztecs and those pesky Indians from taking precious land and resources. Plus these resources make good bargaining chips for trades. There are also the possibility of future resources to appear in the areas unsettled.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Post/blast/debate this issue to its death :D</div></div><hr />

Discuss the city placements. These are only ones i see that are ideal at the moment. I'm sure others might see another area they think is better</div></div><hr />

Do you have pics on your plans of the Grear Esquiline Canal ? <br />
<br />
Can you give a priority map ?</div></div><hr />

Northeast map: Where we can build depends on the Aztec settlers. We should block them and send them back before we can make a good choice. <br />
 <br />
<br />
Please note that there are two escorted settlers in that Aztec stack.  While we can prevent them from moving any further south or west, if Monty decides to settler where they are we cannot prevent it.  I agree that we must wait and see what the Aztecs do before finalizing any decisions in that area.<br />
<br />
Also, our citizens have voted to switch to monarchy.  When we do this will will face a period of anarchy wherein no settlers will be produced.  If we have a few settlers near completion we may well want to delay our revolution until they are ready.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately it is difficult to analyze placement of certain sites because the views are so zoomed in.  I've never seen the mountain rocks quite that close up before. ;)<br />
<br />
Priorities are noted for each map, note they are dominated by strategic resources:<br />
<br />
 Southeast sites A,B<br />
 Southwest sites A,B<br />
 Northeast, put a new site on the forest+river NW of the N'most Legion, and move site A 1NE.  Site E could be moved toward Noshuret, as placed there will be a gap of tiles too far to be worked by any city. <br />
 Northwest site B<br />
 <br />
Northeast Site E could be moved toward Noshuret, in its current location there will be a gap of tiles too far to be worked by any city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FionnMcCumhall</div><div class="date">Jul 01, 2003, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">THe highest priority map is Map 2 - the southeast unsettled area as it has the most unclaimed resources, followed closely by Map 1 Southwest area. I agree that the aztec situation must be dealt with once Monty decides where to place his settler, too bad we cant surround Montys settlers with legions to prevent further movement. Map 3 and 4 are the lowest priority even tho we have resources to grab. <br />
<br />
I also think we should start the settler production after the switch to manarchy which should more than likely last 6-8 turns at best</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FionnMcCumhall</div><div class="date">Jul 07, 2003, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">8 replys to this thread and half are mine! Come on people lets discuss city placement so we can place our settlers that we build.<br />
<br />
Another stragy i forgot to include but read in other thread in the forum is a tight build strategy which im all for as well, higher production and less curruption but the pitfalls are cities are not as big, anybody else up for this idea let me know and we can form up a new proposal with new maps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jul 07, 2003, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of your proposed locations have been put to use Fionn. In the NW unsettled map, I like the desert spot below &quot;C&quot;. In the NE map, I like the grassland location below &quot;C&quot;. In the SE map, I believe &quot;A&quot; should be our next spot. And in your SW map, I like &quot;B&quot;. That's four more cities. I think after the next four, we should consider slowing our Settler production some and concentrate on growth for some of our cities. Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FionnMcCumhall</div><div class="date">Jul 07, 2003, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree but i would rather fill out the continent then grow our cities up, just so we can make use of the FP a bit better, by picking a more centralized location in between the palace and FP</div></div><hr />
