<br />
The High Score HOF requires a minimum of 6 opponents on Large sized maps in order to meet the difficulty standards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, many games played as a GOTM are not in the HoF, despite sometimes very good or even best scores. :eek:<br />
<br />
I´m not sure whether it´s not allowed or not wanted, but they are 2 seperate things. I´d suggest playing HoF games additionally to the GOTM, they usually take more than 1 month to perfect.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

Besides if you have a game in GOTM that is higher than HOF records that should be good enough. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bamspeedy</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is correct, GOTM's are not eligible for the HoF.  One reason is that they don't want all the top scores to have been played on the same map.  That would be really boring to download all the top scores to see how people got their high score and every single map is the same.<br />
<br />
They set a minimum # of opponents, because back when they allowed tiny maps somebody played a game against ONE opponent.  The fewer civs allowed, the higher your scoring potential.  Whoever thought of only putting 5 AI into this large map :confused: .</div></div><hr />

What do you mean by perfect????????</div></div><hr />

Most of the HoF games are on huge maps (max scoring potential).  If you micromanage every city and don't use governors, trying to maximize the score, I can imagine it would take well over a month.<br />
<br />
JFL Dragon is thinking of allowing GOTM games to be in the HOF (provided the requirements are met, like # of civs).  We will probably be seperating the scores by difficulty level and map sizes, instead of just difficulty level like it is now.  So with different map sizes, GOTM games will be on the list much more frequently.  If we only seperate by difficulty level, the Gotm's would eventually not be on the list, as they don't have the same scoring potential as a huge map, which Gotm never plays.  I think only the warlord game (gotm6) had scores that would beat any of the top scores, but there have been many other games where scores would get on the list, some in the top 5.<br />
<br />
Note:  This decision isn't final, it's just being considered.  They may start accepting GOTM's in a month when he comes to a final decision on all the new rules/format etc., and no longer accepts games played with patches prior to v1.29f.</div></div><hr />
