<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2003, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Greetings fellow citizens. Welcome to the official Term 3 campaign thread for the Executive. <br />
This thread is an opportunity for the people seeking election to any of the following positions to state their case:<br />
President<br />
Domestic Leader<br />
Military Leader<br />
Foreign Affairs Leader<br />
Culture Leader<br />
Trade Leader <br />
Science Leader.<br />
<br />
It is also an opportunity for you the citizens to ask them questions and in general make them work hard for your vote.  <br />
<br />
The election office has a number of questions it would like the candidates to answer in order to help the citizens decide who is the most worthy.<br />
<br />
<br />
1).Why are you standing for this position?<br />
2).Why are you standing for other positions too?<br />
3).What are your objectives for the first 7 days of office?<br />
4).What qualities can you bring to this position that your fellow candidates cant?<br />
5).How will you get more people involved in the game?<br />
6).If you have held office before, what was your greatest triumph and worst disaster?<br />
7).Which method of victory do you want to pursue and why?<br />
8). How have you contributed to this game?<br />
<br />
Please take the time to answer these questions and have fun debating. :)</div></div><hr />

The debate went very well, and they were very productive, answering the debate questions below as well as several added by Peri and by the audience.  Our main difference of opinion was the role of the Judiciary in making laws; Peri believes that the Judicial members should not create laws for approval and that this is unethical, while I believe that the Judiciary should play an active role in lawmaking and should write and pass laws constitutionally.  Here is the unedited log of our debate:<br />

It's attached in the next post...uploading isnt working for me right now for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, since I wasn't able to attend (and didn't know it was going on anyway), here is a followup question.<br />
<br />
@boots<br />
<br />
If a member of the judiciary proposes a law, and then there is a legal question about the new proposed law or the procedure used to propose or approve it, how should the leader handle that situation?<br />
<br />
@peri<br />
<br />
Your opinion seems to stray away from the principle that all leaders have dual roles, as leader and citizen (and therefor member of congress).  The concept that the judiciary should not legislate is quite valid in RL where there are sufficient people to write laws, but we don't have a separate lawmakeing body.  Do you see any alternatives which would still allow the most qualified individuals to write laws, but avoid ethical entanglements?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 28, 2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@d8575 - The leader should look at the procedure or text of their proposed law objectively and issue a ruling that is as impartial as possible despite the fact that they proposed the law.  They also need to review the constitution fully to be sure that what they are proposing is not unconstitutional or uses unconstitutional means to be passed before they propose it, to prevent that situation from occurring.</div></div><hr />
