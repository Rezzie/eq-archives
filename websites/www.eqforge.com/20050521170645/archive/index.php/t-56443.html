<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2003, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the wake of Chieftess' departure, we have a position open in the Domestic Office.  I currently have a PM out to the Domestic Deputy, Almightyjosh, but he has yet to respond.<br />
<br />
That said, I believe we need to start a nomination process on this one.  Please select a citizen that you think would be the best candidate for this position.<br />
<br />
Just so you know, if AJ responds and accepts this position by June 22nd, I will still hand him the keys to the office.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 02:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am sure Donsig would agree with me if I politely waved Article D under your nose. Based on our previous findings, AJ should assume the position of Domestic Leader and the candidate who polled 3rd should assume the position of deputy.<br />
<br />
Regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 04:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is true, but I have not head from AJ for five days.  That's why I will give him until the 22nd to claim the office.  However, after the seventh day with no contact, I would like to have the tools in place to elect a successor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 05:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Using the law of precedent, Fionn is next in line through the popular vote. Also the new elections will be soon so I am sure Domestic can soldier on until the new term. :)<br />
<br />
Regarding 'tools in place' There is no precedent for the removal of an official by the President nor is there any provision under the Constitution. Perhaps you might request a ruling from the Bench on this or suggest an ammendment giving the President removal and appointment rights in certain circumstances.  As JA I can only offer you interpretations on the Constitution and previous Judicial Rulings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wholeheartedly agree with Peri.  Since Chieftess has resigned, AlmightyJosh is the Domestic Leader and Fionn is the Deputy Domestic Leader.  AJ does not have to claim the office - it is his.  If AJ is not around to run the domestic department then the deputy should step up and run things until such time as AJ returns.<br />
<br />
This is an interesting situation in that there is a fourth candidate from that election, Naervod.  While we have no formal or informal chain of command within our departments it is reasonable, given recent judicial findings, to institute such a CoC for each department.  Not only would this idea give us even more back-up than just having deputies, it may well encourage more citizens to run in our elections since merely running for office would actually make one part of the department's CoC.  This is an idea that I think is well worth exploring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with that. However I believe that there should be a cut off point. Perhaps the first 3 candidates in each poll takes office for the Executive and  the first 2 for the Legislature. Perhaps if the basics of the idea are well received someone could propose this as an ammendment.<br />
<br />
Also in an unrelated matter there should be some limit to the number a positions for which a candidate can seek election in each cycle. Also should people be restricted to seeking election in only one Branch of Government? For example someone could theoretically hold office in all branches which might present a conflict of interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, this should be closed as AJ is Domestic Leader.  Peri, I don't really like the idea of limitations on number of positions run for in each election cycle.  I think we should have as much electoral freedom as we have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">However there is noting to stop someone running for all positions which I am sure you will agree takes some of the uncertainty out of electioneering. people should be elected because they are the best for the job and not because they played the odds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If someone ran for all positions, I doubt they'd get elected to any of them because it would look ridiculous to the voters.  I do see what you mean but I like electoral freedom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Almightyjosh</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Firstly, I must wholeheartedly apologise for my absence over the last 5 days.  For the first day I was in exam mode, then when I came to log on what became the second day of my absence I found that the internet was a no-show.  Eventually Tel-evil-stra (my internet provider) mailed me a letter saying a cable had been cut by a drain-clearing crew in my street.  How you cut a cable by clearing a drain is beyond me, in fact, I actually thought the cable was above ground.  Anyway, I am back now and ready to assume the role of Domestic leader.  (OK, now I gotta go work out what I'm supposed to be doing...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 23, 2003, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it is time to close and unsticky this thread, given that the new domestic leader (AJ) is already decided.</div></div><hr />
