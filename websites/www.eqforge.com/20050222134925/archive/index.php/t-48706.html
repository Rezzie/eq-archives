anyway, vote on what Wonder you think we should pursue first.  Note this will NOT supercede our research goals voting.</div></div><hr />

If we can manage to get the HG in our SSC it would be nice since it would help ensure it stayed at maximum science potential, but it isn't really nessecary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Next in line would be one of two choices...either Colossus for an SSC (if we find a good site), or MPE to start encouraging our neighbors to do our bidding.</div></div><hr />

This may be because I'm a wimpy Warlord and never played Deity but I voted Pyramids. On Warlord they just rock! HG at a close second. :) you're right, it's because you're a wimpy Warlord and never played on Deity ;) (just a friendly jab-no offense intended :) ) Unhappiness problems are such that the Pyramids on Deity can actually be more of a problem then a help as you're scrambling to keep all the extra people happy.  Controlled growth is the key at Deity.  I agree at lower levels Pyramids become more important.  This is what makes this demo games so great.  I've learned more for my own playing here than anything else at CFC, including the GOTMs.</div></div><hr />

DEFINITLY YES, it's the same for me !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Mar 26, 2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted for the HG with colossus a close second. Also we need the colossus in an SSC but it doesn't exist yet. Following this we should head for MP so we can talk to the other civs, exchange techs, swap maps, and have fun demanding tribute.<br />
<br />
I agree that the pyramids suck on deity level. The GW is too expensive to be worth the cost, the lighthouse is rarely necessary unless the geography is weird (can be nice when you can build ironclads though) and the oracle expires too early.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe the way to get HG is the following:<br />
1. Establish the SSC, build one Warrior or IPRB=10 Phx<br />
 &amp;nbsp; (River Plains Delta is my choice, S of Mtn)<br />
2. Then start a wonder<br />
3. Science to Trade first, then Pottery.<br />
4. Feed needed police to SSC from nearby city.<br />
<br />
With Republic Celebrations, we will never miss the Pyramids.<br />
We may discover we want the Lighthouse next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2003, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having loaded the game finally, I'd say MPE should definitely the next priority after the Gardens, then it is close between Colossus and, as GN suggested, lighthouse after that.  Colossus is obvioiusly very nice for the SSC, but if we don't get it, the colossus city can often be a good trade destination - (of course we'll need mpe to find it and lighthouse to get there ;) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JAILEM</div><div class="date">Mar 27, 2003, 01:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hanging Gardens 1st!  <br />
Keep the population happy and producing!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's been my experience that AI civs usually start building the Colossus before the Hanging Gardens; not always, but usually.<br />
Therefore, my recommendation is start with Colossus, but switch to HG if another civilization is going to get that built before our civilization does.<br />
<br />
By the way, our we allowed incrementally build units in Demo game?</div></div><hr />
