It's fun to play the barbarians because other civilizations usually want to ally with you, some will even give you money! Checkout this screenshot:<br />

I am going to use the money my allies gave me and bribe a few AI cities. I have four allies. The entire world will be red soon... &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/biggrin.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />

You cannot build anything but legions in your cities, you cannot even build barracks or settlers, so most of your units are not veterans (which can really suck). I found I was able to survive, but not dominate. It's wierd that they would be so friendly with you in civ2. Perhaps it's because they are unable to measure your diplomacy and military power because those values are not stored for the barbarians, so they are assuming that you are all powerful and very nice.<br />

<br />
another weird thing is that barbarians cannot see as far as non-barbarian units, and they can only use simplified combats. It's going to be very hard to put the world under barbarians' control. I will need at least 50+ archers or knights. &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif&quot; border=0&gt; The good thing is that a few barbarian units pop up from no where once in  a while, and I can control them... pretty neat huh?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Feb 22, 2001, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've tried this as well once, but notice that you &lt;u&gt;always&lt;/u&gt; loose, unless your target is olmost destroyed. Even when you creat a veteran armor and attack a warrior. It looks like it doesn't matter what type of unit you use. You don't just need 50 archers, you also need 50 armors. That's not how it is when an AI controls the barbs.<br />

no, I don't think so.  It looks like all techs acquired by barbarians are not retained.</div></div><hr />

Did you give yourself one settler to start, or did you just take over an enemy city? I've always wondered why barbarians lose so often. I've seen phalanxes defend against 4 dragoons and still have almost full health.</div></div><hr />
