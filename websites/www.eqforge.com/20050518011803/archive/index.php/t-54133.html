In the last turn chat we were unsure where the settler produced during the chat should go.  I think it's time to update the map found in the &quot;filling the continent&quot; thread with the land to the E of Noshuret, and create a definitive priority order of settlement, at least a turnchat in advance for the settlers to be produced that day.  This list should be driven by a combination of production needs and strategic goals.<br />
<br />
How about starting with a strategy question.  Settling the coastal cities first would help us see if any overseas rivals arrive, and it will hold down the seafaring barb risk if the barbs aren't really sedentary.  Another strategy is building toward the opponents first and then filling in the area we control.  A third strategy is taking the best available land.  And we can't forget grabbing resources to maybe deny opponents.<br />
<br />
The selection of settlement strategy affects the build queues as well, unless we don't care about settlers walking all the way across our territory before reaching their destinations.<br />
<br />
Let's start by discussing these options.<br />
<br />
[list=a]<br />
 Grab resources<br />
 Build Toward Opponents<br />
 Build on coast<br />
 Build on best land available<br />
 Other<br />
[/list=a] <br />
<br />
Following that discussion we can determine which order to choose locations to best implement the chosen strategy.</div></div><hr />

Next is setting up a decent buffer between our enemies and our core cities and then we can start getting that good land and coastal cities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 24, 2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The general concensus (sp) lately has been to expand east, to get the dyes and block Egypt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">May 24, 2003, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We need to go east as fast as possible. I say no more settling westwards untill we filled up all the tiles we can eastwards. Westwards is secure. Nobodys going there unless we let them..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">May 24, 2003, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, expanding to the East is my preference too, just wanted to introduce the options and see if there is any dissent.  ;)<br />
<br />
Also this thread was meant to point out that if the general axis of settlement is to the East, we'll settle faster if the build queues are set up to produce settlers in the Eastern cities (Penguinadua for example).  I'd like to prompt an interlock between the expansion strategy, the build queues, and the tile improvements.<br />
<br />
@Chieftess: Do you have a map of tentative city locations to the East of Noshuret?  The settler for the dye city is already on the way, Is it worthwhile to decide where the next one will go?<br />
<br />
@all Thanks for your responses.  :)</div></div><hr />

That would be the best..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 26, 2003, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The idea of a settler factory, is to use your capital, and/or a city close to it at the START OF THE GAME, not 100 turns into it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 04:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regardless of the terminology, one or more cities that are producing settlers are needed right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 04:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i would even say: as we need to rapidly expand towards our enemies AND have to secure a big chunk of land before people can travel by ship around our lands to go there, we need more than one city to produce settlers.</div></div><hr />
