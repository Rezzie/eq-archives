<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 05, 2003, 09:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main focus is on expanding by building lots of engineers. The terrain improvement and expansion plan calls for 5 new cities in both Jayneland and Barbaria. Also it is assumed that we will cpature Berlin, therefore BBF's build queue includes barracks and cavalry.<br />
<br />
&quot;RB&quot; means that the item in question should be finished as quickly as possible. Due to the current emphasis on science this must be done sparingly but we have lots of cash, are getting a caravan delivery bonus soon and will be getting some $$ from taxes for one or two more turns so some rush buying can take place. Since there are lots of RB's the priority should be on cities with long build queues (FJ and BBF), we should found the new cities ASAP.<br />
<br />
Always vote for 0. It makes it easy to see if a particular build queue has majority support. For example, if 0 gets 5 votes and build queue 7 (Superstorms) only 2 it means the build queue does not have majority support and should be changed. If you do not vote for something please indicate how the build queue in question should be changed.</div></div><hr />
