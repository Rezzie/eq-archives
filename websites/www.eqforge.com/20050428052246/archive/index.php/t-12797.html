I read somewhere that it is 100,000 culture points. Is this so? I am asking because I currently have over 100,000 points and the game is going on as usual...<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Does anyone else have problems with the game crashing? I have reached 1974 and every time I hit enter for the end of turn ---&gt; *BOOM* ---&gt; &quot;Invalid Page Fault!&quot; @#$!<br />
I tried everything I could think of. Restarting, defragmenting, going back a couple of years and starting over... *CABOOM* *CABOOM* *CABOOM*<br />
This is so frustrating, especially after all the hours I put in. Any ideas guys?</div></div><hr />

Cultural Victory<br />
Make one of your cities or your shole civilization the envy of all man- and woman-kind (What a feminist. :p). A city with a Cultural value of 20,000 or your civilization is worth 100,000 and at least twice as much as any rival, you win.<br />
<br />
And about that crashing: do you have the patch installed? It might help. Otherwise I can't help you. I'm running under Windows XP, which doesn't crash, but I've also never had any trouble with the game itself; with or without patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nantonio</div><div class="date">Dec 24, 2001, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm running Win98 with the patch.<br />
<br />
The game has actually crashed before. In one game I got a &quot;cities file error&quot; and all the cities dissapeared from the map. In this game, I could only see the English and the French in the Foreign Advisor screen and I had to use the Trade Advisor screen to talk to the other civs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is my last hope. If I can e-mail the saved game to you (Matrix), then just press enter so that the turn ends, save it in the next turn and e-mail it back to me. I know it's a hassle and if you don't want to do it that's cool.<br />
<br />
I probably should upgrade to Win2000 or XP...<br />
<br />
If nothing works, I'll just send you the game as it is and accept the current score I guess. Just as I was picking up speed for the big finale...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Dec 24, 2001, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, no problem. Just email it to me (matrix@civfanatics.net), or upload it in this thread. Make sure you do that before or during Christmas. I'm away a couple of days after that.</div></div><hr />

I have never had the game crash on my operating system,  &quot;WME&quot;:goodjob:</div></div><hr />
