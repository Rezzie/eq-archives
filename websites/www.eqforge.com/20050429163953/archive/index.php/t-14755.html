Please, I'm having my best GOTM and would hate not to finish.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirPleb</div><div class="date">Jan 20, 2002, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think I've found a way around it. In Chartres, before ending this turn, take all the workers off the land and make them all entertainers.  That did it, let the turn finish without crashing for me.<br />
<br />
It looks like the same darn bug. More severe than ever though, probably because of the (painful) loss of JS Bach's in the same turn as the deepening unhappiness. Looks like you'll get JS Bach's back quickly though! :)<br />
<br />
It was just a (very!) lucky guess, I saw Chartres as the last city which was unhappy in one of the variations I tried, so I tried making everyone there happy...<br />
<br />
Good luck denyd. I hope that does it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">denyd</div><div class="date">Jan 20, 2002, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That worked, thanks!!!<br />
<br />
I hope there's another patch soon to correct this annoying bug.<br />
<br />
Thanks again SirPleb:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
in order to get thru this i just made entertainers in those cities so they wouldn't fall into disorder - this worked each time, and it's less costly than the anarchy method</div></div><hr />
