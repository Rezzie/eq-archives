Berlin Barbfarm: IRB engineer now and use it to construct railroad east towards Eburacum and Berlin. Then build bank, SE, SM and then more engineers.<br />
Berlin: Switch to temple, want the city to be of size 3 when we start celebrating. Then MP and then engineer once the city is of size 4+.<br />
Zion: IRB fanatics now, then harbor, temple. Maybe a ship (galleon) to explore the islands to the west ? Maybe engineer to found city somewhere ?<br />
Eburacum: IRB alpine troops now, then harbor, temple. Mine coal ASAP.<br />
<br />
Not much happening here. The BBF stuff should be rushed so BBF can celebrate. Cities should be founded in the north per the terrain improvement and expansion plan.</div></div><hr />

I dont agree, we can make a ton of money by sending silk and spice to Indians. Switch to vans and rush them first, trade is also good for celebrations.<br />

We might want to rush a Silk caravan to send to indians, then rush granery and market. Aftyer that we should considder a wall and baracks.<br />

Build a granary before the harbour to speed up growth.<br />
