<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zwelgje</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently installed a firewall and for some reason when I'm connected to the internet there are popups telling me that someone sends me a packet or requests an echo (or something like that) so my question is:<br />
Is that somebody trying to hack my computer or is that somebody that tries to contact me through Trillian?<br />
<br />
To be safe until now I have always denied contact. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Continue denying! :lol:<br />
<br />
Echo request are used from a network to see whether there is a computer at your network address. Hackers can use this to find victims.<br />
For your own security, your computer should not only not be accessable but not even visible within a network. This will ensure maximum security. :yeah:<br />
<br />
Echo requests are usually made by automated programs which then generate a list of known computers in a net.<br />
<br />
Echo requests by certain programs like Trillian, specifically want to access that program in your computer, they operate only on the ports used by that program. So once the firewall is initialized and told to allow connection to certain programs (browsers, ftp-clients, IM), every other incoming request is either spam or the first step towards a hacking attempt. :eek:<br />
<br />
So continue denying or make a global deny if it´s to much, but make sure to exclude requests to certain programs. Your firewall should tell you where the request is directed at.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent  explanation and discussion, Lucky!  I hope a lot of people notice what you are saying....  many people are very niave about what is really going on &quot;out there&quot;, and their machines and files are an open book.<br />
<br />
If a person is using DSL/Cable, etc. with a static IP, or a dynamic IP that changes only every few days or weeks, then you should NOT be on the internet without a good firewall program like BlackICE Defender (my choice), or maybe Zone Alarm, or maybe others can recommend what they use.<br />
<br />
If you are dial up, you are relatively safe, because most dial up assigns a new IP each time you connect, and the huge hacker databases that are constructed will not likely contain your machine's actual IP at a later date, when the hacker takes a look at the automated output and decides to attack your machine (you will very likely be at a different IP by then).<br />
<br />
USE A PERSONAL FIREWALL!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceBlaZe</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 05:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Tiny Personal Firewall 2.0 <br />
<br />
Some hacker that used to be on the l0pht heavy industries team recommended me it, is it any good?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use Tiny Personal Firewall, too, it´s absolutely great and &quot;survived&quot; any tests available on the net without compromising my comp. :yeah:<br />
<br />
I even made some hacking attempts myself, from another comp, with knowledge of the software and my system and so most security measures. Not a chance! :lol:<br />
<br />
It´s probably the best you can get for free, at least IMHO.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceBlaZe</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 12:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually bought it. I used it and liked it a lot, so I gave Tiny Software some credit and payed $40 for a true license.<br />
But now this license is worthless when 3 is out and that version actually COSTS money. So I paid for a free version, leaving no money for the paid version. :D</div></div><hr />
