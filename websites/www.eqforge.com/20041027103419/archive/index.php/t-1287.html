--------------------------------------<br />
<br />
However, what I am doing is introducing what I have seen so far...as far as Star Trek is concerned. I have to tell everyone that I have played a lot of Star Trek scenarios (probably all of them) and I know that good scenarios are in short supply. This isn't because there are a whole lot of them and authors fail to make them good, it's mostly because there are really only a few out there. I have 32 on my harddrive and three of those are actually modpacks (7 are included in Kevin Gilbert's Trek Mod,two mods of which I have authored, 1 mod in production and 4 scenarios in production).<br />
<br />
I have started to playtest Kobayashi's STAR TREK: DOMINION WARS. I'm on Day 32, second chapter and &quot;it is the best Star Trek scenario I have ever played.&quot; So far, I've played this scenario with very critical eyes, and by now in any other scenario, I would have easily pointed out at least 10 or more things that I would improve. So far, I count 0. Generally, I wouldn't even mention anything about a scenario until I've finished playing it...but Kobayashi has done excellent work to this point...I see no reason for it to change. I'm playing it cold, without reading the strategy guide, and at the author's request, I've refrained from viewing all files and materials until finishing the scenario (which is quite challenging at the moment and I am giving the Dominion hell like you wouldn't believe)<br />
<br />
Basically, I am telling you this because when it is released, I strongly encourage everyone to download this scenario because I am having a great time playing it. It's certainly not just for Trekkers, and that is a major requirement of mine...at the same time, it works well for any ST fan. <br />
<br />
Consider this, a preliminary report...one that you can expect me to follow up on.<br />
<br />
JV out.<br />

I would like to know what level you are playing too. If its at Commodore level or higher, HELL won't even be approaching for another 100 days. He He He.  Poor Alcibiaties was playing the earlier versions before it was toned down-he can tell you all about it (but after you have finished of course).<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from you again in a while about your progress.<br />

<br />
I have submitted it to S-League and it should appear in a while on the review list there. If you can't wait, just give me an e-mail address which can handle 2 Megs and I will send it to you.<br />
<br />
Dear Everyone else,<br />
<br />
The release version does not have the strategy guide. Polaris has kindly agreed to post it at the Art of War site after he has finished with the scenario himself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Part of my strategy was to get as much gold as possible to buy units at the beginning. But somewhere between managing between gold and science...I ended up getting the Battleship tech, which turned my game around and helped me trememdously. <br />
<br />
Gotta catch the bus now...more later!<br />

<br />
Are you playing as the Federation? Is that the Dominion Battleship tech? If it is, you found a bug we didn't. You should ONLY be albe to build federation designs.<br />

John finished his game on day 87. He has done the impossible. I have cc our email correspondence to you. We have to discover how he got the Bship tech (not on this fourm of course).</div></div><hr />

<br />
All is fine and dandy. The cause of the Bship 'bug' has been isolated. Its a long story but in summary, it has to do with playing a saved game from FW on MGE or vice versa - so I doubt that it will ever recurr. But for those of you fanatics out there like me who have both FW and MGE installed on the same PC, do take note.<br />
<br />
We are still waiting for S-League to post the files on its review list. Or maybe it can make its first official appearance on civfantics, let me check with john and thunderfall.</div></div><hr />

I must take a moment now to recommend this scenario to everyone. It is fun as heck to play and I am preparing the review for it.<br />
Download it as soon as it's posted.  <br />
<br />
It was just uploaded to TF, who has probably been overwhelmed with files at the moment...<br />
<br />
(let's just say I don't envy his email account)<br />

This was the most fun I've had with a play test in a long time...<br />
