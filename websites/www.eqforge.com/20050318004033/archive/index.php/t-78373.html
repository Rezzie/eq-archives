<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boyd</div><div class="date">Feb 11, 2004, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Middle Ages<br />
<br />
With the entry into the Middle Ages the Indian begin to glimpse the great future that may unfold for them if they would sit still and listen to the wind. A Golden Age awaits, however, the threat from the south still looms and contacts over the water have been made (see previous spoiler for dates) – Rome and Carthage are willing to trade and we enjoy good relations although a Roman town to the NW beside the strange grey beasts that grow ivory causes some concern.<br />
<br />
Our Iron supply is connected in 260AD and the following decade sees the people of Sidon (W of Madras and S of Bombay) cast off their oppressors and join the Indian Empire… Much joy and jubilation is heard in the streets.<br />
<br />
Brave sailors decide to find rumoured peoples elsewhere and in 330AD a galley sets off into the east but is heard from no more… <br />
<br />
Heady discussions with Sidon coffee results in talk of a new form of governing and it is with great joy and jubilation that the Indian people embrace Monarchy in 350.<br />
<br />
Such is the happiness of the people that they toil mightily in Delhi to begin the Hanging Gardens in 360 (15 turns).<br />
<br />
In 460 a galley leaves the Roman coast behind and sets off to follow the sun and it too is heard from no more…<br />
<br />
Strife breaks out between our neighbours as neoCarthage declares war on Rome but my people are contemplating the beauty of the Hanging Gardens (500AD).<br />
<br />
Surely it is the beauty of Delhi and the contemplative life that encourages the citizens of Pisae to place their governor in the stocks, raid the armoury and bring their lands to my throne in 580AD. It is this unity of our peoples that begins to solve the riddle of the great grey beasts. The people of the NW suggest that the beasts can be tamed as beasts of toil and possibly… no, that is too absurd.<br />
<br />
The First Roman War (600 - 1070)<br />
<br />
In 600 Feudalism is discovered and in 620AD Chivalry is discovered. The absurd idea is put to the test and War Elephant production begins. In that decade we join neoCarthage in an alliance against Rome.<br />
<br />
Preparations begin as Delhi trains up the 1st War Elephant and another gallant galley heads into the West and again, it is presumed lost. Engineering (700) and Theology (740) are discovered and Delhi begins the Sistine Chapel.<br />
<br />
In 760AD our first expeditionary force lands in Roman lands with the objective of liberating Leptis Minor from the Roman tyranny. Through the judicious use of Persian Mercenaries our glorious armies liberate Leptis Minor in 800 (walls are rushed). Nothing further happens in this theatre until peace is signed in 1070AD.<br />
<br />
The Second Persian War (810 - 1020)<br />
<br />
To the south, Persian trespassing enflames the passions of my people. Nine War Elephants and Persian Mercenaries assemble in Sidon. War is declared in 810AD	and War elephants clear the Persian border guards and India enters a Golden Age! Indian forces swarm towards Pasgardae. Sistine Chapel in 13 turns (+125gpt)!<br />
<br />
Invention (820) is discovered and a Temple is rushed in Leptis Minor for 116gp.<br />
<br />
Persian counter attacks on Sidon fail (850) but losses outside of Pasagardae result in the attack being put on hold. Persian naval victories begin to cause concern. A lone galley sails into the east from southern Persia and spots a pinkish border. Contact cannot yet be made.<br />
<br />
A brave galley finally makes contact with Nidaros (860) and immediately an Embassy is established… (India:705; Persia: 531; neoCarthage: 448; Rome: 419; Vikings: 360).<br />
<br />
In 870 Pasargadae falls! We control sun Tzu’s Art of War. In 910 Gunpowder is discovered. Tarsus falls and the Great Leader Chandragupta, leader of elephants, arises from the dust of the battle! Tarsus is renamed by Chandragupta’s troops in his honour. Great debate rages in the throne room - rush Sistine Chapel with three turns left or build an Army? A War Elephant Army is formed in the newly christened (oops) city of Chandragupta.<br />
<br />
Embassies are established immediately upon contact with Greece and Germany.<br />
<br />
930AD… A bitter sweet year. Chandragupta and his War Elephants take Arbela and Persia’s sole source of Iron but Greece finishes Sistine Chapel beating Delhi by one turn! No other advances or wonders are available except for Heroic Epic at a loss of 385 shields.<br />
<br />
In 950AD an Embassy established in Bursa… the lone island city of the Ottomans! (India: 746; Persia: 541; Germany: 538; Greece: 520; neoCarthage: 457; Rome: 431; Vikings: 371; Ottomans: 268).<br />
<br />
With the discovery of Education in 960 rendering the Great Library obsolete, the unfortunate team of alchemists all suddenly experienced a fatal lab explosion. Chemistry in 11 with +25gpt.<br />
Persopolis attacked! But the inexhaustible supply of pikemen results in a draw with a redlined veteran pikemen holding out.<br />
<br />
In 970AD Chandragupta reenters the fray but War elephants are pulled back to refit. But Pasagardae switches allegiance (990) and war weary War Elephants retake the city… if it did not house Sun Tzu’s it would have been raised! Chemistry is discovered.<br />
<br />
1010AD	Golden Age ends (culture at 9 300+).<br />
<br />
The entire Persian army must be in Persopolis and elephants crash fruitlessly against its walls Peace is signed with Persia (1020) while the printing press is discovered… rejoicing in the streets! <br />
<br />
Republican Commerce (1060 - 1390)<br />
<br />
However, the rejoicing results in a loosing of morals and a Republic is declared (1060).<br />
<br />
The advent of Republicanism ideals results in a realisation of the power of trade. Babylon contacts us and trades contact with the Keltoi and 19 gp for neoCarthage (1080). The following decade we trade everybody for all of their dosh for almost every contact and trade printing press to Germany for 18gpt.<br />
<br />
Music theory in 6 turns (1100) and in 1130 we trade chemistry to Greece for 66gp &amp; 36gpt but they won’t trade astronomy except for over 1800 gp. Music theory discovered… Astronomy in 5 turns… Bombay switches from Palace to JS Bach’s (1160). In 1190AD we trade 890gp for Banking with Babylon. Germany builds JS Bach’s (1200); Bombay switches to Palace. Astronomy discovered in 1210… Democracy in 7 turns… Bombay switches to Copernicus’.<br />
<br />
Second Roman War (1255 - 1400)<br />
<br />
In 1255 Rome trespasses and declares war. neoCarthage joins us in alliance against Rome for Chemistry. <br />
<br />
Democracy discovered 1260… research Free Artistry in 5 turns.	Persopolis beats us to Copernicus’ by one turn 1280 and Bombay switches to Palace, again. A Roman Army is destroyed outside of Rome.<br />
<br />
Physics in 8 turns… Bombay switches to Shakespeare’s at the cost of 43 shields (1285).<br />
	<br />
In 1300AD our armies sever Rome’s iron supply and Bombay begins building Magellan’s voyage.<br />
<br />
With the discovery of Physics we sell it to everybody:<br />
- to Greece for a RoP, incense, world map, 65gp &amp; 87gpt<br />
- to Babylon for 167gp &amp; world map<br />
- to Germany for world map, 94gp &amp; 33gpt<br />
- to Keltoi for world map, silks, 52gp &amp; 21gpt<br />
- to Vikings for world map, 31gp &amp; 4gpt (they are at war with the Keltoi)<br />
- to Persia for world map, 105gp &amp; 29gpt<br />
- to neoCarthage for 102gp &amp; 4gpt<br />
Gift education to Ottomans whereupon Sulyeman exclaims: “How did you know it was my birthday?” I guess we have the same day (February 3rd)…<br />
Total trades: Cash: 4 176 (616gp &amp; 178gpt), incense, silks and more world maps then I need!<br />
Science up to 60%… ToG in 5 turns followed by metallurgy in 4 turns. Bombay switches to Newton’s in 8 turns.<br />
<br />
In 1360AD Rome falls and Shivaji arises as the Great Leader of this tremendous victory. Shivaji departs for Delhi after his troops rename Rome in his honour! This will also provide us with our own fur supply and enough for trading to others.<br />
<br />
Pompeii falls in 1370AD. Military Tradition in 4 turns.<br />
<br />
In 1375AD Shivaji arrives in Delhi and fortifies… Bombay will finish Newton’s in two turns and no one else is building it so I will risk it.<br />
<br />
Veii succumbs to the might of India’s elephants despite the use of muskets (1380) and <br />
Germany demands saltpetre only to depart with their tail between their legs.<br />
<br />
Newton’s University is built in1385AD! Does Bombay use Shivaji for Magellan’s or do we wait? Wait it is… maybe we can trade for Smith’s. ToG will be the tool:<br />
- to Babylon for 84gp, 33gpt &amp; Economics<br />
- to Greece for 124gp &amp; 21gpt<br />
- to neoCarthage for 157 &amp; 45gpt<br />
- to Persia for 31gp &amp; 11gpt<br />
Total: 2 596 (396 + 2 200), Economics and a sack full of maps<br />
Rush Smith’s in Bombay. <br />
<br />
Magnetism in six and we revolt to Democracy (1390). Antium and Neapolis fall… mass upgrades to Cavalry.<br />
<br />
In 1395AD while the cavalry watch, War elephants sortie against the last Roman town: Cumae. Although cumae holds out with a longbowman, Porus arises from the dust of the battle and after leaving instructions to bring up the last of the War Elephants, departs for India.<br />
Give the Vikings metallurgy (11gp) to assist in their struggle against the annoying Germans.<br />
<br />
Cumae falls and is renamed Porus by the troops (1400). With Rome’s demise India enters the Industrial Age! Porus enters Delhi to waves of jubilation (1410).<br />
<br />
India: 1058; Germany: 791; Greece: 639; Persia: 564; neoCarthage: 520; Rome: 479; Keltoi: 457; Vikings: 454; Babylon: 395; Ottomans: 222<br />
<br />
In summary, we have a weakened and tame Persia and we are using trades of technologies to bankrupt all the other Civs while ensuring we have enough  gp to fund our own research. I have never played a trading game before and it was quite fun.</div></div><hr />

Ancient Age report (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=1581447#post1581447) <br />
<br />
Middle Age<br />
<br />
As we entered the middle age (210AD), we were at war against the Persians, and a score of our valiant archers were on their way with the mission of beginning the end of the once proud Persian empire.<br />
<br />
This proved very difficult though, since Persian cities were defended by pikemen. Indeed Persians beat us to Feudalism. Our strategists had to reevaluate the campaign, and it is only in 720AD that a modest force of 10 war elephants took Persepolis, forcing Xerxes to abandon his luxurious palace. The Indian people rejoiced, and it was the beginning of a golden age for India. The success was then crowned by the rise of Great Leader amongst our troops in 740AD, who took the lead of a mighty army of war elephants.<br />
In 1080AD, the Persians were no more, and we set our sights on another continent; it was time to pay the Carthagenians a visit...<br />
<br />
The Carthagenian war started in 1340AD by taking the first city, which had just completed Bach's. The war was swift, and it ended in 1550AD with the end of the Carthagenians, on a small island south. As we were regrouping and making ready to attack the Romans, we entered the Industrial Age, in 1565AD. We had just started to build a Forbidden Palace in Theveste.<br />
<br />
Even though we have built the heroic epic long ago, no more Great Leaders have risen. We are still in Monarchy, since we like to rule with an iron hand, especially in times of war.<br />
<br />
We practically do not research during the Middle Age, instead we trade a lot. Towards the end of the age though, we start researching more actively.<br />
<br />
What I found most dificult regarding lack of ressources, is to have to defend my continent only with Spearmen during the Middle Age. Luckily, an iron ressource appeared close to my capital, but I was about to capture that of the Persians at that time. I found out later the likelyhood of this to happen was higher than usual, due to the high number of ressources on the map.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">test_specimen</div><div class="date">Feb 11, 2004, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the beginning of the Middle Ages I produced mostly War Elephants and took some more of the Persian Cities. However I failed to keep up a decisive force and ran out of WE. After the upgrade to cavalry and losing some more I gave up attacking further and left the Persians some cities near the southern coast.  My reputation was never good with the other nations.<br />
<br />
Celts had taken the island to the east, while Carthage and Rome shared the island to the west. Babylon had basically the large continent, Scandinavia was reduced to a small island.<br />
<br />
I had the tech lead at the end of the age, but had to stay in Republic, due to my bad reputation and constant wars. (else I would have changed to Democracy).<br />
<br />
Mistakes made in this age: not decisive enough against the Persians. Did nothing to improve reputation and made some bad tech and trading decisions. Did nothing to stop the Babylonians.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Megalou</div><div class="date">Feb 11, 2004, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Predator PTW1.27<br />
<br />
Progress<br />
<br />
Entered MA as a republic in 310 BC with all contacts except Celts and Scandinavia, learning all first level techs in the same turn thanks to The Republic. So I started researching chivalry. The middle ages always seems to be the slowest era for me (although I have never actually counted the turns) so I was looking forward to a Golden Age, as well as the aquisition of the still Persian territory. So even though chivalry is not a required tech and I am going for early space race victory, it seemed like the natural choice.<br />
<br />
I did know a little bit about Celts and Scandinavia before I met them, because I had spotted some unknown border colours next to the Babylonian capital. There was suddenly a change from pink to dark green, proving with 99.9% certainty that they were at war. (It could hardly have been a flip because the pink borders had been expanded.) That meant that they were both almost certainly behind in tech.<br />
<br />
In terms of peaceloving you can see that I fit in the hypocritical category. I gathered 7-8 elephants and some longbows and took the two northernmost Persian cities, including 2 lambs, with ease.<br />
<br />
The mess starts<br />
<br />
When I took the 2nd town, the lamb town, I really caught Persia off guard. They had used their medieval radar to send their immortals into the mountains towards one of my unguarded cities (stupidly ignoring the lightly defended town in Mutton Valley).  Because they now turned back to recapture the lamb town, I sued for peace gaining 150 gold. I also took 55 gpt in the peace treaty. Why did the mess start there, you wonder? The reason is that I broke this deal almost right away and later another peace treaty with Persia. I figured that Greece, Babylon, Germany, Ottomans, Celts and Scandinavia would not be able to make contact with Persia, Rome and Carthage before I had wiped all those 3 civs out.<br />
<br />
I therefore researched the bottom half of the tech tree, waiting to trade Education, Astronomy and Banking. But the plan did not succeed. By the time the southerners learned astronomy I had built two towns in between Rome and Carthage (hampered by each other by a long war), but I hadn't gone to work on those two civs yet. My scandalous behavor towards Persia had given me control of the starting continent and I started building courthouses all over former Persia. I didn't have to starve the Persian citizens very much so the towns became productive pretty quickly (although I had one flip in the remainder of the game). I left Persia one town on the island south of Rome/Carthage when I realized that I could not avoid the bad reputation.<br />
<br />
Second core<br />
<br />
I used my first Great Leader, from the Persian Wars, to rush Sistine Chapel in a former Persian city. A town with this wonder expands after just 2 turns so it was a good insurance against a flip.<br />
<br />
My second leader came in the brief war with Carthage (cavalry), and was used to build the Forbidden Palace in the Middle of the Carthage/Rome continent. It took me only two or three turns to take the 5 Carthagenian towns (3 of which were of city-size). Rome took about five or six turns after that. Hardly any starving was necessary and the war weariness in republic was minor. (The Roman war actually took place in the early industrial age but I'm putting it here to make this post a bit more substantial. It doesn't seem like a spoiler to me.) <br />
<br />
That was the end of my military ambitions in this game.<br />
<br />
Reputation<br />
<br />
I didn't find my reputation hit to be a very big problem, although maybe later on the remaining civs declared some more useless wars on me than they would have done otherwise. Later, I often gave away techs for Right of Passage to my potential trading partners and took every chance to trade luxuries and strategic resources. Sistine Chapel was useful since I sometimes got a little low on luxuries. The Greeks got to the wine island before me and they were the ones I hoped to be my best trading partner, so I wasn't going to attack them.<br />
<br />
Techs<br />
<br />
Unfortunately a long war broke out between Ottomans, Greece and Germany (never mind who fought who). This would slow down their tech pace considerably.<br />
<br />
Learning Military Tradition was probably unnecessary, but when I did I still clinged to the hope that I could save my reputation by deferring astronomy. I eventually traded for education, astronomy, banking, economics and navigation with the southerners.<br />
<br />
4 turn research pace was only achieved for Democracy, which many civs already had. Maybe Theory of Gravity was 4 turns too, but I think it was 5.<br />
<br />
Some More Wonders<br />
<br />
I managed to build Copernicus' and Newton's in Delhi. Captured Pyramids and Oracle from Persia. Also built Smith's.<br />
<br />
Transition to the industrial age<br />
<br />
I entered the industrial age in 880 AD. I did have a tech lead, but unfortunately I did not have a monopoly on Democracy to sell so I decided to research Nationalism for the first time in ages, knowing that it has the best trade value when the time comes to gift certain civs into the middle ages. The Roman war was not over either, so the odd riflemen felt like a possible insurance. Still: not good! It was the third optional tech I would research so far (the fourth if you count republic). However, you can be sure I will not research sanitation - this game is so dirty anyway...</div></div><hr />

Ancient Age Spoiler (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=77814&amp;perpage=20&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=1) <br />
<br />
After entering the Middle Ages, a short time passed before I declared war on Persia (290 AD).  I don’t recall if I was still without iron at this point, but a deposit was discovered northwest of Karachi.  Several Persian cities fell to the less equipped but well trained Indian forces.  I did suffer from a couple culture flips, but these were recaptured.  In 350 AD, an elite Indian archer (marking the creation of the “Black Cats,” India’s renowned elite troops) generates India’s first Great Leader (built army).  <br />
<br />
The Great Library continues to provide technologies; my advancement is only as good as the other civs.  <br />
<br />
Heroic Epic &amp; Military Academy enabled following a victory by the Indian army.<br />
<br />
Indian High Command, in spite of appeals for peace by the Xerxes, continues to wage war against Persia.  In 650 AD, a Persian Great Leader is executed in the field.  In 750 AD, the Great Library provides Chivalry, War Elephant production begins.  I consciously choose to avoid trigger my GA.<br />
<br />
Having already established an embassy w/ the Vikings, I notice that their capital has been captured by the Keltoi (760 AD). <br />
<br />
In 850 AD, the Great Library provides several techs, including Education. :(<br />
<br />
In 850 AD – Indians revolt; Indian Republic created in 860 AD.  I begin doing my own research at this point.  India will lead the tech race throughout the remainder of the game (wish we had those SGLs).<br />
<br />
In 880 AD, the capture of Susa fulfills India’s claim of “Manifest Destiny.”  Persia is now attempting an OCC victory.  Surprisingly, Persia is capable of paying 29gpt in the peace settlement.  Also, in this turn, I rush build marketplaces &amp; courthouses in most Indian cities.<br />
<br />
In 970 AD, I gain communications w/ the remaining civs; tech &amp; luxury trades increase.  The full world map is gained in 1110 AD.<br />
<br />
The Forbidden Palace is built in the former Persian capital city of Persepolis.  :)<br />
<br />
Indian surveillance elements begin hearing of wars and rumors of wars.  Rome destroys neoCarthaginians.  <br />
<br />
India enters the Industrial Age first in 1275 AD; enjoying 4 turn research rate w/ sliders at 1 – 8 – 1. <br />
<br />
The decision here is to decide what victory condition to pursue.  Having secured the starting landmass, established a leadership position among the world’s civs through diplomacy, economics, and might, and monopolized the world’s technology race, I decide to focus on a primary victory condition = domination (space race secondary).  Also, I choose not to pursue two front wars; therefore, I risk allowing Rome to solidify its continent while I focus on the Keltoi and their smaller landmass to my east.  The Babylonians, Ottomans, and Greeks ought to keep one another in check until I am logistically capable of bringing them under Indian rule.  Of course, they are useful in marginalizing my civ of choice.  Current world relationships are polite.<br />

Middle Ages 70BC-760AD<br />
<br />
I said in Spoiler 1 that I reached Middle Ages in 110BC or thereabouts. Going over my sketchy notes for this spoiler I now believe it was 70BC.<br />
<br />
Suicide Galleys/Meeting Civs. I lost a few galleys mostly east from North India and all directions from the one tile mountain island south of former Persia. First contact was Carthage in 570BC. I went along the north side of Carthage/Rome Island at first. A galley came zooming out of the fog touching on my west coast at one point. From this I deduced suicide wasn't needed because apparently the AI doesn't do that. And that going west from the spot that galley showed was the closest path to Carthage...and it was.<br />
<br />
By 30AD we knew all except Ottoman and Keltoi. Met the Keltoi last in 300AD. <br />
<br />
Victory Condition. Since we had four scientific civs (after inviting Persia to take a seat), the research-type wins seemed appropriate. 20K cultural probably needs to start immediately...too late for that. With a religious civ 100K cultural could work, but I didn't have nearly enough towns or space. I have played Domination/Conquest exclusively to date...time for something else. Life is too short for Histographic. So we have Space Race or Diplo. I don't have much of a feel for Diplo/AI Attitude/Reputation so Space Race it is.<br />
<br />
Seems like the deal is tech as fast as possible, so that is how we oriented the play.<br />
<br />
Research. After gifting the Scientific civs into MA (they all got Monotheism) I started Engineering for what reason I can't think at this point. One thing...I was expecting the AI to go for Feudalism which never happened. After that mistake I went beeline for Navigation. Then back to Feudalism and the lower track. <br />
<br />
The first tech went in 6 turns I think. As I got better developed this dropped and I noticed that the entire lower track was all 4-turn. This 4-turn research continued until...well, a long time.<br />
<br />
I can't recall a single MA tech being researched by the AI in the MA. I guess smallish continents at Monarch level isn't great for AI research. They did get Monarchy eventually for which I gave an old tech in case I ever needed it for War Weariness.<br />
<br />
I didn't bother with even checking the non-scientific civs...they were so backwards I didn't think they could help. Would be interesting if somebody actually got them to contribute.<br />
<br />
Wars. I was content to sit back and develop towards my Spaceship, but the AI had other plans.<br />
<br />
Carthage-declared out of the blue in 300AD. I was busy building Universities and researching to Navigation and so didn't go get them right away. Didn't get around to Chivalry until 440AD, so Carthage felt the wrath of my Swords at first. After Chivalry I built up to about 16-20 War Elephants at any given time...just slowly wore them down and concentrated on research and infrastructure. This war dragged on past the end of Middle Ages.<br />
<br />
Vikings-landed a warrior and an archer on India in 470AD. Renegotiated Peace and got their gold. Next turn told them to get out and they declared...doesn't the AI look at the Power Graph??!! Blasted everything they landed and gave them peace in a few turns.<br />
<br />
Rome-these guys hit me with a sneak attack in 550AD. I just fought them off in MA. This war lasted into the IA as well. Between Carthage and Rome we saw a lot of Legions.<br />
<br />
War Weariness was no problem in the India Republic apparently because these wars were all started by the AI. Probably Monarch level has something to do with it. I seem to be used to Deity and am continually surprised when things don't go as badly as I expect.<br />
<br />
In 650AD the very first Great Leader appeared. Although I had waited a long time, it showed at a good time...rushed Newton in Persepolis, giving it both Copernicus and Newton for a big boost in research.<br />
<br />
Golden Age. In 510AD I forgot about the GA and swatted a Viking warrior with a new War Elephant. Hadn't wanted to do this since I was at 4-turn research and figured to save the GA until research needed a boost. As well, the bigger you are, the more shields and commerce you get. As it turned out this may have helped the cause in that I finished Universities just about everywhere and ended the GA with 5000+ gold. This gold would fund research until...well, a long time. I didn't need to rush anything to maintain 4-turn.<br />
<br />
In 760AD we researched the last needed MA tech having had absolutely no help from the AI and entered the Industrial Age at war and having a grand ole time.</div></div><hr />

Entering Middle Age<br />
I entered Middle Age around year 0. Don't know exactly since I didn't note it down. Anyway, I entered as last in score, but with the number one city in the world, on a good way to a 20K victory. I still benefitted from the Great Library and only had 10% scientists running. I was in Republic so I could quickly rush the buildings needed once my wonders were built. My galleys, guided by the Great Lighthouse had already established contact with all <br />
civilizations. As can be seen in the below picture, Persia was putting a constant pressure on me, but I was slowly building up an attacking force. In Delhi, an odd 10 archers are hiding under the spearman. I would wait for the mighty Elephants to arrive though until Persia was taught a lesson. Bombay meanwhile completed the Sistine Chapel in 670 AD.<br />
<br />

<br />
The first Counter-attack<br />
Although Bombay was building culture up nicely I felt that I at least needed my part of this island in order to keep up in the tech race. In 770 AD I launched my first counterattack against Persia. When peace was signed in 820AD I had captured 3 of Xerxes northern cities, among them Bangalore. When I declared war however, my reputation took a small hit since my trade route with Rome and Carthage (made possible with the Lighthouse) was blocked by the Persian city Hamadan. In 780 AD The Persians completed Sun Tzu:s in Pasargadae, the Wool City. My Sun Tzu build in Bombay was shifted to Palace prebuild and I would probably end up getting Leos, since Invention was now on the <br />
board (Persia).<br />
<br />
The Sequel Wars<br />
Deciding again that my land area wasn't big enough I decided to start a new war with Persia once the Peace Treaty went out, in which I grabbed Sardis and Tarsus. I also captured Susa but couldn't hold it due to massive counter-attacks. In this first sequel war I also got my first GL from one of my Longbowmen. This GL was used to form an army of War Elephants, since I wanted the Epic and the Academy for my Culture. Bombay completed Leos in 1050 AD. With my new army and a bunch of new War Elephants I gained enough confidence to start a third (decisive as it turned out) war against Xerxes. He was now getting weak on immortals, although I hadn't made a specific effort to take out his iron city. Xerxes was history in 1410 AD and in the battle of his last city, Tyre, I generated my second leader. <br />
<br />
Moving towards Industrial<br />
I used the leader to rush Shakespeares Theatre. Before that I had hand built Copernicus (1250), Bachs (1385) and Newtons (1475) but it seems I will miss out on Smiths and I've already missed Magellans. I have completed the Heroic Epic and Forbidden Palace in Bombay. At about 1500 AD I entered the Industrial Age as tech leader but my score was still very low - around 700, in fact less than the eliminated Persians! :eek: I also switched to Democracy during the Middle Ages to speed up my tech a bit.<br />
<br />
Here is Bombay in 1535 AD (10598 culture points):<br />

I decided to go for Domination. ;) Persians lasted until about 100CE as I was trying to fish for leaders (got two against them). Then I started shipping Medieval Infantry to Carthage to get the Great Lighthouse and horses. That was accomplished before 500CE. Then I got Cavalries and eliminated Romans (they had THREE sources of iron in their little area!).<br />
<br />
I could have researched myself to IA before 700CE, but stopped research after Navigation because it wasn't needed. I didn't have enough ships to ferry all my Cavalries to the main AI lands, I had maybe 40 unused. The Golded Age was triggered with wonders.<br />
<br />
Managed to dominate in 810CE, which was later than I would have liked. The main problem was that it took too long to get horses. There was much time I could not produce units so some usually useless Cathedrals were build (I tried to build ICS style but the result wasn't dense enough, so the Caths helped). On the other hand, I think I now managed to maximize happiness better than ever before (traded for luxuries/used luxury slider aggressively).<br />
<br />
Playtime was under 10h, so a quick game. The beginning was really interesting. I might replay later. Firaxis score 6496.</div></div><hr />

The trick is to fight and still have 4-turn research rate. A good second core is needed ASAP and then depending on the situation, some marketplaces and libraries. Universities should'nt be needed until IA. All the rest is for building units.</div></div><hr />

I would have to say the combination did the trick, although I don't have enough experience to be able to say for sure. I was basically running two cores, original India and Persia, which is supposed to be the best way to maximize research. The former Persian capital was an awesome beaker generator.<br />
<br />
During the war years (most of the time) I built research and needed infrastructure first and then military. The AI wasn't much of a threat and I just got after them as it was convenient.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So far I've played a very defensive game. The lack of iron and horses, meant no quality attackers would be available until Chivalry was available and then going for Theology (Sistine), meant Persia got Feudalism well before I got Chivalry and soon had multiple pikes in every border town. And just as I got Chivalry, they got Gunpowder (as did I via the Great Library) and muskets showed up in their border cities. They must have traded for it, as they had no local source (probably Rome or Carthage). Not wanting to send Elephants versus Muskets and already having a large and expensive (under Republic) military, I kept moving forward on a 20K victory path with Sistine (in 670 AD same as Email10), Copernicus and Newton. Persia got most of the rest of the MA wonders. Persia has attacked once each age so far, and both times I was able to beat back the Teal Hordes in Mutton Valley, using a combination of artillery (catapults first then cannons) and Bows (Archers &amp; LB), with defenders (spears &amp; muskets) easily eliminating whatever survived to reach the city walls of Lahore.<br />
<br />
My dilemma of whether to attack with my superior quality troops in a larger Persian force will be decided during the next spoiler. Until then I’ll just keep defending my borders and adding culture to Bombay (I'll have to check the current culture). I am the tech, culture and population leader so whichever way I go, victory is pretty likely. I’ve met the rest of the world and what’s left of Carthage is being swallowed by Rome, who is the only challenger to Persia &amp; India for the #1 spot. The others trail by 4-5 techs, have little land and few resources.</div></div><hr />

Ancient Age Spoiler (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=1573913#post1573913) <br />
<br />
I entered the MA in 230ad just as I had severed Persia's contact with the iron mines. As predicted, Persia was toast and my archers ran roughshod over the remaining Persian cities. In 550ad Persia was down to just 2 cities along the coast when we allowed Persia to buy a little time in exchange for Monarchy. In celebration of the Indian victory over the Persians, Ghandi was named King of India.<br />
<br />
On entering the MA, we noted that Babylon (the only scientific civ we had met) had gotten Feudalism. I was still using the Great Library for research at this point, but getting to Chivalry fast was my top priority. We decided our best bet was to run for Monotheism (17t - but would drop once we built the FP in Persepolis) and hope another civ researched Feudalism so our GL could take it. Contact with either Greece or the Ottomans gave us the tech, I don't remember which. In 500 ad we researched Chivalry and began the creation of the Indian horde.<br />
<br />
By 830, we had amassed 21 elephants and were readying for the invasion of Carthage when one of my advisors whispered in my ear, &quot;Perhaps, sir, you could send some of our glorious elephants on a trial run on those dirty Perians you've left around, thereby setting off a Golden Age and speeding our military production.&quot; &lt;Smacks own head in amazement&gt; Now why didn't I think of that earlier! &lt;grumbles at own thickheadedness&gt;<br />
<br />
The elephants made quick work of Tarsus and Bactra, leaving the Persians one island city south of Carthage and ,yes, setting off the very useful Golden Age. The very next turn, our plans were to be changed as the Romans landed a few Legionaries near our ivory town of Hyderabad and taking it. The town was quickly retaken and our horde made a slight change of course to the north and landed at Antium. The Roman Invasion had begun.<br />
<br />
The Roman Legionaries were a nuisance but really no match for the mobile elephants as the ability to retreat and regroup wore down the Romans. Rome was the 2nd city to fall in 1010 and by 1130 Leptis Magna had fallen, ending the Roman Empire.<br />
<br />
The hordes were not to be rested and the Carthage Invasion was finally begun, featuring a dual attack using the veterans from the Roman war from the north and a new horde landing on the southern shores. Carthage was taken without a hitch, their Numidean Mercenaries hopelessly outdated, and the Carthage War was over in 1220.<br />
<br />
Time for an update on tech. Once Chivalry had been researched, our science was dropped to 0% with just 1 scientist in the town of Hyderabad working on the secret of Engineering while we gathered gold at a huge pace. After 20 turns and the scientist halfway there, we entered the Golden Age and acquired Theology from the Library. Given our huge boost to trade, we changed our strategy and switched to Education at full speed. We would trade for Engineering a few turns later in a luxury swap. Using our 4-turn research, we pulled away from the competition and quickly reached Navigation and Magellan's Voyage by 960ad. Our caravels would be able to take our troops anywhere in the world now. We next headed to Military Tradition and got there in 1290, shortly after the Carthage War.<br />
<br />
Our next target wasn't as obvious as the first two and a decision had to be made. Scandinavia and the Celts to the east were by far our closest neighbor, but they were weak and probably wouldn't be strong for a long, long time. Seeing that our Elephant Horde would soon be replaced by Cavalry, we decided to forgo the easy route and give our new troops a good test - Greece.<br />
<br />
Greece was easily the leader of the non-Indian world, with nearly twice the cities of the next largest nation and placing 2nd so far in tech. Greece's biggest weakness was that their nation was split in two. The origional Greek state was at the southern end of the main continent, while the other half occupied the old Babylonian territory on the west side with the Ottomans in between. They were halfway across the world, but much of that was ocean and our enhanced caravels would be able to cross in around 3 turns. 39 cavalry left the old Carthaginian city of Theveste in 1290ad and crossed the high seas.<br />
<br />
In 1310, our troops landed on the southern coast of Greece. Eight turns later South Greece was taken. Cavalry are so much fun! Peace was made with Greece while we cleared the path to their northern half and in 1355 we declared war on the Ottomans. The Ottomans foolishly had been pursuing the religious path of the tech tree as their Sipahi may have lengthened their defense. As it was, their 5 cities fell in 7 turns and they were reduced to a wandering settler in 1390.<br />
<br />
Once again I faced a decision. The Greeks to the west or the Germans to the north. The Germans decided things by settling two cities in the wasteland that used to be South Greece. War was declared in 1395. Mainland Germany fell in 1415 - 4 turns and all that was left on the main continent was Greece. We broke peace with Greece in 1420 (by this point who cares what are rep is.) Our well-positioned troops took Greece in 3 turns.<br />
<br />
In 1415 an invasion force arrived at the north end of the Celt/Viking island - now completely Celt. By 1435 we had razed Oslo and taken Nidaros (Colossus and Great Lighthouse) when we reached the IA. A late-arriving fleet of galleons is about to transfer 30 cavalry from the now-desolate mainland to the Celtic island while new forces gather to island-hop and finish the scattered remains of my enemies. Germany has 3 cities remaining, the Vikings 2, Greece 2 and the Celts 6. This game is nearly over. :)  I probably could've had a better pace, but I'm somewhat inefficient and really not too motivated into hurrying things along. All I want is to win and have fun. Looks like this game was a success! Taking out the world without wading through Riflemen (ugh) has been a blast. I'll give the final tally in the next spoiler.</div></div><hr />

Early Contacts<br />
Entered the MA in 90 BC after getting Construction + 60g from Persia for Poly.  Previous to this, in 250BC, a suicide galley made the trip due east from the northern part of the island and reached land (1st galley died but did show sea squares so I tried a 2nd).  I meet the Vikings in 250BC, Babylon in 210BC, Germany in 130BC, Ottomans in 70BC, and Celts in 70AD.  This little galley had quite an adventure!<br />
<br />
I estimate that Persia had gained contact with the Vikings sometime around 100AD (Vikings had the Great Lighthouse) but they did not know anyone else.<br />
<br />
I get Monarch for Liturature in 10AD and revolt.  Another trade that year also lands me Fuedalism.  I also get Republic in 170AD but am afraid to switch since I have a large amount of archers &amp; spears to keep my military even with Persia.   I calculate that the cost of upkeep will kill my research rate.  At this point of the game, due to Persia having the great wall and the iron (thus pikeman and immortals), I am trying to reach Chivalry as fast as possible.  I buy Monothesium from Babylon in 380AD and research Chivalry at max possible rate.<br />
<br />
I meet Carthage in 330AD and determine that thier island would make a nice addition, especially since, south of mutton valley, there is a spot where a galley can make it safely across the sea in 1 turn.  It will take 2 turns to land, but, with enough galleys, it should be doable.<br />
<br />
Vikings declare war out-of-the-blue in 470AD.  I ally Babylon just to stir up trouble.  This apparently leads to a world war, with Babylon and Greece beating the stuffing out of the Vikings, Ottomans, and Germans.<br />
<br />
(almost) Non-Stop War <br />
In 490AD, I finally research Chivalry.  Prebuilds in northern towns will give me 4 elephants the next turn.  I wait till 570AD to launch my attack on Persia, trading them Chivalry for Invention &amp; 5g 1 turn before so I can upgrade my archers (they don't have horses and neither did the Vikings who are still thier only contact).  By 680AD they are toast.  They are also quite nice in completing the Great Library for me during the war.<br />
<br />
In 720AD, I declare war on Carthage.   This is a real slog due to a couple of cities on hills and thier 2/3/1 UU (I initiate thier golden age).  Many, many elephants die.  However, I have 7 or 8 cities pumping out new units every 3 to 6 turns so they are readily replaced.  By 830AD, Carthage is relagated to an offshore island.  I use this time to replenish elephants and get ready for Rome's Legons.  By 870AD, Carthage is gone.<br />
<br />
I attack Rome in 870AD (also triggering thier Golden Age) but it takes me till 1020AD to finish her off.  I get overextended a couple of times, attacking cities with too few units.  It costs me many turns and some war weariness kicks in.  I also rush the Forbidden Palace in the Carthage lands in 900AD.<br />
<br />
Astronomy is bought in 950AD from Babylon.<br />
<br />
In 1070AD, I launch a large landing force towards the Celts (18 elephants on 6 caravels).  I also declare on the Vikings a short time later, capturing thier wine island as well as all the cities (except 3 Babylon cities) on thier island.  Both are done by 1200AD.  I get the Pyramids (Celts) and Colosus (Vikings).  Magellan's is rushed with a GL in 1150AD on the home continent.<br />
<br />
Military tradition is researched around 1200AD.<br />
<br />
Around 1230AD, I declare war on Babylon.  All three cities on the outer island are captured immediately.  By 1260AD, I have captured UR with Leonardo's workshop.  Many Pikeman/Spearman/Catapults are upgraded (most elephants are already cavalry).  <br />
<br />
By 1320AD, Babylon is destroyed and I declare war on Germany.  2 German cities are captured in 1325AD and, IBT, culture grows in a bunch of Babylon cities with new temples, triggering a Domination victory, Firaxis score of only 4464 :(   I was able to play in about 26hr and 30min which is very quick for me.  Someday I'll finish a game before 1000AD.<br />

Great game Ainwood :goodjob:   I really enjoyed the map.  I missed Gotm27 and wished I hadn't after reading the spoilers as naval movement is a weak point in my game.  I was really glad to discover that I had to utilize it for this game.<br />

Nice game Drazen.  I'd like to get 4-turn research going in MA but I never seem to bet able to get there.  I guess I should have rushed the FP in the southern end of the island rather than in Carthage.</div></div><hr />

Yes, RNG is Random Number Generator. Should really be PRNG (P for Psuedo) because there's no such thing as random, but I won't go there :).<br />

OCC = One City Challenge. It's a where the human player restricts themselves to just one city. I think Drazek is being ironic about the Vikings.</div></div><hr />

The Middle Ages began with India’s continued build up towards war, and the exploration of the world.  To revisit the AA for a moment.  In 730 BC, I was fortunate enough to witness a Carthaginian galley cross over next to my city at the mouth of the Mutton River.  While Hannibal built the Lighthouse a few turns later, he had shown me a path across the western sea.   It took me a while to get to Map Making and by 100 BC I was sailing across to see Carthaginian lands.  Sailing counterclockwise around his lands I spotted a red boarder in 10 AD, and met Caesar the next turn.  I watched a few Roman/Carthaginian battles and came to the conclusion that they didn’t like each other very much.  I also explored clockwise and spotted the island south of Carthage which Hannibal had already settled.  When I reached the western portion of Rome/Carthage Island, I took a chance and headed directly west.  I survived two suicide turns and ran into Babylon in 270 AD.  I followed the coast south and had met everyone by 450 AD.  The Vikings were running a 2CC and knew all of the first tier techs in the AA, but that was it.  The Celts were in the MA and owned a few Viking cities.  The Germans were fighting the Babylonians, and the Greeks and the Ottomans were having a spat as well.  <br />
<br />
The Library was hand built in Bombay in 310 AD, and Sun-Tzu’s in 620 AD.  I continued researching the lower science tier using the Qitai philosophy of getting to Mil Tradition as quickly as possible and allowing the Library to pick up the items I didn’t research.  I then resold a tech, but only when I could get a good price for it, usually gpt.  I am tired of falling behind in tech in these games, and I wasn’t going to allow it to happen this time.  <br />
<br />
X-man built the Great Wall in Susa, right on the boarder.  In 780 AD, the second Indo-Persian War began, and the next turn Susa fell, although it was bloody.  While the campaign was initially a bit slow due to Immortal counterattacks, the mighty Jumbos began to turn the tide and in 950 AD, X-man breathed his last.<br />
<br />
Needing to get the Lighthouse so the Indian Republic can take part in overseas trade, immediate preparations began for an invasion of Carthage.  The war would have a goal of capturing the four western Carthaginian cities.  In 1060 AD, the mighty Indian fleet sallied forth, declared war and on the next turn landed a force of 20 Jumbos, 5 cats, and 3 pikes on the Carthaginian coast.  I enticed Caesar to ally with me for the knowledge of Engineering.  It took 17 turns to capture the four cities.  The capitol of Carthage (Lighthouse) was an especially tough nut to crack, requiring multiple attacks. The siege of Carthage took seven turns and I recorded 17 kills to Hannibal’s 7.  Multiple retreats helped immensely.  What also helped was a pillaging campaign ala Sherman which cut the western portion of Carthage in half and disconnected all strategic resources.  <br />
<br />
I waited the remaining 3 turns to cancel the alliance and got a nice 15 gpt from Hanny for my efforts.  Caesar continued the war, and in 1360 AD, Hanny called wanting to renew the peace.  By this time I had cavalry massed in Carthage.  I simply said “no,” and in 1370 AD, Carthage ceased to exist.  In 1380 AD, I entered the IA.<br />
<br />
I know I got a leader or two somewhere during these wars.  If I remember, one was used for the Sistine Chapel and one made an army, but I didn’t make a note of either.  I will go back and check F7 for dates.<br />
<br />
Now we get to compare the overall strategy of each of us.  I hindsight, I suppose my strategy was somewhere in between the warmongering/murderer approach and the peacenik approach.  I suppose you can call it the peace through excessive strength, then stomp really hard.<br />
<br />
Reading the thread: in my game, Greece also was a powerhouse, although they didn’t beat up on the Ottomans as much.  I’ll try to get a map from the saves.</div></div><hr />

First post is here. (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;postid=1583760#post1583760) Ancient Age 4000BC - 70BC<br />
<br />
 Assessment: <br />
At the beginning of the MA we just ended the 2nd Persian war and treacherous Xerxes is already polite again. We are in contact with Persia, Carthage (having 2 settlements north of Delhi on &quot;our &quot; ivory), Rome (their galley showed up), Greece, Germany and Ottomans (found by our surviving galley). We have the biggest culture and our power is among the top players.<br />
<br />
All ancient wonders are built; we have GLib and HGardens, Carthage has GLight and will be our 1st target after Xerxes is dealt with.<br />
<br />
 3rd and Last Persian War <br />
440ad our lux deal with Persia expires and we declare war. Our elephants will be the strike force dealing with the pikes and our longbows will be the offensive defense against Xerxes' immortals; he still has no horses and thus no mounted units. Our 1st attack triggers our Golden Age and we crank out lots of elephants in the sequel. In 460 Carthage's Sabratha joins us with ivory. Happiness! We move thru (former) Persia as fast as we can build elephants to replenish our losses and garrison forces. 520 we capture Arbela with iron and update spears to pikes, warriors to mercenaries. <br />
580 we attack Persepolis w 17 elephants and capture The Pyramids and Leonardo's. In 640 we get our 2nd Great Leader who creates an elephant army allowing us to build the Heroic Epic.<br />
680 we destroy the Persians. Xerxes doesn't want to tell us the secret of banking for peace and thus is killed and the secret of banking is temporarily lost again.<br />
<br />
In 500 Carthage signed an alliance w Persia vs. us and as the war against Persia comes to an end, we start shipping units to  Carthage. In 680 we capture Carthage with GLight connecting furs and allowing trade with Rome: more happiness.<br />
<br />
Xerxes also signed alliances with the Keltoi (we sign-up the Vikings against them) and Babylon (we sign-up Germany against them). Both gave us little trouble.<br />
<br />
 War against Rome <br />
In 930 we discover military tradition and upgrade our elephants to cavalry. 960 we begin our attack on Rome by loosing 3 cavs in killing Rome's knight army. 990 we capture Rome's saltpeter city and continue to move north capturing one city after the other, still going strong at the end of the Middle Ages in 1100.<br />
<br />
 Research and Wonders <br />
Great Library gave us everything up to and including chivalry, gunpowder and printing press. We started research on chemistry in our Golden Age and got it 790 the same turn as the AIs got chemistry and astronomy. Keltoi give us astronomy for peace and chemistry. Afterwards we researched metallurgy, mil tradition, physics, magnetism, theory of gravity. We traded for music theory, banking, navigation.<br />
<br />
We captured The Pyramids and Leonardo's from Persia, Great Lighthouse from Carthage, and built Sistine Chapel (500) in Bangalore, Copernicus's in Delhi (900).<br />
 <br />
Industrial Times begin 1100 while the Wonder Race for Newton's (we want to make Delhi our super science city) and Magellan's is on. Ottomans fight Greece and therefore are probably in their Golden Age; we should get Newton's but will not get Magellan's without another Leader from the Roman war.<br />
<br />
 World at War: <br />
We fight vs. Rome, Germany and Keltoi; Ottomans vs. Greece, Babylon vs. Germany,  Keltoi  vs. Vikings.<br />
I might go for diplomatic victory. :D <br />

<br />
I surmised that the Keltoi would be easy pickings, and there was plenty of open territory to land troops without having to take a rep hit for a surprise attack.  Also, the Keltoi homeland would provide easy access to the continent shared by the Babylonians, Ottomans, and Greeks. My only concern about not going first against the Romans was it would give them time to solidify control of its landmass.<br />

 And the continent was big enough to justify planning my Forbidden Palace on it.<br />
 And it was reachable by galleys. I could ship my troups easily from the Persian theater.<br />
 And it was close enough to Delhi to not be totally corrupt.<br />

 <br />
<br />
I expanded westward because it could be reached safely by a galley.  I set up 6-8 galleys to constantly ferry troops over.  They would load just south of mutton valley and head directly west.  That way, the galley would end the turn on a coastal square, with no threat of sinking.  When galley capacity exceeded the number of units available for transport, I fortified 1 or 2 galleys on the Carthage side.  This provided protection and allowed a 1 turn transport to the island by galley hopping.<br />
<br />
The celts were too far and I lost many suicide settler galleys trying to reach the island north of the large continent early in the game.  This really detered me from attacking them till Astronomy was researched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bolka</div><div class="date">Feb 13, 2004, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That sums it up pretty well.<br />
<br />
There is indeed a passage that can be used for galleys to cross between the two continents without any risks. <br />
The low corruption helped a lot, I could build my FP in 21 turns, without need of a GL, and since both civs were small and quick to anihilate, I could keep a lot of their population with reasonable risks of city flips (I still had 2). So as soon as the FP was completed, I had a nice and productive continent.<br />
<br />
For me taking that contienent was also a step towards domination, which I had in mind since failry early.</div></div><hr />

Third, they had furs and a lot more strategic resources, two horses and at least one extra iron.  (I didn't want my sole source to evaporate on me.)  Finally, because I wasn't to magnetism yet, I couldn't ship anything from Babylon/Scandanavia/Greece back home anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I found that the island was fairly rough going, even with elephants.  The Roman and Carthage UU's each have defence of 3 which made them tough even though they were behind an age.  The 3/3 combo for the Roman Legion can put up a good defensive fight, especially in cities on hills over pop 6.  For whatever reason, Carthage &amp; Rome seemed to have a lot of these in the SE half of the island.  Once I was able to punch thru to the city of Rome, it was relatively easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Finishing Persia<br />
30 AD – Just declare war to Persia again to find that the Iron Source just migrated to my territory the next turn ! So I will produce some warriors while moving slaves to road this source.<br />
70 AD – The Ex Persia and Iron Town (Susa) is mine. I will go on defence while regrouping and waiting for the cash &amp; warriors to be ready for the final.<br />
90 AD – I decided to follow passing Carthaginians galleys up in the NE. I wander a suicide galley that survives and found a town.<br />
I then meet in order : Greece (110 AD) – Ottomans (190 AD) – Vikings (230 AD) – Germans (260 AD)<br />
250 AD – Finished the Great Lib and upgraded 9 Swords and I have still 9 Warriors to upgrade I have also 16 Spears &amp; 6 Cats &amp; 5 Galleys.<br />
270 AD – I was ready to settled on the Romans – Carthaginians island but I could not because Carthaginian borders just expanded as I had my settler ready to disembark. I will continue to search the seas in the meantime. I notice Rome &amp; Carthage are fighting. This is just plain normal. History repeats itself :D<br />
280 AD – Pyramids are mine I just win Persepolis, loosing only 2 archers and 2 swords killing 4 Spears &amp; 2 archers at least. I will now wage war while fishing for leader. I am not in hurry since I am clearly leading.<br />
300 AD – Bactra is mine. I fell to raze the town that is on RCP 4 while the rest is built on RCP5. Not critical though.<br />
320 AD – Gordium is mine.<br />
360 AD – I rush the Forbidden Palace with my First Leader in Persepolis with an Elite Sword fighting for Antioch which fell.<br />
390 AD – I negociate an ROP with Romans in order to move troops to their island and go after the Carth.<br />
420 AD – Second Leader. I build an army and Arbela is mine. No more Persia.<br />
I am still searching with a lone scientist while improving my infrastructure with Markets, Cathedrals, Aqueducts and the occasional courthouse. I am not decided to multiply the towns and building in order to be fully dedicated to the 100K path. I have embassies with everyone.<br />
<br />
Conquering the Lighthouse<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads6/GOTM28_460ad.jpg<br />
460 AD – I have a sufficient force in the second island plus a settler so I declare war to Carthage so that I can build a town with my settler grabbing horses and furs. Already landed with the Roman ROP are 3 swords &amp; 1 Spear &amp; 1 settler. 3 galleys will add an empty army to be filled with 2 Medieval Sword &amp; 1 Cat &amp; 2 Archers.<br />
490 AD – Utica is mine<br />
510 AD – Rome Declare peace with Carthage. I force an alliance with 8 GPT &amp; 16 GP. I am searching with a lonely scientist making 196 GPT per turn so I can afford this help of the mighty legions.<br />
540 AD – Leptis Minor is mine.<br />
590 AD – I have just conquered the Great Lighthouse from former Carthaginian Capital. I can thank Rome because I had 3 Arc out the town and going after some Roman troop. I also thank my six cats that helped softening the population &amp; defence. I will rest a bit in order to plan my next moves. Unsure what I should do next. I will go after the last town. I watch Rome attacking it with a Roman Legion Army during 2 turns and then size the opportunity to kill the last to defendant and Carthage are only existing on small islands.<br />
<br />
Expansion on culture and territory ?<br />
640 AD – Greece &amp; Carthage &amp; Rome are at techs parity. So I go for Invention at 70% in order to start being in advance. Greece is fighting Ottomans. I was busy exploring with the lighthouse so I amanage to grab contacts and emabssies to all civs. German being the last one to be spotted.<br />
I am delaying my GA trying to trigger it by a Wonder thus building infrastructure.<br />
800 AD – Carthage attacked on of my parked WE on the island NE and triggers my GA.<br />
830 AD – Banking in 4 turns. Economics, Chemistry and all the rest will follow at the same rate. I did not go to any optional tech, hoping that the AI will search them...<br />
840 AD – Declare War on Ottomans and kill them.<br />
880 AD – Declare War on Germany. They have dyes.<br />
1010 AD – GA ended with many Wonders and Infra. Greeks come to exchange. I could have add some lux but I wait and I must then Navigation &amp; WM &amp; 30 GP &amp; 12 GPT vs Banking. I trade also banking to Rome for some GPT<br />
1070 AD – I see 5 legions attacking the Carthage Capital on Wine Island, but the third Legion choose to pillage the tile. Due to this they live the town only defended by one Archer that I can kill and take this wine city.<br />

Slipped into Democracy and put research at full throttle.<br />

Finally, a turn before Navigation was discovered, a lone galley finally made it  to a strip of color far to the East.  Soon, caravals were following, and as the MA began to draw to a close, I finally had met all my nieghbors.</div></div><hr />

I've got a 4 tech lead on Persia (with RP due in 4 turns) and lots more on the rest of the world. I've got all the land from the mountains north with a well defended city in Mutton Valley. The Persians have many more units (I'm weak compared to them) and have Sun Tzu &amp; Leo's. They have saltpeter via trade (muskets) and iron (immortals), but no horses (cavalry) and I've got lots of muskets (future infantry) &amp; cannons (future artillery).

<br />
OVERVIEW<br />
<br />
I entered the Middle Ages in 450 BC, as a monarchy, without having gone to war with Persia.  My goal from before the start has been a 100k cultural victory.  My general plan is the standard high-scoring one: expand to the max as soon as possible while maintaining as high a research rate as possible, and leaving the building of happiness buildings for when there’s no units or institutes of learning to build.<br />
<br />
WHAT I DID WHILE RESEARCHING CHIVALRY<br />
<br />
After building the Great Lighthouse in 825 BC, I sent out two galleys – one east and one west - who then met all the civs by 290 BC.  (The eastern galley sailed SE, and slowly circled the main southern continent, finally spotting Babylon.)<br />
<br />
By the time I entered the Middle Ages, I was even with the leaders in tech.  Still a monarchy, it took me 19 turns to research feudalism, which I then traded for monotheism from Babylon after pushing thm into the Middle Ages.  With chivalry next in 150 BC, I declared war on Persia for the first time, using 23 archers, 6 spears, and one violated RoP to take Tarsus and Arbela (iron) on the first turn.  A third city fell in 50 BC, and I agreed to peace in in 190 AD, just as I researched chivalry and almost ran out of archers, I made peace with Persia, picking up 165g and 27gpt.  There was no big rush to finish them in a war of attrition, now that they were defenseless without iron.<br />
<br />
THE GOLDEN AGE<br />
<br />
I switched to republic on the next turn, and spent the next 20 turns building War Elephants.  The FP was completed in 350 in the center of our continent – my plan was to finish off Persia, and then move the palace to the Roman-Carthaginian continent, which I planned to conquer before anyone else learned of my betrayal of the Persians.  I had 13 elephants ready by 420, enough to invade Persia and kick off my GA.  I picked up a Leader in 460, and eliminated Persia by 590.  Their spearmen and longbows didn’t have a chance.  Best of all, Persepolis gave me the Pyramids, Hanging Gardens, and Sun Tzu’s.<br />
<br />
DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES<br />
<br />
By the time the GA ended in 630, I had enough infrastructure to sustain a four-turn research rate for the rest of the Middle Ages.  I was well ahead of the other civs in tech, and doing well selling what I wanted to them.  At this point, I invaded Carthage, which had six cities on the southern coast of their continent.  Their hoplites fared poorly against the elephants, and Carthage was eliminated in 690.  In 740 I upgraded 20 cavalry in Leptis Magna – the end of my serious military build-up for the rest of the game – and attacked Rome the next turn.  The Romans had a lot of legionnaires and some pikes, but were no match against cavalry, and were eliminated in 830, giving me control of a second continent.  The place was moved to Hispalis in 810.<br />
<br />
LOOKING AHEAD<br />
<br />
I had built Copernicus on my own, but no other wonders besides the Lighthouse.  I was researching comfortably at a four-turn rate, and expect it to continue in the Industrial Age.  The southern civs thought nothing but the best of India.  My plan to reach cultural domination was to continue to expand in the south, taking the three weak civs – Germany, Babylon and the Vikings – while keeping Greece and the Ottomans as trading partners.  (The Kelts were a toss-up.)  Only then would I think about filling up the two northern continents with additional cities.  At this point there was no need, because I had conquered more than enough to keep me busy building in the cities I had, with what spare gold was available earmarked for a few corrupt northern cities, and the ones I intended to take in the south.</div></div><hr />

I finished him off with cavs. I also was involved in a phony war with Rome. The time marched on and Persia is now relagated to a small island off the Carthage coast. <br />
I am still the tech leader. My terrible RNG resulted in no leaders the entire war to build the palace in Perseopolis. I have my continent and the lead and I'm planning to go after Carthage and Rome next.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In 490BC I eliminated the Persians so I had the southern part of the island. <br />
<br />
At 10AD (4 turns into MA) I had 24 towns with 10 Libraries and 8 under construction. The capital was at Kolhapur (upper right in pic) as I had messed up my first attempt ever at a Palace Jump to Persepolis. You might say I had 1 1/2 cores at this point. From the following pic you can see I had most of my 22 Workers building in the south. The roads/mines/irrigation were virtually complete in the north. Government was Republic. <br />
<br />
http://civfanatics.net/uploads6/HD28_Spoil2_2.JPG <br />
<br />
I successfully jumped the palace to Persepolis in 230AD bringing the southern core fully online. <br />
<br />
Engineering was first at 6-turns. Navigation was researched in 360AD. I didn't jot down the intervening techs; (the second core was set up about Education time) they were roughly a 5.5-turn average. After Nav I did the bottom path + Chivalry at 4-turn. We had a GA starting at 510AD which allowed us to finish universities almost everywhere. <br />

Trading with neighbors makes the Ancient Age fairly simple to advance as quickly as possible, and by the second half of the Middle Ages, most fairly large civs have enough infrastructure to research quickly.  I think early research-based wins are won by how quickly the first few techs of the Middle Ages can be learned, and your game is a prime example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grotius</div><div class="date">Feb 13, 2004, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, this is only my second GOTM, and in fact only my second epic game after a long break from Civ, and I'm clearly out of practice.  I seem to be the only person in the thread that didn't manage to dispatch the Persians in the Middle Ages -- except for those folks who are pursuing a cultural win, which I'm not.  I could've kicked Xerxes' butt, mind you; I just made a couple of dumb mistakes.<br />
<br />
In the ancient age, Persia and I had fought two wars to a standstill in mutton valley, which I hold with a town (Lahore) that seems destined not to grow past 7 or 8.  After our second peace treaty, I built up a Stack of Death of War Elephants and  Musketmen.  I had a good stack of 25-30 when Xerxes started wandering through my territory, so I ordered him out, and of course he declared war.  <br />
<br />
My Stack immediately marched south to Susa, on the northeast coast.  He threw an endless stream of Immortals (stacked with his musketmen to withstand counterattacks) at my stack.  He whittled down my stack, but not enough to prevent me from taking Susa after a few turns.  That was all great -- but I chose not to raze the city.  Big mistake.  I figured I'd keep conquering other cities, thereby diminishing the flip risk.  And I was worried about the diplomatic penalties of razing.  (I'd met most of the world by this point; in fact, I'd met a bunch in the ancient age.)<br />
<br />
So I started marching on the next Persian city, and at the same time I started a temple in Susa with the intention of rushing it.  Naturally, Susa flipped.  I had kept a few elephants around Susa in anticipation of this possibility, but they died en masse attacking the city this second time.  So then my stack started heading back to Susa.  But by this point the stack was dwindling, and while I was sending reinforcements down from the north, war weariness was kicking in.  (I was in Republic.)  It didn't help that Xerxes got Military Tradition before me, and suddenly his Cavalry started slicing up the remainder of my stack.  I made peace, reluctantly, having gained no cities at all.  :(<br />
<br />
And that's where I ended the Middle Ages -- still dividing the continent with Xerxes.  I was doing okay on research, but here again I made a bonehead mistake.  I left a bad trade deal open on the trade window; hit ESC to check other competing offers; and returned to the bad deal and inadvertently accepted it.  :(  I ended up paying a civ twice as much gpt for a tech as I intended.  Ouch.  I just know one of these days I'll also hit &quot;This means war&quot; when I mean to click &quot;Would you listen to a counter-offer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've still got a chance at a win, but my options are narrowing.  I'm not the tech leader, and without a bigger base, it's hard to see how I can become the tech leader.  That in turn will make it tougher to beat Xerxes militarily, who has always been a tech or two ahead of me.  And obviously it will make it hard to win a space race.  Culture is out.  That leaves diplomatic victory.  I guess the only upside of my failure to raze is that everyone still loves me (except Xerxes).  But to get a diplo win, I have to be one of the two candidates, and it's not clear I will be.  It's too bad, because I was the histographic leader coming out of the ancient age, and now I've dropped to third place.<br />
<br />
Still, it's been a really exciting game.  It actually makes me want to have Xerxes as a neighbor again.  He makes it easy to decide to be a warmonger.  :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I entered the ME in 450BC, in the middle of exploring the world. I got contact with all the rest of civs a couple of turns later. In 310BC, I finished research on the Republic. A couple scientific civs were also in the ME at this point. I then gifted the last one, Greece, into the new age. Between them, they had learned Engineering and Feudalism. I used my newly found knowledge of governments to obtain both of the techs. My plan, as I said earlier, was to go straight for cavalry and quickly take out all three of the nearby civs. These certainly are the right techs for that plan :) <br />
<br />
I next started a 40-turn gambit on Invention, timing a pre-build to land Leo’s on the right turn. I used the money gained during this period to build up infrastructure. Towards the end, I started pumping out horses too. Persia beat me to Invention by 10 turns but there was little I could do to speed up research by then so I simply finished out my 40 turns. I next continued along the lower tech path straight towards Military Tradition. As I recall, it took 14 turns to discover the four necessary techs. All the rest of my research would take place at the 4 turn rate.<br />
<br />
In 320 AD, the Romans declared war for some reason and attacked my two towns on their continent. My veteran pikes easily held them off. I brought the Carthaginians into the war and after that Caesar left me alone, concentrating on my ally instead. Carthage did not do well.<br />
<br />
By the time I reached MT, Persia had gotten Education. We were definitely the scientific powerhouses. Everyone else was far behind. We traded techs to gain parity with each other.<br />
<br />
Two hundred years of war<br />
<br />
In 620AD, I upgraded 50 horses to cavalry and attacked Persia. I also accepted a Roman offer to collaborate against my former ally, the Carthaginians. This was probably a dumb move because I wasn’t really ready to take on a second front. In any case, the Persian immortals were no match for my cavalry and by 680, the entire home continent was mine. <br />
<br />
I think I went slightly insane with palace moves. Karachi had built the Forbidden Palace right in the middle of the home continent. My idea was to jump the Palace somewhere else. In the middle of the Persian campaign, I got my first – and so far only – Great Leader. For some reason, I decided to use it to build a Palace in Persopolis. I have no idea why. I immediately realized that this was silly, but it was too late. To compound the frustration, the next turn I discovered that I was still 33 rounds away from finishing it! I assume that this must be because I took a couple more Persian cities in that round. Later I tried to switch this stupid Palace build to JS Bach’s. That didn’t work either. Apparently you can't switch a build once it has been rushed by a leader. :( <br />
<br />
In 690, Rome declared war when I demanded she remove my troops. This was a nice moment to have this happen, since I was just starting to ferry troops over from the Persian campaign to their continent, taking out a couple of Carthaginian cities each turn. <br />
<br />
In 710, I was about to launch my assault on the last Carthaginian city, located on the little island to the west, when Carthage flipped, taking three cavalry with it. Then the RNG takes out three more in the attempt to take the island. Urggh! Two turns later, my second attempt to take out the island city succeeded easily and a second opponent went to his just reward.<br />
<br />
The next turn, my cavalry armies got decimated at the gates of Rome, although I did just manage to get take the city and with it, the Great Wall. After I finally took the city, I discovered that I had been attacking across a river! I thought it ran north of the city, not south. Damn! How are you supposed to know these things? The terrain display is useless.<br />
<br />
780 was a happy year. Karachi finished JS Bach’s Cathedral. Since I already had a commercial wonder, this set off my Golden Age. I also discovered Magnetism. This gave me a fifth luxury from the wine island and I traded for the other three, sending the entire realm into WLTK day.<br />
<br />
In 820, I disposed of Caesar and wiped out the last of my rivals on this side of the world, without anyone else ever meeting them and learning that I had been less than honourable. <br />
<br />
At the same time I discovered the Theory of Gravity and entered the Industrial Ages. I have not yet made another move. It is time to make a decision about how this game will finish and I still have not decided what to do next. <br />
<br />
There seem to be two basic choices. Either I can unhook the saltpetre and build a second cavalry army to take out most, or all, of the other civs. Alternately, I can gift the remaining scientific civs into the new era and trade for their tech(s).  If I take the first route, do I research Democracy or the Industrial era techs? Golden Age production is good enough to allow me to research at the 4-turn rate but I’m inclined to go for Democracy and then gift the civs just before I attack. <br />
<br />
A second question is what victory condition to shoot for. If I can get a leader to rush a palace in the other continent, perhaps I’ll try spaceship. Otherwise, I think I’ll go for a quick conquest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Entered the middle age in 110AD. I doubt I was the first in. This era would last until 1470AD when I ented the Industrial age.<br />
<br />
In this era my culture capital would produce the following structures of imporance.<br />
<br />
0130ad Colosseum<br />
0480ad Sun tzu's art of war<br />
0520ad Cathedral<br />
0800ad Sistine chapel<br />
0900ad Forbidden palace<br />
1220ad JS Bach's cathedral<br />
1270ad University<br />
1355ad Magellan's voyage<br />
1440ad Newton's university<br />
<br />
Another 5 wonders in the age. But I lost out on three pretty good once (Leo, Copernicus, Shakespear).<br />
<br />
Just at the start of the era I learned that the Great Lighthouse had been built in Nidaros by the Vikings (170ad). Sometime after that and before I got in touch with them the town had been conquered by the Celts.<br />
<br />
The island was fully expanded and there was no more room to grow. Xerxes was getting on my nerves but I was to affraid of him Immortals. Thou it didn't appear he had to many of them. I decided it was to dangerous for me to allow him to have Antioch (the iron town) so I started constucting my stack of 'doom' of archers, warriors and spearmen, hoping enough would surive the trek down and conqure the town. The war would be in two stages. In the first I took Antioch and two more or his north most towns towns (gordium was one, don't remember the name of the other one as I write this). There was peace. No flipping took place. Could have had something to do with my massive culture, I purchased temples and the mob or warriors I had standing in them. With iron secure I started upgrading and constructing MI's. <br />
<br />
Before the second new war Xerxes had started to build Leos in Pasagarde. Some carefull espionage before the war noted the time of completing of said wonder. With my new units (mostly mi's and elephants) and the grace of our many gods I expelled Xerxes from the Island in 1010ad. Leos had been finished in 900ad, and conquered just a turn or was it two after. While I now controlled the island the war had been failure in the sense that it had not generated a single great leader. Perisia took refuge on a lone island and the city of Tyre (just east of the carthage homeland).<br />
<br />
In 1140ad Rome lands a few legions near my ivory town to the north and declares war on me when I ask them to get the hell of my land. The war is a complete massacre. They manage to do nothing and I slaughter everything that sets foot on our shores. In 1320ad I get my first great leader which I use to rush a Palace in Persepolis making the lower part of my island a whole lot more productive. In 1470ad I get my second one, still at war with rome. I use this to build me and army and defeat some romans so I can build the battle wonders later on. This was also the last turn of the era. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile in far far away Greece they manage to do a wonder upset and build Copernicus in 1230ad (Athens). <br />
<br />
On the other fronts Carthage and Rome are holding their own on their island. Rome the larger one. The Celts have expelled the vikings from their island, leaving the vikings with two towns Stockholm (the one island) and Uppsala (the wine island). Greece is the dominant civ on their island with Babylon, Ottomans and Germany.<br />
<br />
<br />
I notice that Email10 played a game very similar to mine so here are some stats for my culture growth.<br />
<br />
BOMBAY CULTURE (year.culture.per turn)<br />
1010ad :: 04647 :: 053<br />
1200ad :: 05782 :: 061<br />
1395ad :: 08172 :: 074<br />
1560ad :: 10786 :: 089 (industrial age)<br />
<br />
In 1535ad Email10 had 10598 points. I didn't have a note of that year but the closest one at 1560ad I had 10786. I think Email10 had more wonders then me thou so I think I am a bit behind him in scoring culture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can someone point me to a thread that will explain the interest in building palaces or answer the following:<br />
<br />
1. If you build a palace, does it automatically move you capital?<br />
<br />
2. If not, I take it you can have multiple palaces?<br />
<br />
3. Additional palaces apparently help with corruption, yes?<br />
<br />
4. How does this fit in with exploits and palace jumps?<br />
<br />
I have never built a second palace (just used it as a prebuild or temporary switch) and only construct the FP.<br />
<br />
Enlightment would be a grand thing.<br />

Thanks and ciao</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">denyd</div><div class="date">Feb 16, 2004, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. If you build a palace, does it automatically move you capital?<br />
<br />
Yes, building a palace removes the existing palace and places your new empire center in that city.<br />
<br />
2. If not, I take it you can have multiple palaces?<br />
<br />
No, only a palace and and FP<br />
<br />
3. Additional palaces apparently help with corruption, yes?<br />
<br />
There are 2 types of corruption: Type 1-Number of cities (OCN for Optimum City Number), this is set based on the map size/type, although it increases once you build the FP. Type 2-Distance from the capital. This is based on how far you are from either capital or the FP (closer one is used for calcultion. Once both of the factors are combined, the result is applied to the shield produce at the city adding in other factors (government, police station, etc)<br />
<br />
4. How does this fit in with exploits and palace jumps?<br />
<br />
There is a hiccup in pre-C3C that all cities closer to the FP than the Palace are assigned the lowest corruption value for the Type 2 corruption value. This can add a big jump in productivity if your FP is in Berlin, with most of your cities in Europe and you move your capital to Honolulu. The other advantage of palace jumps is you can build your FP next to your capital pretty quickly (little corruption in a high shield city) and then palace jump via a GL (great leader) to the capital of a conquered neighbor. You'll pretty much double your production and you'll now have two cores of cities.<br />
<br />

<br />
When I entered the Middle Ages in 570BC India was a Republic and had been peaceful except for an uneventful war started by Persia.<br />
<br />
Contacts<br />
<br />
After getting Map Making in 1500BC I began investing in galleys to explore the world. By 1150BC I'd sent four, lost one, and one had made a new contact. I continued aggressively exploring and met other Civs as follows:<br />
1150BC Carthage<br />
850BC Germany and Rome<br />
690BC Greece<br />
490BC Babylon<br />
450BC Scandinavia<br />
410BC Ottomans<br />
390BC Celts<br />
<br />
My world map looked like this when I made the last contact in 390BC:<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads6/sirpleb28-2a.jpg<br />
<br />
Research<br />
<br />
When I entered the Middle Ages I was way ahead and thought I could stay there. I was wrong - in the next turn, 550BC, Greece somehow traded to shoot many techs forward. And a few Civs knew Feudalism and Monotheism. So I traded for both and started research of Chivalry.<br />
<br />
In 410BC I learned Chivalry, the last serious research I did. I learned Theology at the forty turn rate and was the first to get it. Surprisingly none of my rivals learned Engineering by then. I'd figured on them getting it long before. I should have gone for it instead of Theology. Oh well, I then started Engineering at the forty turn rate but finished my game before I or anyone else learned it.<br />
<br />
I didn't build a single library. They never became important for my research and as a religious Civ temples were better for gaining culture.<br />
<br />
Claiming the Home Continent<br />
<br />
My goal was domination. Domination begins at home, so Persia would be my first subject. (Bark like a dog X-Man!)<br />
<br />
Upon learning Chivalry in 410BC I flipped a few prebuilds to Elephants and shifted most of my economy to building more. In 250BC I had six, declared war on Persia, began my invasion, and triggered a Golden Age.<br />
<br />
Since I had research turned off except for one lonely scientist, I had a nice bit of income available. I used much of it to short rush additional Elephants. In 210BC I was up to 12 Elephants and had just taken over the Persian iron town - she'd produce no further Immortals nor Pikemen after that.<br />
<br />
I captured all cities instead of razing. I had one city flip back to Persia during the war on her but it was easily retaken.<br />
<br />
In 30BC I took Persia's last town, eliminating her. During the war I'd gained iron, wool, The Pyramids, and a Great Leader.<br />
<br />
I'd previously built a Forbidden Palace on the west coast of my home area, to make use of shields available after a failed attempt to build Great Lighthouse. Nonetheless I decided that a better placed Forbidden Palace was the best thing I could do with the Leader. I abandoned my original Forbidden Palace town (replacing it immediately with a fresh town) and rushed a new one in Persepolis. Most of the southern region was nicely productive after I replaced a lot of irrigation by mines.<br />
<br />
Planning World Domination<br />
<br />
When I finished taking over Persia in 30BC my world looked like this:<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads6/sirpleb28-2b.jpg<br />
<br />
I could safely reach the Carthage/Rome continent with galleys.<br />
<br />
Carthage owned The Great Lighthouse and thus could safely sail to any inhabited land in the world.<br />
<br />
Since I planned to take the Lighthouse from Carthage I would not need any technology on the top part of the MA tech tree. Navigation would be nice for connecting luxuries but wasn't essential.<br />
<br />
On the bottom part of the tech tree it would take something over 30 turns (I estimated 36) to research to Military Tradition. I could take over a good chunk of the world in that time by using gold to rush things instead of researching.<br />
<br />
A final consideration - my rivals didn't seem particularly strong. They wouldn't be doing fast research without my help. My Elephants could remain useful for a very long time if I didn't hurry the world's research pace.<br />
<br />
Until this time I'd been doing 40 turn research because I wanted all available funds for rushing military units against Persia. I now decided I'd keep doing that for the rest of the game. War Elephants would dominate the world.<br />
<br />
I'd start with Carthage to get the Lighthouse of course. Then Rome, just because she had the misfortune of sharing Carthage's continent :)<br />
<br />
It seemed a good idea to stir up the other Civs in the meantime. Greece was the strongest, and with a strong Ancient Times defender to trigger a Golden Age seemed likely to stay that way. So I declared war on her and then allied Ottomans, Babylon, and Germany against her. A bit later I added Celts into the alliance.<br />
<br />
There remained just one troublesome question: &quot;How do you fit two elephants into a galley?&quot;<br />
Fortunately the answer was as simple as it was predictable: &quot;One in the front and one in the back.&quot;<br />
War Elephants were surprisingly good seahands and as an added bonus they rowed for peanuts.<br />
<br />
Carthage and Rome<br />
<br />
In 50AD I declared war on Carthage and my first 16 Elephants sailed into her waters.<br />
<br />
I captured The Great Lighthouse in 90AD, used a captured worker to colonize furs in 110AD, and a captured harbor resulted in having that much needed luxury available at home. In 150AD I took the last Carthage city on her home continent. I gave her peace for some tech and cash - she had four island towns but wouldn't give up any of them.<br />
<br />
I declared war on Rome in 170AD. During the war on Rome I got a second Great Leader and sent him to the homeland, thinking to use him later. Then changed my mind and used him to rush Hanging Gardens.<br />
<br />
In 320AD I finished off Rome and owned the second continent. At that date my military consisted of 42 Elephants.<br />
<br />
Greece<br />
<br />
After claiming the Great Lighthouse, I sent three galleys to explore the seas while I conquered Carthage and Rome. In 270AD, when I started working on a plan for &quot;after Rome&quot;, my world map looked like this:<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads6/sirpleb28-2c.jpg<br />
<br />
Until this time all new Elephants built at home had been shuttled to the ex-Carthage lands. I now started moving the galleys further west along Carthage's south shore and producing new galleys on the east coast of the homeland. New Elephants at home went to the east coast to board the new galleys and a few settlers joined them.<br />
<br />
In 340AD my first group of Elephants sailed from the south ex-Carthage coast toward their next task. At this date Greece completed Sun Tzu's, sealing her fate as my next target. (She was already high on my list because I and most of her neighbors were already at war with her, and because she had a lot of land.) Elephants and Settlers also began sailing east from the homeland.<br />
<br />
In 370AD my troops sailing east from home took an island town from Greece. They stayed on the island to attack two Carthage cities there a bit later when my peace deal with Carthage expired.<br />
<br />
In 380AD my first 18 Elephants landed on Greece's mainland and the invasion began. New troops continued to arrive from ex-Carthage/Rome as quickly as they could heal, move to the coast, and sail. I didn't leave any Elephants on the Carthage/Rome continent - no other Civ would be arriving there in the near future.<br />
<br />
In 390AD I captured Athens and with it Sun Tzu's. And in 440AD I captured the last Greek town, taking her out of the game.<br />
<br />
After Greece, Domination<br />
<br />
While I was attacking Greece, my peace deal with Carthage expired in 400AD. I'd held back 7 Elephants and a Settler in the north, ready to attack Carthage's town on an island there. And I'd left a force on the island she'd shared with Greece. I captured these three Carthage towns quickly, settled to fill in additional space near them, and made peace with Carthage when she was willing to discuss it in 440AD. She was reduced to one town on a small island in the far south, not worth the cost of sending a force to take it from her.<br />
<br />
In 440AD after finishing with Greece and Carthage I needed just 218 more tiles to reach the domination threshold of 1012. My world map looked like this:<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads6/sirpleb28-2d.jpg<br />
<br />
I decided to attack Ottomans next. They had just two towns but it was in nice central territory.<br />
<br />
I soon also declared war on Germany and then on Babylon. By being at war with these three rivals (two when the Ottomans were out of the game) I was able to use the troops in transit from the homeland. Domination was approaching too quickly for those troops to assist the main front but they could stop at locations en-route and still make a contribution.<br />
<br />
At the end of 510AD my world looked like this, for a 520AD domination victory:<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads6/sirpleb28-2e.jpg<br />
<br />
Warfare as a Republic<br />
<br />
My overall approach in this game was:<br />
1) Research quickly to Elephants, building up infrastructure in the meantime.<br />
2) Put all efforts into war after that. No research, no infrastructure unrelated to war, all funds assisting the war effort.<br />
<br />
I stayed in Republic from the time I learned it. Initially I did this to speed research toward Chivalry. But as a religious Civ, why not switch to Monarchy after that? I stayed in Republic because I expected a net gain - the extra funds it produced could be used to rush temples, barracks, settlers, galleys, and elephants.<br />
<br />
Republic has two shortcomings for a highly aggressive game: unit support cost and war weariness.<br />
<br />
Unit support cost was not a major factor for me. My support cost was never as high as the number of units I had, i.e. was never as much as 1gpt per unit overall. This did require aggressive management at first. I did a few things:<br />
1) Disbanded my warriors after switching to Republic.<br />
2) Founded some additional otherwise useless cities, just to increase the number of free units supported.<br />
3) When there wasn't much left to improve on the home continent, joined some native workers to cities.<br />
<br />
At 400AD my unit support cost dropped to zero - gains in city count finally passed my ever growing military size.<br />
<br />
War-weariness was harder to deal with. Striking enemies hard and quickly helps of course. But mainly I just lived with it, using the luxury slider as necessary. That was expensive since I was already using the slider a bit for happiness to increase score. The highest setting I used was 50% luxury near the end of the war on Greece. But even at that level I still had a fairly good net income of nearly 300gpt to spend on other things.<br />
<br />
General Expansion Techniques<br />
<br />
I built numerous temples in this game. Early in the game I used them to expand territory out to sea, to push Persia, and even for happiness because there were few luxuries. Later on, since I was going for domination, when taking cities from other Civs I often rushed a temple quickly to expand borders. The result of all this was that my culture was fairly high and I didn't have to worry much about captured cities flipping.<br />
<br />
I sold most improvements in captured cities to keep maintenance costs down. I just kept a couple of harbors where they were useful and kept barracks while they were still near the front lines.<br />
<br />
When I could, i.e. when there were enough citizens left after resistance stopped, I rushed settlers in captured cities. This sped my progress toward domination by filling in between AI city locations and along coastlines. It also reduced the population of captured cities quickly, further reducing the risk of flips.<br />
<br />
I built Marketplaces in all productive core cities. This was an exception to devoting all efforts directly to war. I built these because I expected them to pay off in the long run through increased income. And as a side effect they increased happiness.<br />
<br />
When sending troops to Carthage/Rome I used a small fleet of galleys as shuttles. The subsequent trips to other lands seemed too far for shuttles. So I built or rushed new galleys at home as required, and when the galleys arrived at the far end I disbanded them there to boost temple and settler production. An especially nice technique was to disband four galleys in a captured town where there was a lot of resistance - the town would then build a settler or temple in just two turns, even though it was still in resistance!<br />
<br />
After priority uses for gold (those mentioned so far) I used the rest of my income to purchase Elephants. Mostly I did this via short rushing. In some cases I also rushed them in fully corrupt newly captured towns which had barracks.<br />
<br />
Short rushing was very useful for me in this game. As an example of its strength (and of a complicated use): I had some cities which produced 20 or slightly over 20 shields per turn in my Golden Age. And a couple of cities reached that level after the Golden Age. At 20s/turn an Elephant can be produced in four turns, wasting 10s on the last turn. Rushing after two turns of production wasn't an option - I didn't have anything available to build which cost 50s. So what I did was: I allowed the city to run one turn of production. Then I switched it to produce a settler, rushed that (10s rushed for 40g, resulting in 30s in the bin), then switched it back to Elephant. It finished the Elephant two turns later. Here's one way to look at the result: Without this rushing the city would produce 3 Elephants every 12 turns. With this rushing it produces 4 Elephants every 12 turns, and I'm adding in 40g every 3 turns. So I'm getting an extra Elephant for 160g. Pretty good value. Another example in this game was cities which produced 15 or 16s/turn. They could be short rushed to MIs after one turn of production and then they'd complete the Elephant two turns later.<br />
<br />
I didn't used anything but Elephants in my advance. Every opponent had a strength 3 defender - Carthage, Rome, and Greece as their UUs and the other Civs had Pikemen. In Rome's case I could count on drawing her out and killing her Legionaires in the open as they attacked. But the other Civs defended with strength 3 units. At times my losses were high - fortified defenders in hill cities were rather tough. At those times I wished for catapults. But the Elephants' retreat rolls helped and I was able to maintain production of new units at a higher level than losses. Overall I was happy I'd gone with just the Elephants. They enabled a fast advance and that counts for a lot :)<br />

I followed essentially the same invasion course as you, but, as usual, you finished hundreds of years ahead of me.  In retrospect, it appears to me that your game was extremely focused and mine was not.  By that I mean that you knew exactly what you wanted to do (domination, only build Temples, no research after Chivalry) and I only knew domination.  I continued to research, trying to get to the magic 4 turn per tech, and built a lot of buildings in my productive cities.<br />
<br />
I also liked your idea of disbanding the Galleys, instead of sending back home for more troops.</div></div><hr />

And the answer was yes.  Your approach seems to be that the additional gold (used to rush elephants, settlers, and temples) made up for researching republic instead of monarchy, paying higher unit costs for a while, and a significantly higher luxury rate.  Assuming that your answer is Yes, republic is worth it - then would you go this route in most cases from now on?

First Spoiler (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=1587317#post1587317)<br />
<br />
At the start of my very late middle ages, in 340 AD, I had X-man down to two cities, I had reposessed his Great Library and Pyramids, and I knew Carthage who had built the Great Lighthouse and found me. The lovely Hannibaline was my main tech trading partner until the Great Library, and she and Xerxes passed on the secrets of Republic, Feudalism, Montheism and Engineering before Xerxes sadly passed away at the hands of my Swordsmen. The closing moments of the Persian war produced a Leader who delivered Sun Tzu in Pasargadae.<br />
<br />
I then needed a new second contact to work the GL magic, so I went exploring. A couple of Galleys made it across the eastern and western seas, and found Rome, the Vikings, Keltoi and a Greek ship. Only Greece seemed to be keeping up in techs, and I guess it was Alex and his scientific freebie that forced the pace at the start of the Medieval. I had decided that world domination would get me a result fastest, so I researched Chivalry at maximum speed to learn how to drive those elephants in the tundra and then turned science off and saved a war chest. Meanwhile the GL delivered Invention, Theology, Gunpowder and the Printing press before it expired with Education.<br />
<br />
As soon as Printing arrived I was able to buy contact with the Ottomans, Babylon and Germany, and I bought embassies with each civ I met to build a dot map of their relative locations. My early contact ships were slowly mapping coastlines, but I still didn't know how they were all connected. However, I did know that everyone was quiet - too quiet. I needed to slow down the tech pace to give my elephants time to take effect, so I declared war on Rome and Greece and bought alliances to get everone else involved - Carthage vs Rome and Ottomans, Vikings and Keltoi against Greece. Pretty soon they all got the hang of it and the world was at war.<br />
<br />
i started to build some elephants, but was having trouble working out how to use them, as I didn't want to risk them in suicide galleys. I expected to have to wait until Navigation before I could enact Operation Global Domination. Then a Roman galley showed up and dropped off a Legionary in my western mountains. This presented two questions:<br />
<br />
1. How did he get here? He certainly didn't have any long haul tech or wonder. I looked very carefully at his arrival point and discovered a single, unique path for safe coast-to-coast transit. Now my elephants had a new purpose in life, and Caesar was a marked man.<br />
<br />
2. Who should kill the legionary? I had a Euro Sword and an elephant both within range. The elephant option was a clear winner as I felt I was in good shape to capitalise on the Golden Age. I was a Republic, with reasonable development and two good productive cores, and any more incursions by Rome would be unlikely to amount to enough to provoke war weariness. I was able to build a world-beating infrastructure, a military and tech lead, and a cash mountain.<br />
<br />
My Golden Age began in 750 AD and the Library delivered Education shortly afterwards. I then beelined to Military Tradition at 4 turns per tech and still saved about 500 gpt. One small problem - no horses for Cavalry, and no one I was at peace with could sell me any. Carthage once had two sources, but Rome had wiped out one of them, near Antium, with a culture push. What a pity, how sad, never mind! I had built up my elephant force and a fleet of galleys on the west coast, and we hit the beach outside Antium in 880 AD at the back end of the golden age and just as the Military Tradition pop-up arrived. After sustaining heavy losses we took Antium, and the (pillaged) horses reverted to Carthage's regrown territory. Nooo problem! Antium delivered up six Roman slaves - just the right number to rebuild a road to connect the horses using my RoP with Carthage. I then bought them from Carthage to upgrade my elephants to Cavalry. Antium even had a Barracks. It was my birthday and Christmas all rolled into one! Antium subsequently grew back with my rushed temple, giving me the horses for the rest of the game.<br />
<br />
Rome quickly fell to my cavalry and produced a Leader who shipped back to India to builld Magellan's Voyage. Meanwhile I researched Navigation, continuing at a 4-turn pace even though the Golden Age had finished, as I had taken care to build libraries and even some universities in the productive cores. I was now in sailing range of the eastern territories, with a complete map of the world and everone's gold after the map trading round. As I had several per-turn deals going with Carthage I decided to play an honorable game, and I didn't press on to complete the conquest of the western continent. I built up a new cavalry force and new Caravels, and shipped some of the Roman conquest force back through the southern canal, formed by Bengal and Pasagardae. I declared war on the Vikings in 1060 AD, and by 1160 AD I had overrun the fringe islands and was at work on Babylon. Babylon was reduced to a single tile island in the Outer Hebrides where they sat out the rest of the game. By then my 20 turn deals had expired with Carthage and I shpped my fleet back through the canal.<br />
<br />
While my eastern troops destroyed the Ottomans and went on to take possession of Carthage's holdings on that continent, I built up another cavalry team and took out most of Carthage to achieve domination in 1230 AD. Strictly speaking I had entered the Industrial era before this, as I researched Magnetism to get Frigates and Galleons, Democracy for the economic boost, and ToG and Steam for insurance. I bought banking from Carthage, intending to boost my income. I never actually built a bank - too busy building cavalry :D. By the end of the game I was a democracy, running zero research and 20% lux tax to counter rising war weariness.<br />
<br />
The shipping logistics made my brain hurt, particularly at the end. I was operating on a &quot;just-in-time&quot; basis when I took down the Carthage cities, worried that both Carthage and Greece only needed Theory of Gravity to complete the Medieval era. At that point Greece would probably get a Nationalism freebie and Carthage would find a way to trade for it, and I'd be up against rifles.  So I was short rushing cavalry, using my fast-depleting war chest, and shipping them across that infuriating western sea, with its slow shallow bits and wide coastal shelf, sometimes one or two units per galleon from different points on the shoreline, jumping ship in mid-voyage to use available movement points, and taking out Carthaginian muskets one or two per turn. <br />
<br />
Like SirPleb, but 600 year later :(, I was rushing temples and settlers in captured cities to grow cultural borders, reduce foreign populations and provide infill towns.<br />
<br />
I made the mistake of building a lot of cannons. They are useless with cavalry unless you plan to play long enough to reach Replaceable Parts and upgrade them to Artillery. I was worried about big cities on hills with muskets, and I was right - they took a heavy toll on my cavalry. But my cannons could never keep pace. Only when they were dropped in place from ships were they able to get within range before the cavalry were ready to charge, and even then they had minimal effect on the defences. i didn't wait for them to catch up, either. I was concerned about counter attacks, and leaving a stack of cavalry outside a city seemed like a recipe for heavy casualties. As it turned out, the AI seemed incapable of any significant counters. I expected Carthage to deploy cavalry in numbers, in which case I'd have been toast, but none showed up. My contingency plan was to take out a couple of Greek cities in breach of a per turn lux deal if I got bogged down in Carthage.<br />
<br />
A fun game! It won't break any records, though I reckon 34 turns from start to end of the domination wars wasn't too dusty considering I was fighting on three land masses. I hampered my progress a bit by making some lux and RoP deals that I didn't want to break, so I could probably have shaved off 50 years or so by being dastardly. And I shouldn't have wasted shields on cannons. But I am pleased that I only built three defenders duirng the whole game, and they only happened because I forgot to check the &quot;always build the previous unit&quot; preference and the AI defaults to defenders.<br />

Actually I'd have built the Marketplaces under Monarchy too. In either government I think they'd increase income enough to be worthwhile. It wasn't so much a matter of how much gold was needed as of how much was wanted - however much I could get, I'd have no trouble spending it :)<br />
<br />

Yes, except in regard to making up for the higher research cost. I doubt that there's actually any research cost to weigh against learning Republic. Learning it quickly can result in getting a lot of other research done cheaper and faster. It gives a huge boost to research, more I think than building libraries in many cities. In this game that boost can be applied to reaching Chivalry quickly. And the Republic tech itself is highly tradeable - in this game I traded it for both Monotheism and Feudalism.<br />
<br />
So I see the question as just a tradeoff between additional gold and unit costs + luxury rate. Before learning Chivalry and going to war I would guess that Republic was worth the cost of research in what it had already gained.<br />
<br />
Originally posted by Txurce <br />

That is what I've been doing for quite a while now, going Republic all the way. At first I thought Monarchy might make more sense in this game. But then I found myself following my established pattern and making Republic work, just based on a gut feel that it was worth the cost.<br />
<br />
This seems like a very good time to check that gut feel. With a religious Civ a good comparison can be made since there's just one turn of revolution. So I've now gone back through some saves to do a Republic/Monarchy comparison :)<br />
<br />
First I double-checked when war weariness was at its worst. This turned out to be at the end of my war on Rome, not at the end of war on Greece as I previously thought. The end of my Greek war was when I set the slider highest, but only because I felt I could afford to spend 50% on happiness then. At the end of my war on Rome war weariness was apparently 37% (whatever it actually means when citizens say that) and I find that the slider needs to be at 60% to get close to total happiness. I'm sure I've had higher than 37% war weariness in other games. But my play in this game was fairly aggressive and I think its worst point is a reasonable basis for comparison.<br />
<br />
Next I played forward from my 310AD save one turn, once in Republic and once changing to Monarchy. And I then noted the resulting domestic advisor numbers at various luxury slider settings. The results are detailed below. Some constants not included in the table:<br />
Unit support was 44g in Republic, zero in Monarchy.<br />
Maintenance was 76g in Republic, 73g in Monarchy (because of three improvements built in that turn. Not a big deal I think.)<br />
Corruption was 158g in Republic, 101g in Monarchy.<br />
I had science set to zero and had no taxmen.<br />
<br />
I didn't try luxury rates higher than 60% because diminishing returns were severe at that point.<br />
I didn't try luxury less than 20% in Monarchy because a number of entertainers would be required. One was required already at 20%.<br />
I didn't try luxury less than 30% in Republic because a number of entertainers would be required. None was required yet at 30%.<br />
<br />
An important thing in comparing the tables below I think is the &quot;!happy citizens&quot; column. At each setting I counted the total number of citizens who were not happy. (I.e. were either content or unhappy.) I think the rows where this number is about the same are the rows which should be compared between the two governments. <br />
<br />
Results:<br />
<br />
<br />
           lux.   !happy   city   entert.    net<br />
 gov't     rate   citiz.  income   cost    income<br />
Republic    60%      6      651     268      105<br />
Monarchy    60%      7      403     171       58<br />
Republic    50%     12      663     232      153<br />
Monarchy    50%     14      407     150       83<br />
Monarchy    40%     29      414     106      134<br />
Republic    40%     36      677     173      226<br />
Monarchy    30%     41      420      79      167<br />
Republic    30%     52      688     131      279<br />
Monarchy    20%     52      426      51      201<br />
<br />
<br />
My interpretation of the results is that I'm definitely better off in Republic, even when I have a fair bit of war weariness. :)<br />
<br />
At some even higher level of war weariness (which can happen!) I guess there would be a break-even point. And unit support costs are clearly a very important factor. Probably a make-or-break one. At that date I had 84 units, was allowed 62, and was paying 44gpt for the difference. If I'd had say 140 units, the picture for Republic would be much worse, paying 156gpt for support, and reducing the net income shown in each Republic line above by 112gpt. Republic would also be a problem if I had less towns of course.<br />
<br />
It is interesting to note that the new Conquests style support cost for Republic is probably having the opposite effect from what was intended by Firaxis. I think they wanted it to be more expensive to support an army in Republic. Instead, I was paying just 44gpt at this date where it would have been 84gpt in the old approach. With the old approach and this 37% level of war weariness, I'd have been roughly breaking even with Monarchy instead of being ahead of it.<br />
<br />
Final note: I wouldn't have minded even being a bit behind Monarchy at this date - that would have meant that most of the time (when war weariness was not that bad) I'd have been ahead anyway.<br />
<br />
Thanks for questioning this Txurce - it was high time for me to check some assumptions I'd been using :) I will definitely continue to strongly favor Republic in my play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AlanH</div><div class="date">Feb 17, 2004, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I my last two or three games I've stuck with Monarchy to avoid war weariness, unit costs and the need for early market places to pay for both. Also I've previously had bad experiences when I've tried Republic. However, in this game I decided to try Republic because ...<br />
<br />
- The unit support cost equation was completely different in this game. Almost all of my cities were over pop 6 by the time I was building my armies, and supporting 3 units each. So I was only paying low tens of gpt for unit support even at the highest level instead of 100 or more.<br />
<br />
- Republic came free out of the captured Great Library, so there was no research decision to make. Typically Republic is very expensive to trade for, and comes at a time when I'd rather be researching the fast units - Chivalry or the lower half of the Medieval tree.<br />
<br />
- My warfare skills are better now, I think, resulting in shorter fights. The whole domination campaign lasted from the first elephant attacked Antium in 880 AD until the last cavalry took Utica and Leptis Minor in 1220 - 34 turns. Each time a civ went down war weariness dropped back<br />
<br />
- During my Golden Age I built markets and libraries in preparation for its end. As a result I had a war chest of over 10,000 gold at the end of the GA, and my markets were able to sustain a happy population with zero lux tax most of the time. War weariness rose to 37% and lux tax hit 20% at the worst point during the Rome campaign if I recall, but only for a few turns.<br />
<br />
- It was low risk. Being religious I could try it and fall back if it wasn't working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Txurce</div><div class="date">Feb 17, 2004, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">SirPleb, thanks for quantifying your instincts to such a degree.  Now here's something funny - I read your chart and jumped to the opposite conclusion!  Why?  Because my anecdotal experience is that monarchy usually allows me to keep the luxury slider 10 or 20% lower than republic in the early stages of military expansion.  Trust me, I'll tilt toward your research over my general sense of things any day of the week.  But one additional factor to consider is that in monarchy, garrisons help to keep the peace, while in republic, they don't.  I usually leave one warrior (occasionally two) in my monarchy cities, until I've captured enough luxuries that I don't need them anymore.  These units basically have no cost.  I wonder if their use would make enough of a difference that luxury costs in monarchy would indeed be 20% lower than in republic - making monarchy the better early choice?  I say early choice, because as territory increases, and more luxuries are acquired, the luxury slider winds up at zero under both governments - at which point republic's efficiency would indeed generate much more gold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zagnut</div><div class="date">Feb 17, 2004, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I stayed in Republic through the entire game.  I never had to move the luxury slider above 20%, and was at 10% most of the time.  I think the small size and relative weakness of the opponents in this game made it easier to operate in Republic.  The wars were short and when I either made peace or eliminated a civ, then the war weariness vanished and I got to start over again.<br />
<br />
Also, it was a good choice to stay in Republic because we could always switch to Monarchy in one turn.</div></div><hr />

At the start of the MA I had around 40 cities, and at the start of the IA around 100 (maybe). Let's say 2 MP's per city, all warriors for the sake of argument.. that's a shed load of shields.<br />

At the end of the MA I had 4 elephants defending the Carthaginian/Roman continent and 9 warriors and 2 spears (don't know where they came from :mischief: ) on the starting continent. I would imagine that Sir Pleb had even fewer defenders.<br />
<br />
The shields I would have needed to spend to get the benefit from lowering the lux rate went elsewhere. 1000 shields is a lot of elephants. Where else could you construct a sentence like that? :)<br />
<br />
IMVHO I think the difference between republic and monarchy makes the decision process a no brainer in most games. Sure, AW games and a few other variants may call for it, but they all tend to be situations where one would naturally have large numbers of units in cities.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if their use would make enough of a difference that luxury costs in monarchy would indeed be 20% lower than in republic - making monarchy the better early choice?<br />
Oops! I forgot entirely to allow for MPs. I guess because I seldom use them. I don't even use them a lot in Despotism to tell the truth. In most games I do use some near the start, to keep slightly oversize towns (e.g. a settler factory) a bit better balanced with smaller towns in how much luxury is needed. But after getting a good number of towns going I tend to pretty much stop using them. I guess this is because I always seem to have something else I want my military units to be doing, and I prefer not to use production to build MPs.<br />
<br />
And still, having said that, I wonder how much MPs might change the balance when comparing Monarchy and Republic? It is difficult to quantify because there's some production cost too. In this game I disbanded 16 warriors when going to Republic. So that's 16 happy faces I could have had at no cost in Monarchy. OTOH, they weren't needed at that date. When MPs would have been useful later on, 16 warriors would be far from enough. And as mad-bax says, 1000 shields is a lot of elephants :lol:<br />
<br />
It is a tough comparison and does depend a lot on style of play I think. For me I'd say Republic still wins by a fair margin most of the time - I don't think MPs can make up for the amount of difference in the numbers even with a fair bit of war weariness.<br />
<br />
There'd be exception cases of course, e.g. always-war and games where the ratio of military units to cities is unavoidably high.</div></div><hr />

By the time you have 40 cities, you also should have enough luxuries that you don't need garrisons.  You'll note that I was talking about the early stages of military expansion. It seems to me in the early phases you can aleays reach Monarchy faster than Republic, just because you have fewer pre-requisites, specially starting with CB as a given. So Monarchy seems to fall out as my preferred government choice, and as you say, it allows the relatively small number of core cities with large pops to be helped by a couple of warriors. The MPs are not free, as they represent an opportunity cost by not becoming swords or being disbanded. But they do look quite cheap at that stage.<br />
<br />
At 40 cities it's questionable whether any investment decisions should be based on trying to keep them all big and happy. Half of them are likely to be totally corrupt, so size only matters for defensive purposes or for score. I'm usually only defending recently captured cities, and then for too little time to make any decisions other than setting them all to taxmen for starvation. For high Firaxis acore you need lots of happy faces, but the Jason score was supposed to avoid the need to take that into account. <br />
<br />
My dilemma is whether or not to switch, and if so when. In this game it was no problem for the reasons I stated, but I'm not nearly as convinced by the argument for researching for, trading for, or switching to Republic under conventional Civ unit cost rules, and outside of the special case of getting the tech free from the Library or in an opportunistic &quot;might as well take it&quot; peace deal.<br />
<br />
What are the compelling reasons why Republic makes more economic sense than Monarchy in the later game?</div></div><hr />

1) Both Monarchy and Republic are optional techs. So I figure that the cost of learning each of them must be justified based on what it pays back, unlike all of the prerequisite techs for each which must be learned just to continue making progress.<br />
2) Switching to Monarchy will not give much of a boost to research. Its cost is paid back by small increases in production, income, and food. None of them is a huge increase. It also gives the benefit of paid labor rushing instead of forced labor but that's usually a small benefit at the earliest dates.<br />
3) Switching to Republic makes the same gains but also dramatically increases income. And this results in dramatically faster research. I suspect that by the time I've researched two more techs after Republic I'm probably around the break-even point on the investment I made in Republic.<br />
4) Republic costs a bit more to research than Monarchy but in my experience it generally pays better in subsequent trade. The AIs seem more likely to go for Monarchy first, making it less likely to be useful for early MA trades.<br />

I just compared my 510AD state in this game as a Republic vs. as a Monarchy. If I maximize purchasing power in both (just 10% luxury to avoid needing entertainers) I get a net income of 620gpt in Republic, 403gpt in Monarchy. That's enough to buy an additional War Elephant in four out every five turns. If I were playing the old Civ/PTW with the original unit support cost for Republic, the difference would be reduced to 144gpt more in Republic. That's still an additional Elephant every two turns. Ten more Elephants at the front lines where they count in the final 20 turns of a domination game.<br />

Thanks SirPleb. It was the balance of unit costs vs. extra gold in the standard game that I wasn't convinced about, but your numbers demonstrate it well. When I stop a nd think about it it's obvious really. Monarchy supports two to four units per city, Republic would therefore cost about three gpt per city more than the free unit level for Monarchy. But Republic cities produce maybe 8 or 9 gpt per city extra, so you should be 5 or 6 gpt per city ahead. That benefit is multiplied by market places as well.<br />
<br />
I'll try out Monarchy switches on a few saves in my game and see if I can confirm the maths.<br />
<br />
And that last paragraph demonstrates another killer differentiator in your games - you had 20 turns of domination warfare? I took over 30! I have a lot to learn :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume we're weighing Republic in pursuit of a military victory, since it's the obvious government for high scores with all of the other victory conditions.  To distill what SirPleb explained, it comes down to having having more gold with which to rush stuff in the later game.  It doesn't mean much with regard to research in this game, as you don't need to go past chivalry to win, but it would if circumstances force you to research as far as military tradition.<br />
<br />
While I suspect that the differences between monarchy and republic just after switching from despotism are pretty small at first, I am now convinced that republic is the way to go overall even when pursuing fast military victories.  This is yet another example of SirPleb helping me to simplify my game.  It doesn't quite rank with SirPleb and DaveMcW explaining that there's rarely any need for happiness buildings (unless going for a cultural victory), but it's close.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I overwrote my turnlog for this game with one from an SG, so I can only describe in general terms what went on, and the dates may be a little off too.<br />
<br />
Research.<br />
Persia got Engineering as her free tech, which I bought for a lump sum payment about 12 turns into the MA. I then wiped out Persia on the same turn and got my money back.<br />
I researched to Education first, then chivalry and then to banking at full speed.<br />
Then I turned down science to 30 - 40% to maintain a 6 - 8 turn research rate.<br />
I was making about 180gpt at this point.<br />
From here I meandered to Military Tradition and finished off with Magnetism and finally Theory of Gravity.<br />
<br />
Infrastructure.<br />
I built temples, libraries, cathederals, markets, unis and banks pretty much in that order everywhere in my cores. Elswhere I built temples, workers, settlers and then cathederals. Towards the end of the MA I had also begun to rush libraries.<br />
<br />
A minimum of military units were built along with 4 galleys.<br />
<br />
Military.<br />
<br />
Carthage built a single city on the southern edge of the starting continent. I reduced Persia to a single city around 10AD with archers, and also kicked the Carthags off my land at around the same time. This short melee produced a leader with which I moved my palace to Persepolis. After buying the free tech, I used an elephant to trigger the GA by killing X-man.<br />
<br />
Played poorly for a while here, and it wasn't until around 500AD that I found the wherewithall to take on the Carthags and Rome. IIRC it was because I didn't do a good job of exploring the coastline and had to wait for astronomy to get across to Carthage.<br />
<br />
I filled 4 galleys with 8 elephants and sent them over the water. 8 elephants agains the Carthags was taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. They were gassed from a long and losing war against Rome. They fell over in a single turn - 3 cities, leaving a single city on an island to the south.<br />
<br />
Rome was next and I declared immediately with the 5 elephants that were not on MP duty. The first unit I had to kill was an army. Fortunately it held one ligionary and two archers, but it took 2 elephants to kill it. I filled another two of the original 4 boats with elephants to continue that war, whilst the others sailed (the long way) round to get ready to take on the vikings who had declared war in the meantime.<br />
<br />
The dozen elephants made short work of Rome who finally capitulated around 750.<br />
<br />
8 elephants took off for Scandinavia around 800AD, and by 1000AD had taken the vikings and the Celts out without further reinforcement. The vikings were left with the wino island which I visited with a boat around 1100AD.<br />
<br />
In around 1050AD I had sent a few Cavalry over to help with the invasion of Babylon. A couple of muskets, four cavalry and four elephants landed and Captured Ur the turn before Babylon got gunpowder. What happened next was less than ideal. A swarm of Azap, swords and Pikes decended on Ur. As soon as the muskets were down to 2HP the Elite elephants took the brunt of the attack and I lost all but one. So then I had to resort to ship chaining and rushing military to prevent myself being kicked off that continent altogether. But in the end at 1200AD I had conquered mainland Babylon and had my eight luxes connected.<br />
<br />
Diplomacy and trade.<br />
None once the MA was reached.<br />
The only trade I have made in the whole of the MA was buying Xerses free tech. No maps, no luxes, no techs, no nothing. Previously I had only traded tech with Xerses in the AA.<br />
<br />
All peace deals other than with Xerses were straight peace for peace. This was an attempt to keep the AI backward and without map knowledge. I don't know if it worked, but I am half an era in front of all the AI and have only been researching at 30-40% and 20% since MT.<br />
<br />
Where I am at - Currently 114 tiles from the limit.<br />

Perhaps the biggest factor in my win was that I took on/out the Persians as quickly as I could rather than trying to wait for my war elephants and suffer under the persian boot for 2 long.

Would that were so for me too. I've come to realize that one of the reasons I don't go for domination wins is that I absolutely hate when my towns flip. Flips give me that cold gut feeling every time and I can't seem to get over it. As a result, I tend to keep a few percent of my attack forces in or around captured towns. It makes my offensive tactics messy, even though in other respects I think my offensive tactics are good.<br />
<br />
N.b: When it comes to towns I've built myself, i.e. towns really unlikely to flip, I have no qualms about leaving them undefended.<br />
<br />
What I need to do is play a few non-GOTMs where &quot;not so much is at stake&quot; and purposely leave captured cities undefended - just to see how much the flips really matter.<br />
<br />
Dunno if this reflection is interesting to anyone, unless they have the same figment of their imagination. I just realized that my version of MP-use probably makes warmongering a lot less fun. In this GOTM, I ventured so far as to have 1 or 2 empty former Roman towns while still at war with Rome, but this was probably just because I knew that I would be able to take them out very quickly even with the odd flip (which did not occur).<br />

I keep one MP in a captured town just until it is out of resistance, but only because I want to be able to rush stuff in it, including settlers, and you can't rush while in resistance, and you can't end resistance if you have no MPs.<br />
<br />
Flips are an opportunity, not a problem. I always starve and/or settler/worker rush a captured city down to one foreigner. If a captured city flips and I retake it that's one less foreign pop point I have to worry about. I try to ensure that I have at least one attacker within range of any city susceptible to flips so that I can recapture it immediately. But if my offensive is running short of units I have little hesitation in moving such units into the front line temporarily. Moving the front line forward takes top priority.</div></div><hr />

I learned the hard way on this GoTM how hurtful a town flip with 8 healing cav's can be.  I will follow this advice for now on, though I think it's important to note that the towns don't flip on the 1st turn of occupation.  Therefore, you can place a lot of injured units in the town to quell resistance as much as possible.  After the 1st turn, I will now resolve myself to move everyone out except 1 unit.<br />

Yes, 3 turns is the cut off point. I never let my units for further. Besides, I have noticed, that leaving any unit after that point, the target is readier to flip. Seems like no garrison at all vs. small or one garrison is better.</div></div><hr />

In the end of domination, I tend to disband my military units to get settlers rushed in those resisting towns.<br />

If I have enough of units, I'll proceed until my force is downing. Then I'm likely to disband healing units for settler production. That'll net me a few turns earlier Domination. You can still rush build by disbanding units in resisting towns.</div></div><hr />

IIRC, 1 cav = 25 shields, 1 knight/elephant = 20 shields.  So, 3 elephants = 4 people (2 settlers).  Probably the ones that eat the most  :D</div></div><hr />

Not true. It appears you are safe on the turn you capture a town, but you are definitely liable to flips after this. It is not safe to wait for units to heal in a captured town, even if it has barracks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Flip Calculation:<br />
<br />
The full formula (this is from Sorenson, who is responsible for this programming):<br />
<br />
P=[(F+T)*Cc*H*(Cte/Cty) - G]/D<br />
<br />
where:<br />
P = probability that it will flip this turn<br />
F = # foreignors, with resistors counting double<br />
T = # working tiles under foreign control (out of the max of 21, no matter what the cultural boundaries are atm)<br />
Cc = 2 if foreign civ has more local culture than you, 1 otherwise<br />
H = .5 for WLTKD, 2 for disorder, 1 otherwise<br />
Cte = Total culture of the foreign civ<br />
Cty = Total culture of your civ<br />
G = # garrison units<br />
D = factor based on relative distance to capitals&quot;<br />
<br />
My analysis:<br />
<br />
You'll see that the first multiplier is specified as (F+T). F is zero in a city you founded (and didn't join any foreign workers) and you aren't working any of the tiles in the AI's 21 tile radius, then T is zero then we can ignore the rest of the parameters as we have zero flip probability. And the calculation evaluation takes place after the production phase of your turn and before your first unit can move, so you can't lose the city the turn you take it, but any succeeding turn until all of the citizens are converted or the AI is eliminated, the flip is possible. One overriding factor, the capital city cannot flip (FP or other wonders do not have any bearing).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks!  :)  I thought I read somewhere that 1 turn was the max.  Therefore, the stratagy of getting the # of units = # of resistors for the turn during capture is correct.  I just need to remember to keep the wounded units out after that.  Though, it is very tempting just to let them rest 1 more turn in a captured city with a barracks as this gets them to 100% health.  Therefore, I will now tatoo the names of my 8 lost cavalry in my brain so I won't forget and fall to this temptation. :scan:</div></div><hr />

Putting multiple units in can only reduce resistance, but from a healing point of view you are better off leaving them outside the city. Even if the city has a barracks they won't heal on the capture turn, when they move into it, and if you have to move them out again on the next move after capture you'll lose a healing turn. Usually I'd rather get units healed fast than reduce resistance a bit faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe it does, but not a couple, just 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mad-bax</div><div class="date">Feb 21, 2004, 04:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed. It gets one unit of the type with the strongest defensive value the civ is capable of making.<br />
<br />
What I don't know is if the unit will be a vet if the town has a rax. :hmm:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grotius</div><div class="date">Feb 22, 2004, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So does the flipped town also get the use of my former garrison units, or are they completely wiped out, and just replaced by the one strong defensive unit?<br />
<br />
If the flipped town just gets one defensive unit, that's not such a big deal to retake.  I hadn't realized it was only one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Offa</div><div class="date">Feb 22, 2004, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It isn't necessarily only one unit. Bigger cities can get two defenders (?always). If you are really paranoid about flips then cut off all resources from a captured city from the enemy and then the new defenders will just be spearmen (unless they have reached nationalism...).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">civ_steve</div><div class="date">Feb 23, 2004, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally qualified for this thread (busy month in RL), so I thought I'd throw out some comments first:<br />
<br />
Flips:  to answer Grotius' questions, your defenders are eliminated when a city you own flips to another civ.  The civ it flips to gets a base defender (if you gift a town to some other civ, it gets a base defender also); I don't recall seeing large cities getting 2 defenders if it flips, but I can't be certain: most large cities I take over get small fast :)  (I usually form enough entertainers that all working citizens are Happy; this causes rapid starvation).  On two occasions, I've had a city flip away from me TWICE!!, and on both occasions it got 2 base defenders on the second flip, and I'm pretty sure both cities were size 6 or smaller.<br />
<br />
Healing: putting a wounded unit in a city (without a barracks) to heal only benefits you if the unit is a 1 hp Elite unit!  A city with a barracks heals a unit faster if it has 3 or 4 hit points against it.  So, heal in place unless you're at risk of losing the unit.  If the unit has more movement points on the turn it got damaged, it does make sense to move it to a city.  Also, I don't think movement by Rails counts against healing, so if you can railroad-move a unit back to a healing city you will also heal that turn (IIRC)<br />
<br />
Disbanding: you get 1/4 of the unit's shield cost, rounded down, in reclaimed shields for the city's current production.  So a Cav is worth 20 shields and a War Elephant is worth 17 shields.  (Or, in other words, a Settler is worth 2 War Elephants, or a Cavalry and Longbowman!)  Also, you can combine Disbanding with Rushing (if there is no resistance) to get 1 turn production without the big cost that rushing alone would incur (8x if no shield accumulation vs 4x if there is at least 1 shield in production bin).<br />
<br />
SirPleb's game: Wow!  So, to recap, research quickly to Republic, then to Chivalry, get Golden Age going, and trample everything in your way!  Very nice!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's my quick post:<br />
<br />
I entered the Middle Ages in 30AD; I'd already taken Persepolis (and the Pyramids), and declared peace with Persia leaving Xerxes about 5-6 cities.  I had contact with Carthage (who built the Great Lighthouse), and my hastily rushed galleys had already found the safe transit spot to the West, and contacted Rome.<br />
<br />
Two of the first level Medieval Techs were already known (Mono and Engineering, I believe), so I researched Feudalism as quick as possible, and was able to trade for the other two.  I researched Theology quickly also , then started a slow 40 turn research on Education.  By this time a suicide galley had successfully gone East, and I had gained all contacts.  Greece had the Great Library, and Carthage was the other good researcher.  Everyone else was at least a step or two behind, and Babylon was being dismembered.<br />
<br />
Peace with Persia lasted 20 turns, then it was bash some more on Xerxes time!  I went fairly slowly, as I was trying to get a GL to rush a palace in Persepolis (I'd already built the FP near Delhi).  No luck, so I finally did in Xerxes in 560 AD,  and with some set-up I abandoned Delhi and Jumped the palace to Persepolis.  I revolted that same turn, and had a new palace and a new Republic government in 570 AD.  About Time!  The maintenance on those cultural buildings was starting to mount up!<br />
<br />
My goal was a 100K culture victory, so I crammed a city in nearly every spot possible on the continent.  I ended up with 43 cities; with slightly better placing 2 or 3 more might have been possible, but I'll move forward with this set.  I was pop-rushing Temples, Libraries and Cathedrals at every oppurtunity; once I was Republic the populace could breathe a little easier.<br />
<br />
So I started a bunch of wars, and used Techs to get allies; my goal was to slow down Carthage and Greece, and the Romans, Germans and Ottomans were happy to help!  I finally got Education, well after the leaders, but was able to trade for Invention, and I got Chivalry as part of an alliance deal.  Then I kicked up the research to learn Astronomy.  Started to build some War Elephants, with the intention of landing just enough inside Carthage to get a Victory and start my Golden Age and build lots of universities.  What do you know?   Carthage lands a single Longbowman on my continent!  :lol:  I put two defenders in the adjacent cities, making sure they were unfortified, and moved a War Elephant up.  Fortunately the Longbowman won (1 hp left), and my WE finished him off, starting my GA without having to do an invasion.  This was in 860 AD.<br />
<br />
I pretty much did maximum research from that point on.  I traded for Gunpowder, Chemistry and Metallurgy, and researched Banking, Navigation, Physics, Magnetism and Theory of Gravity, reaching the Industrial Age in 1080 AD (just after the GA expired.)  I've kept the rest of the world pretty riled up; Greece and Carthage are a bit beat up, and the Celts are now even with them.  I have exclusive knowledge of Physics, and of course TofG and Magnetism, and I'm missing Democracy and Military Tradition.  My Cultural Value is just over 23,000, gaining 500 cpt.  I figure I should achieve the 100K victory in the mid-1700's or so.<br />
<br />
BTW, a 3rd source of Iron has shown up in my Territory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have &quot;crammed&quot; one of my fasted GOTMs, both in RL and game time, over the past few days, and will post a more detailed report tomorrow.  I was actually quite excited about my early domination victory, only to see SirPleb (as expected) beat me by nearly 200 years.  I already knew a couple mistakes I made, I built a couple stacks of cats/cannons that never made it to the front, and struggled short of cash so I could get to Cavalry, when Elephants would have won it with more temples rushed earlier.  Anyway, here is the victory screen, until I can post the rest of the report tomorrow:<br />

You may be comparing with SirPleb, but you beat my domination date by a country mile. I look forward to seeing your write-up, as I also finished with Cavalry.

<br />
The Rest of the Story<br />
The rest of this game seemed destined to prove the old saying, Knowledge is Power.  In my Ancient Ages post, I referred to my anonymous friends, which I had made with the help of the Great Lighthouse.  The Lighthouse completed in 950BC, and I (with the help of the whip) I had 3 galleys ready to go.  Two headed east, one west, and two turns later, the one to the west made contact with Carthage.  I could see a red border, so I held off on trading for another turn until I met Rome.  Both had Iron working, Carthage had Math but was short Polytheism, and Rome had Code of Laws and Horseback, while short Mysticism!  So in 875BC I traded Carthage Polytheism for Mathematics, Iron Working and 10g, and traded Rome Mysticism for 35g, then Polytheism + Math for Code of Laws, Horseback Riding and another 35g.  Just in time, as Persia had declared on me in 1000BC, only to discover I have no iron either!  But Persia does, I had already seen a regular Immortal by now.  Still, Catapults would help, and now I knew where to go pillage.  <br />
<br />
My ships in the east had poked around a bit, then hopped from sea tile to sea tile and saw an orange border on an island.  I met the Ottomans in 800BC who were down Poly, then Germany in 750, Babylon in 730, Vikings in 690, Celts in 630 and finally the [/b]Greeks[/b] in 610BC.  Everyone was short Poly, and all but the Greeks were also missing Math and Code of Laws.  Vikings and Celts were really backwards, and didn’t even have Map-Making yet.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, in 670BC the Ottomans discovered Construction, and Rome has Philosophy.  Time for a 2-fer.  I buy Philosophy for 13gpt from Rome, then trade Philo, Poly, and 10gpt to the Ottomans for [/b]Construction[/b].  Unfortunately I am still paying monopoly prices, but I am still able to resell at monopoly because they don’t know the other civs yet.  I started a minimum research on Monarchy, hoping Currency would pop up soon (I don’t know why, after the past few games, I still hope the AI will research the last tech in the era, it never works, whichever tech I need :(  ).  <br />
<br />
Back to the front lines, I described in the AA post how I eventually conquered Persepolis (and the Pyramids) and took Monarchy for peace, so I could then research Literature, and finally Currency to get to the Middle Ages in 330BC.  Since I had made all contacts by now, it was time to play a little Tech Lotto and see what my supposedly scientific friends could do for me:<br />
Civ            Getting them to MA     Free Tech       Missing<br />
Ottomans   Currency for 130, 1gpt   Feudalism  (Had Monarchy, -Lit)<br />
Greeks       Currency for 28g (Gave Const.) Feudalism (Missing Lit, Monarchy)<br />
Germans     Currency for 73g           Engineering :)  (Missiong Lit, Monarchy) <br />
Babylons    Currency for 8g             NOT Scientific :( (again!)<br />
Persia          Currency for 14g           Feudalism  (Have Lit and Monarchy).<br />
<br />
I hated to trade with Persia, as I didn’t want them to get Feudalism/Pikes, but I wanted another shot at Monotheism.  I gave this situation some thought.  I have already seen how my knowledge of the other civs has given me power, now it was time to take advantage of their lack of knowledge!  After buying an embassy to verify, Persia had no knowledge of any other civs.  No one else had made it to our continent, and after studying the sea lanes, there looked to be only one path for a non-lighthouse or non-seafaring civ to make it across, from Rome/Carthage.  I also reviewed the civilopedia, looking at every tech to see if they made special ships available (AKA the Odan junk at Monotheism last game), but nothing out of the ordinary.  Therefore, as long as I parked a ship on that sea lane, no one would ever hear Xerxes scream.  <br />
<br />
Map of Sea Lane <br />

<br />
(Note the wounded barb galley, apparently someone had tried to make contact, or Persia had a galley, but didn’t survive!)<br />
<br />
The Fall of Xerxes<br />
So, now we pick up our story again, it’s 330BC, dawn of the Middle Ages.  When I got the embassy, I also saw that Pasargadea was working on Hanging Gardens, due in 19 (same as me) and did not have their Iron city connected to the capital!  Although it was connected to two other cities, through MY roads!  But, after splurging a little more (knowledge is power!) and investigating, the cities with iron had no barracks, so no upgrades.  Average of 2 spear garrison each.  Time to pay Xerxes a visit.  I buy Feudalism and an ROP for Literature and 15gpt.  (I don’t like ROP rapes, but in this case I am going to take advantage of the lack of contacts, and I don’t want him whipping any pikes, since I still have archers).  Trade with Germany, getting Engineering for Lit, Monarchy, Feudalism, and 6gpt (They would have gotten those techs from other civs anyway).  Sell Rome Literature for 72g.  Move troops (2 stacks of 4 archer, 2 spear each, and 5 cats total) adjacent to Antioch (Iron city) and Bactra.  I also move 4 warriors into Persepolis, which rushes a barracks.  Declare war, lose 2 archers but take both cities (including the iron), killing 4 spears and an archer.  Two more archers moving in the open, but I have reinforcements en route.  Upgrade the warriors for 4 Med. Infantry.  (Never had a swordsman).  Stack with Cats moves next to Arbela, 2 archers kill 2 spear, and it’s mine also.  It takes a few more turns, but Pasargadae falls in 190BC, then Sidon in 150, and finally Persia is eliminated in 50BC, and no one will ever know they existed.<br />
<br />
Dealing with Rome<br />
Meanwhile, across the channel, Rome destroys Carthage in 210BC.  I wasn’t quite prepared, but reacted quickly, and landed a settler to found Dacca in 130BC, securing Furs and Horses!  A rushed library and harbor later, and I was in business.  I get another bonus in 50BC, when Rome develops the Republic, but still lack Currency or Construction.  I debate whether I even want it, but decide it would be good to have the improved corruption before my imminent Golden Age.  So I trade Construction, Currency, Ivory, Wool, and Spices (like I could trade them to anyone else) for Republic, an ROP, (uh oh), and Furs (I roaded the horses first, furs were still 10 turns away).  I am then able to sell Republic to Germany for 140g+22gpt, and the Ottomans for 47g+7gpt, because, after all, Knowledge is Power, and they had no knowledge of Rome either.  Besides, I also wanted to force them to research into the MA, not waste time on Republic.  <br />
<br />
An Optimized Golden Age<br />
Probably because this was a ‘scheduled’ Golden Age, I took more time than usual to prepare for it, making sure I would get maximum benefit.  By now nearly every tile in my original empire was irrigated or mined, and roaded.  I had 25+ workers running around, continuing to improve Persian tiles.  I rushed 3 more settlers from Persian towns to fill in their cities a little denser, so they could get Temples during the GA.  In 30BC, I revolted to Republic, both for the gold bonus, and for the corruption benefit.  As it turned out, there wasn’t much net benefit after all, as my unit support outgrew my income, but when I calculated it out, I was still coming out ahead by a little over 30gpt.  10AD was my final pre-GA turn, double checking everything was in place, and 30AD the Golden Age kicks off, as I complete the Hanging Gardens.  Forbidden Palace also completes the same turn in Madras (Central Mountains), I wanted that in place as well for the corruption benefit.  We see a big boost in income, of course.  I had 27 cities, and focused initially on completing infrastructure (Libraries/Markets where needed), and started research on Monotheism, due in 5. <br />
<br />
I also worked to optimize production for horses.  By 150AD Delhi was at 30spt, with Bombay a few turns later, and several other cities at 15spt.  <br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads6/GOTM28_250AD_F1.jpg <br />
<br />
I got Monotheism in 110AD, started now on Invention (due in 5), I didn’t want to get Chivalry until I was done building horses.  I wait a couple turns, then sell to my trading partners, getting 100+33gpt from the Ottomans and 90+23gpt from Germany.  Invention comes in 250AD, and I get 80+48g from the Ottomans and 100+9gpt from the Germans.  I will need a lot of cash soon.  I upgrade my 4 remaining vet archers.  Celts complete Great Library, which they needed, as they are a backwards people.  290AD I get Gunpowder (Gotta love 4-turn research in the Middle Ages!).  I switch to Chivalry, but back off the pace, dragging it out to 6 turns.  Good news is we have Saltpeter.  GA ends in 330, and Leo’s is still due in 6, I didn’t time that pre-build well enough, so I have to wait a few more turns.  <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I notice another opportunity knocking.  One of my scouting galleys notes the Vikings are down to OCC, and the Celts are moving in for the kill.  Rush a settler and another galley, and head over the sea, then wait for the Celt MDIs to finish the job, and we have a foothold on their continent in 390AD.  :D<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads6/GOTM28_CeltVike.jpg <br />
<br />
I also settle Wine Island in 330AD, but by now I don’t think the game will last long enough to use it.  In fact, at this point (in RL) I realized that there weren’t enough days left in the month for the 100K Cultural, and I would be pushing it to get a victory at all by the 29th, as we had family in town.  Domination looked like the quickest way to get a win, and I thought I could get a pretty good date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
420AD Chemistry comes in, and Leo’s completes.  Celts also complete Sun Tzu.  Time to use all that cash:<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads6/J2_G28_Upgrade.jpg <br />
<br />
These 40 are just on the Roman continent, I have 17 more on galleys headed to our Celtic colony.  A big advantage for the Elephants is that I can upgrade on the Celt continent, even though we don’t have Ocean trade yet!  Since Rome is still isolated, I position MDI’s to pillage all 4 iron sources, and move my elephants (5 stacks of 8) adjacent to his cities, with a stack of cats to help at Antium.  I will save Rome to unite a couple stacks against.  War is declared in 440AD, and I take 6 cities, as well as all the iron, and several legions and archers in the open.  I only have 2 elite archers, so my focus now is to get some elite elephants, I still want to rush my palace over here.  Rome itself falls in 480AD, Veii was the final Roman city and fell in 530AD after some unsuccessful attempts to get a leader.  <br />
<br />
Half a world away, but in parallel, I upgrade 17 horses to elephants and declare (honorably) on the Celts in 450AD.  After taking Nidaros (Colossus), I start working my way south, toward Entremont with the G. Library and Sun Tzu.  Research was progressing on Metallurgy, since my catapults were not that effective, but also so I could get Cav to speed up the rest of my war machine.  <br />
<br />
In 490BC, I was running low on cash, and decided to cell Chivalry to some of the other AI, getting a total of 200g+85gpt, and revolted back to Monarchy.  My WW was forcing my lux slider up, and unit support was over 160gpt.  (More on that later).  Entremont fell in 520AD, giving me Sun Tzu and Great Library (which eventually gave me Theology, but never got to Education).  In 530 Metallurgy was discovered, and I started on Military Tradition (in 7).  I had workers roading a salt mountain in former Celtic lands, and planned on upgrading all my cats to cannons to support my elephants.  (Note to self- Cannons take Salt AND IRON!).  Well, delay that order for a while.  I pushed on with elephants and took Richborough, which had Iron, and by 600AD, Military Tradition came in, and I was able to upgrade a few cav and some cannons to finish off the Celts by 630AD.  <br />
<br />
This was a time of great sea movements, as I started transferring my cavs and elite elephants to Babylon, while I had upgraded over 20 cav and 12 cannons from Rome, and used a fleet of galleys to sail from sea to sea to get to Germany.  I kept my ROP with Germany, and positioned to strike, declaring on Babylon in 640AD, reducing them to an island city by 670, and did the same to Germany, declaring in 650AD, and reducing them to 1 city by 680.  I was at 854 tiles of 1012, so I needed more land.  Meanwhile, I was struggling to rush temples and settlers in Rome and Celt lands, but I was only able to do 3-4/turn (income around 300gpt).  Getting impatient, I also declared on the Ottomans in 690, taking all their cities (except an island) in 700AD.  That proved to be enough, combined with border expansions, and in 710AD I passed the limit.  My Firaxis score was 6771.   My power graph:<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads6/J2_G28_Power.jpg <br />
<br />
You can see from the mini-map, Greece was the only untouched country, the others were reduced to their one-city islands.  <br />
<br />
Lessons Learned<br />
I learned a lot from this game, some of which was, um, reinforced after reading SirPleb’s excellent writeup.  First, and probably my biggest stumbling block, is I must decide early what victory condition I am going for, and then focus on that.  I was still building libraries and cathedrals while invading Rome (holdovers from my 100K culture plan).  I was also looking to settle more small towns, for the same reason.  Even once I decided on Domination, I should have concentrated on more galleys, and settlers, to fill in gaps, so they were ready to go with the troops, instead of scrambling to rush them afterwards.  Temples have to be rushed, but I could easily have had the settlers available.  Also, knowing I would need to rush temples later, I should have stockpiled more cash.  Also, I wasted production in cities building markets, aqueducts, harbors, etc that would never finish before the end of the game, they should have switched at least to wealth.  I also had tons of workers roaming around Rome, improving tiles that were always to be corrupt, and many were native (i.e. I was paying support on them :crazyeye: )  I finally started merging some in toward the end, but much later than I should have.<br />
<br />
Second, when going for a fast-moving domination, cannons and especially catapults are not worth the effort.  I invested production, transport space, upgrade gold, and especially unit support, on 25+ cannons that didn’t see action after the Celts fell.  And in several cases, I delayed attacks to get them in place, only to save 1-2 hp from defenders.  That’s 50gpt in unit support (plus another 10 or so extra galleys built to carry them), and 500g in upgrades, for no real benefit.  For those shields, I could have had 7 extra elephants, or 16 settlers with me on the initial assault waves.  And that’s not even considering the research cost of getting to Metallurgy, which brings me to point #3.<br />
<br />
Third, Elephants were obviously effective enough to win this game.  I had all but destroyed the Celts, and the Romans were long gone, before Cavalry was on the scene.  Had I invested all that research money into temples and settlers, I might have already expanded enough to hit the limit, or be close.  The opportunity cost was well over 6,000 gold in research, which could have been shut off in 350AD with Chivalry.  I could have easily rushed 20 elephants in front-line cities with that, which certainly would have been enough to finish the job.  <br />
<br />
Fourth, SirPleb did some excellent analysis of the benefits of Republic vs. Monarchy.  My own experience mostly supports his conclusions.  At the time I first switched to Republic, I did have to increase lux 10%, because I had been using some MPs to balance out my largest cities, and unit support was a little high, but still a net gain of 30gpt.  (I was a little disappointed that there seemed to be no effect on corruption, I thought Republic was supposed to be better).  Even with higher lux during WW, Republic seemed at worst to break even with Monarchy, meaning I would be ahead during all peaceful times.  However, by the end of my game, unit support was going up faster than I was taking cities, and WW was going up as I dragged out the Roman war searching for leaders, so I switched back.  Had I not been religious, though, I would have gone Republic and rode it out.  <br />
<br />
Final point regards leaders.  I know SirPleb’s leader article cautions about planning on a leader when you need it, and I stayed pretty flexible about it, knowing I had few elites (2 archers) when I started my campaign.  My plan for the first leader was to rush a palace in Rome, since I had already build the FP in the center of my starting continent.  But when that wasn’t forthcoming, even as I accumulated 10-12 elite elephants, I figured I could also get some use out of a palace in Entremont, securing Sun Tzu and the Library and generally suppressing flips in the new continent.  However, for the first game I can remember in a long time, I got ZERO great leaders.  In a Domination win!  Luckily, none of my plans DEPENDED on it, although it meant I went the entire game with only one and a half cores.  Well, at least that fits with the Conquests transition, right? ;)<br />
<br />
Oh, one final lesson learned: Don't put off the GOTM till the end of the month!  Especially in February!!! ;)</div></div><hr />
