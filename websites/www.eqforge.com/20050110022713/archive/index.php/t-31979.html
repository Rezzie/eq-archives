<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mchorlton</div><div class="date">Sep 12, 2002, 07:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">is there an e-mail virus going around with the subject line 'Ellie's Birthday Photos'.  <br />
<br />
I have deleted this message without looking at it since i do not know the person who sent or and i don't know anyone called Ellie.  It worries me though that the e-mail address that sent the mail was from someone called Ann Chorlton - Chorlton is my family name, but i do not know this person.<br />
<br />
I have norton antivirus which scans my e-mails as they download, but it did not stop this mail.<br />
<br />
Any info?</div></div><hr />

What e-mail program are you using?  If it is outlook, you should be able to set the security settings to &quot;high&quot;, in which case outlook won't execute any scripts in the e-mail if you view it.<br />
<br />
You can probably open the e-mail text all-right, but just be careful about viewing attachments.  Look at the name of the attachment - if its something like &quot;photo.jpg&quot; or &quot;photo.bmp&quot; then it will be OK.<br />
<br />
If its &quot;Photo.bmp.EXE&quot; or &quot;Photo.jpg.com&quot;  (ie has an extension ending in say .com or .exe), then DON'T open the extension.<br />
<br />
It may be something simple (and innocent) like someone getting the e-mail address slightly wrong - eg sent it to m.chorlton instead of mchorlton for example. :)</div></div><hr />

i do have the latest virus defs.  so i suppose it wasn't.  i use Outlook Express, so i don't suppose the security features are as good, but i don't want to use Outlook.<br />
<br />
i got cencerned becaus i'm VERY careful about who i give my e-mail address to.  i rarely ever get any spam.  so i suppose it was a mistyped address.    But still best to be on the safe side i think!</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have TOO much faith in Norton. ;)<br />
<br />
Norton is probably 3rd or 4th for best virus scanners.  Plus...NO program will pick up EVERY virus.<br />
<br />
I could write a virus today...and start spreading.  They have to catch it, disect it, find a way to identify it, and find a way to stop it.  This can take weeks.<br />
<br />
Anyway...It'S ALWAYS a good idea to delete mail if you don't know where it came from.  I've gotten two e-mail in the last two days.  One with a .eml attachment and one with a .bmp.pif attachment.  The .bmp.pif is a popular one.  most people don't see the .pif part because they have extentions turned off. So they think it's a picture...double click it....and are now infected.<br />
<br />
I don't use any real-time virus scanning, except common sense.  If I do suspect a virus, I go to http://housecall.antivirus.com and run a complete scan.  I normally have a bunch from websites...like JS.NOCLOSE and harmless ones like that.  But nothing major so far. :D</div></div><hr />
