<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2003, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As has recently been discussed, having the Statue of Liberty (SOL) simplifies the upcoming military operations against the Zulus. We need to revolt at the start of the operations because we currently are a democracy and the senate would immediately sign a peace treaty with the Zulus. We want to avoid anarchy and having SOL means that timing the revolution is not constrained by oedo years. It also means more flexibility in the number of 'non-democracy' years. Without SOL we must either finish the military operations in two turns (difficult and requires a large army) or stay in monarchy for several turns (from one oedo year to the next one). SOL means more flexibility here and we can also choose a far better government than monarchy (fundamentalism or communism).<br />
<br />
The SOL drawbacks are its cost. We would buy it (using caravans takes too much time) since we can easily make more than $1000 per turn meaning that we can easily afford this. The cost is 1,5-2 turns of maximum taxes.<br />
<br />
The Ministry of Domestic Affairs strongly recommends building the SOL and preventing the AI from getting it is also nice.</div></div><hr />
