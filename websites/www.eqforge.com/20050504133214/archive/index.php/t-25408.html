<br />
I've gotten to 500AD, I know where the 3 of the Civs are and who one of the other 3 is (he built a couple of wonders), but I have no idea where they are.  I know the other 3 are on a differrent continent since I have traded maps with my neighbors and know the complete layout of my own continent. It might be another 200-500 years (or more) before someone comes calling. Since no one has built the Lighthouse yet, there seems to be no interest in leaving the home continent.<br />
<br />
I'd also like to throw my 2 cents into the massive barbarians discussion. I had 5 stacks appear in the same turn, results: 2 sacked cities, 4 spearmen/3 warriors dead, about 50 gold gone, 7 citizens slaughtered and 3 city improvements destroyed. I glad most of the land is spoken for and there shouldn't be many more visits from those stinking bandits!!:D</div></div><hr />

I will read the spoilers thread when my game is &quot;finished&quot; but not actually over, if you know what I mean. In other words, once I hit the point where victory is assured and everything else is a matter of mop-up operations. I would say that you are not at this point yet from what you say in your game; it would probably be premature for you to read through the thread now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">denyd</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2002, 05:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Last night a couple of turns in, India went bye-bye and a green Galley showed up on my northeaet coast. Japan had come for a visit, a couple of deals later and I had acquired world maps from Japan and China. <br />
<br />
It's now 700AD and I can finally take a look how everyone else is doing.<br />
<br />
I don't know where the rest of you find all the time to play. I'm only able to squeeze the 10:30-midnight time slot in each day.</div></div><hr />
