I don't have any idea of the distribution over there. Espcially if your looking for it in a specific language.<br />
<br />
I've never played TOT but i've seen it plenty of the game it looks all right but i don't think your missing too much.<br />

anything else? And what is GoTM and Test of Time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Circee</div><div class="date">Mar 03, 2001, 11:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'll try to explain what Test of time is.<br />
The PATCH test of time let you play on much bigger map and with much more gold.<br />
Civilization ToT is a version that let you play on three wolrlds differents, with bnew graphivcs etc... I never play it. just seen some pub, so.<br />
<br />
GoTM is the Game of The month, you can have all the specification in the GOTM forum and in the Game of the month section of the site, here: www.civfanatics.com/civ2gotm.shtml (http://www.civfanatics.com/civ2gotm.shtml) <br />

It's being pulled from shelves.<br />
If you do have, best take care of your disc.<br />
Civ 3 maybe before Christmas, given the current actions?<br />

The other two with I have not purchase or examine has it packaged (each)with two other games, &amp; probably does not contain a printed manual.<br />
For playing FW &amp; CIC scenarios single player, civ2classic is preferable, the MGE AI attitude fouls up some of the scenarios.  For multiplayer, MGE is the clear standout.<br />
I have not seen FW  on disk available anywhere.  MGE &amp; TOT a available mew, off &amp; on, at various E-tailers, civ, civ2, civ2MGE, &amp; civ2ToT, are available used at switchhouse.com, a sale trade matching service, but I do not know if any of them ship outside North America.<br />
