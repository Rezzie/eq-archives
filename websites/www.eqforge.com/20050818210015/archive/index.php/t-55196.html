If we destroy it and settle one tile NW instead. Thaats a much better place to settle. Ww will have 4 less over lapped tiles if we do this. I know it may seem unnecessrry but it will improve our city planning and the usefullness of our citys..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2003, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well El-Amarna will probably be auto-razed anyway as our troops are close and it is only pop size 1, which I have no problem with. The Egyptian city is in a bad spot, but I would move it one tile to the NE, where it would be a port city. Is that what you meant too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2003, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh Im sorry I just wrote it wrong. I ofcourse ment one tile NE. Thx for the corecction. The City might grow before we get get it... I know that it might not but this is just a what if situation so that we dont need to raze it when weve had it for several turns...</div></div><hr />

That means that at least 2 cities have to be lost by the villain who destroyed our settler. I prefer capturing Egyptian cities but I'm also satisfied with razing. <br />

Let's turn the Egyptians into mummy's !!!</div></div><hr />

Why give them a royal burial? I say throw em in a ditch ;)<br />
<br />
RAZE EL-ARMANA!!!!!!! :hammer: :hammer: :hammer:</div></div><hr />

I'm willing to give them a royal burial if that's needed to get rid of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Razing a city now means Egypt will hate us for the rest of eternity. We aren't ready to wipe Egypt off the face of the earth in one fast war yet (or at least most in the poll on our wars goals said not)... don't we want to be careful to have SOME chance of being able to settle things down again after this war?<br />
<br />
I tend to believe in civilzed war with no razes... its not THAT hard to avoid a size-1 city while attacking somewhere else, and there isn't too much risk involved from a city with no culture and low production doing us any harm.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's in an inconvenient location. (So is one of our cities, if you ask me, but there was a survey on that, at least.) Easy enough to capture it and if need be move it later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2003, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Um, with the way I have been handling settlers lately, I say we should keep the city that's there.  :D<br />
<br />
Please consider that to even take El-Amarna with certainty, we would probably need to use our Legions and you know what that means, right?<br />
<br />
We talk a good game, but are we ready to walk the walk all the way into Thebes?  Or at least to Byblos?  This would mean using our mighty Legions while we enjoy our not-so-great Golden Age.  And that would be fine with me.<br />
<br />
I will be posting an official, final poll on our GA shortly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2003, 12:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If we are going to move the city, it need to be done at the ecsact moment that we get it. The egyptans will be much angreier (so will our people) if we raza it later..<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW: I dont get it. I tought the GA was a good thing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2003, 02:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@ Sir John. The GA is a good thing. At least normally. Some people in Fanatica think having the GA in the Ancient Age is a waste of time. Although it would be much more productive for us in the Middle or Industrial Age, our Unique Unit is ready to win a battle now. It would even be better if we were in a Monarchy or Republic to capitalize on some bonus commerce, but again no. <br />
<br />
The discussion for the last couple of weeks has centered on holding back our Legionaries in hopes of doing the same with our Golden Age. But I now feel the time has come to let loose the dogs of war on Egypt, and this act will surely bring on our GA with a Legionary's victory. <br />
<br />
Let's bring it on. We'll need this little GA to finance our Legionaries and get our nation back on track in the world of production. We will be able to produce Settlers and a strong Military, as well as hold our heads high in the human race because we will not be bogged down in the quest for each. At least until the GA ends ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2003, 05:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let historians be able to call this age, when they look back, as the Golden Age of Fanatica when the part of the nation called &quot;new Egypt&quot; was added to the Empire while simultaniously the empire expanded westwards and the Great Library were build.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2003, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I perferibly that we do not raise any city unless it is a Deadbeat City.</div></div><hr />
