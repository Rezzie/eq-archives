<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Mar 05, 2002, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mogon sent his game quite late, but he got this award. If you didn't submitted I would have it. :eek: If that was the case I'd be in a far better position to state that I find that award meaningless. But of course it's always up to you to decide. :)<br />
<br />
Hence this poll. It's been a discussion before, but I got persuaded, to do you (plurity) a favour. But I wonder if that was the case.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my opinion: a histographic victory means a failure of all other types of victories. If you go for a histographic victory, you do that because you can't another one. That will always give you more points namely. And going for a histographic victory because you get an award then is agruing the other way around. :)<br />
<br />
What do you think?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mogon</div><div class="date">Mar 06, 2002, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Conquest or space race were also possible ... :D<br />
But retirement victory was the best choice, i tought that i had the highest probability of getting an award, and according to the results i was right, wasn't i ? :rolleyes: <br />
The main problem in CIV 3 is that milking gives more points than middle/late conquest, i hate milking but this is a contest. Maybe, we could find another way to evaluate each player's performance. For example, we could had to the score a bonus based on the date of retirement. But, this seems to be another poll, i'm going to check it.<br />
Congratulations to Eman (ealy conquest 590 AD), i could retry one billion times, i would not be able to get such a score. :mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my opinion a histographic victory means that you have been able to stop the AI from winning. <br />
<br />
If you have got a bad starting position (like this time:mad: ) and have been unlucky in your first fights you will be doomed to lack in score compared to others. A histographic victory award gives some players (including me) a goal to go for even if things are going worse.<br />
<br />
So please keep it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChumChum</div><div class="date">Mar 06, 2002, 06:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i don't think the question is whether to keep histographic victory as a viable win, rather it is whether to give out an award for the highest histo win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirPleb</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2002, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted to keep it. I think it is good to have more goals to shoot for.<br />
<br />
Maybe this ought to be yet another poll :) : I think it would be cool to add another medal, for highest score loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2002, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then we'd just get games like my HOF submission SirPleb! ;)  Of course maybe that was what you meant, just give all us milkers one more icon to shoot for.</div></div><hr />

You're right, I'm afraid that's exactly what I meant. I replied on this thread before seeing the other poll. When I replied here I was in I-want-more-icons-beside-my-name mode. :lol: I'm glad you understand that one! :)<br />
<br />
On reading the other thread I considered what I was doing a bit more. I.e. milking toward a cultural win because I don't have the nice note icon yet. (I did however try to finish a bit more in the style to match the win, letting the other Civs live for a change ;))  Doesn't seem quite right after all, what you propose makes more sense to me. Which in most GOTMs will mean histographic == high score trophy, so histographic is not required at all.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see a lowest score win medal</div></div><hr />
