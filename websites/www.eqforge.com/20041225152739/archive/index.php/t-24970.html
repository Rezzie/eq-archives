You get the error message &quot;WinG Load Failure&quot; when trying to start the civ2.exe program:<br />
<br />

<br />
Description<br />
WinG is a older set of drivers and libraries that are necessary to make old versions of Civ2 run.  The files need to be in your \windows\system directory for games that make use of them to run.  The exact filename that is available from MS for free is wing.exe, which is an install program that will copy the necessary files and fix you up.  <br />
<br />
The wing.exe file will install WinG on your system.  I've uploaded it, or you can track it down yourself.  As always, for your own peace of mind, check for virus, but it passed my check and works fine.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Procedure<br />
1.  The zip file (wing1.zip), contains the WinG.exe.  Download it.<br />
<br />
2.  Simply extract the WinG.exe from the wing1.zip :) .  (WinZip, WinAce, and WinRAR are good shareware programs to open .ZIP files)<br />
<br />
3.  Run wing.exe (double click it).  It will want to extract to a directory (I personally prefer an empty one)... <br />
<br />
4.  Execute the file called MSSETUP.EXE (or maybe just MSSETUP).  WinG will install.<br />
<br />
5.  (optional) If you wonder if you have ever had any WinG stuff installed on your machine before, seach your windows OS drive (C:\ most likely) for this:  *wing*  if you get files like wing.dll, or similar stuff, it was installed.  You must decide if you wish to overwrite by re-installing it with the wing.exe installer file.<br />
<br />
6.  All done.  Any game that needs WinG will now operate!<br />
<br />
<br />
Caveats<br />
1.  I have not personally tested this on NT, Win2K, or XP.  I suspect it may not work, because these three OSs are written and compiled completely differently than Win95/98/ME.  Consult the MS Knowledgebase... I do not plan to install it on my W2K.<br />

<br />
You must Unzip it, then run the wing.exe to extract the files, then mun mssetup.exe to install WinG on your machine.<br />
