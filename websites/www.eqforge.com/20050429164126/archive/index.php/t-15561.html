<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saved68</div><div class="date">Feb 01, 2002, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm closing in on the end of GOTM3 (kinda late, I guess, but I didn't find this website until a couple of weeks ago) and I hit a vicious error that keeps shutting me down.  I saw a thread earlier where the trick was to go to the city where the error occurred and make all the workers into entertainers.  It didn't work for me, and I wonder if it's because I still have a resister in that city?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I would appreciate any help you can give.  I would really like to get this game in before the deadline.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

I couldn't be sure exactly which city was causing the crash but increasing the entertainment worked for me.<br />

Looks like the Egyptians are in for some trouble! :)</div></div><hr />

Uncheck that if it seems relevant.</div></div><hr />
