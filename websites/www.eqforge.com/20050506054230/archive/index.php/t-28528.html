<br />
Starting place looks great with furs and rivers nearby and with the difficulty level at regent I think many players will be able to submit a victory this month.<br />
<br />
Good luck to all who play!</div></div><hr />

And I'm happy enough with the normal graphics of Civ3. I've tried Sn00py's graphics mod, but didn't like it. :p</div></div><hr />

My Instruction Manual lists Levels on p. 18-19 as:<br />
Chieftain, Warlord, Prince, Monarch, Emperor, Deity.<br />

Am I correct that Regent is the new name for Monarch?</div></div><hr />

I quess we had to play a low level game eventually, or at least again eventually.  I'm fine with it though.  Just no Chiefton please, ever!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirian</div><div class="date">Aug 03, 2002, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">skaternate: if you've left Regent difficulty behind for keeps in terms of your skill level, and you would only be snoring through and milking this month's GOTM to boost your &quot;global&quot; ranking, there is an alternative. There's a steady diet of challenging scenerios offered at Realms Beyond (http://realmsbeyond.net/civ). There are about three Epics played per month, on average. The next game opens Monday August 5, a Deity conquest scenerio, which might be more entertaining for a player of your experience level.<br />
<br />
Regent games are great for including more players, but some folks have definitely graduated beyond that stage, through more experience. I enjoyed playing GOTM7 but don't intend to play here every month. I pretty much stick to Deity games and/or &quot;variants&quot;. The GOTM offering a Regent game is probably a good thing, as that will be fun for a lot of folks. For those with time for more than one game per month, or in search of a steady supply of rigorous scenerios, there is an alternative.<br />
<br />
Best wishes to all GOTM10 participants.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jove</div><div class="date">Aug 04, 2002, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always wondered if the GOTM maps are screened before they're put up. There always seems to be something unusually cool about them... was Matrix just adept at picking the starting conditions, lucky, or did he choose from among 10 possible games? His last post implies that it's a one-shot, randomly generated map. Now I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Aug 04, 2002, 02:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My computer is so superior it always generates the best maps. :groucho:<br />
<br />
No, seriously: I didn't take a look at the map this time. (I.e. play a few turns.) I did the last two times, but I didn't have to restart then.</div></div><hr />
