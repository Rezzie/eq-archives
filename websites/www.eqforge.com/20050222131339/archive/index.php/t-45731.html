<br />
this poll should by default be non binding.Just to have an idea how people think about it.<br />
<br />
If you vote yes ,you might add wich scenario you would like.<br />
<br />
I voted yes ,i would go for a WWII scenario or the colonies scenario.In any case i would go for a very hard scenario.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zelig</div><div class="date">Feb 25, 2003, 08:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd enjoy having a scenario, preferrably not one with huge amounts of micro-management needed, such as Red Front.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheDuckOfFlanders</div><div class="date">Feb 25, 2003, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">such as Red Front. <br />
<br />
I was thinking of that to ,the thing with this scenario is that it's very hard ,wich is good.And it's more a pure war scenario ,wich could bi a nice change to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">Feb 25, 2003, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a scenario would be excellent and Red Front could be a blast for the military department (would give me alot of work If I were Military Advisor again, but it would be fun).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I voted no. I'd rather we played a fresh game.</div></div><hr />

There is no early simple time to get to know the game.<br />

This is Civ2 fun, not a history forum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you make a good point here though. :( <br />
Guess a scenario demo game is a no-no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kev</div><div class="date">Feb 26, 2003, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will people with Classic Civ2 be able to download and see the game?  I didn't think so unless they used the Cedric patch to MGE.  Don't know what version everyone has either.<br />
<br />
I'm all for a scenario - I suggested doing so in the earlier discussions as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Feb 26, 2003, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All turns are played on the classic version, but can be viewed on MPG. This way everyone can join in and view the savegame, but if you want to be President you need to find the classic version.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much my opinion too:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well ,somebody outside the game with enough knowledge of civII editing could do it.We could ask Smash for example ,or a scenario creator in the civII creation forum.<br />
<br />
But this is a really devided vote ,i don't think it will go trough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Feb 26, 2003, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was the first (and at this point only) abstention, but my post somehow didn't get posted :confused:<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think a scenario would be fun, but brings with it a whole host of extra problems, so I'm a bit ambivelant about it.  If we can make it work, cool, but otherwise, just as cool if we don't :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Feb 27, 2003, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about a real-world game? And with an unusual starting location (like Brazil, Australia...). Of course, we'd know where the civs are and what the land is like.</div></div><hr />
