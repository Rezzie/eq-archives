I understand that advances already discovered have a part in it, but how?  Also, the Civ advances with no pre-requisite sometimes are not available for research.  Why is this?  Or do I just chalk it up to good ol' randomness?  <br />

I just get ticked off when I have everything researched for philosophy and then it ain't available.<br />

It really irritated me when I went for Monarchy having all the advances required but not being able to research it.  I found out a way eventually but never really knew why it happened.  So, thanks to you for posting and Vlad for answering I now know why.  Thanks guys, this will come in use http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif  <br />

<br />
Each tech is assigned a &quot;number&quot; 0,1 or 2.  The number can be determined by listing the techs alphabetically.<br />
<br />
That number fits into a fairly simple formula and if the result is evenly divisible by 3, then techs with that number are unavailable.  (the programmers probably do this with a modulo function.  I haven't tried to convert oedo's formula into a simpler programming algorithm)<br />
<br />
Refer to the  oedo's unfinished  (http://apolyton.net/forums/Forum3/HTML/001533.html)  thread to see the original discussion.**<br />
<br />
There is one exception to the general &quot;xxo&quot; rule...the first tech in alphabetical order (that you have prereqs for) will ALWAYS be available, so Alphabet will never disappear, but Pottery might.  Once you get Alphabet, something like Bronze Working will be available unless you have the prereqs for Astronomy, and so on.<br />
<br />
The count includes techs from Huts traded techs, GL techs and of course &quot;learned&quot; techs.  I think Starting techs do not factor into the equation.<br />
<br />
Oedo has shown that to get to Monarchy you MUST research something &quot;off topic&quot;, or get a tech from somewhere else because Monarchy and it's 2 prereqs (CoL and CerBur)all have the same Number.<br />
