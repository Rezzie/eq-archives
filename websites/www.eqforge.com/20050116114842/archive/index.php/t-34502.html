Reminds me of that episode of Futurama with the SmellOscope. The Professor says something like;<br />
<br />
&quot;The centre of gravity is located between this vein of hospital waste and this deposit of AOL discs....&quot;<br />
<br />
Hilarious!</div></div><hr />

AOL is a torrnetal piece of idiocy - kick-offs frequent and hellish, it's slower than other ISPs, and it's incompatible with YIM, MSN, or pop-up killers.<br />
---------------------<br />
I'm glad somebody is taking action against what AOL has been doing.  I've been bombarded with CDs way too long now...I think that I'll even send some CDs to them as well.</div></div><hr />

I have around twenty or so.  Most of 'em are from my dad's office, which I think is completely stupid.  They [dad's office] has a T-1 line and wouldn't sacrafice for AOL, even high-speed.</div></div><hr />
