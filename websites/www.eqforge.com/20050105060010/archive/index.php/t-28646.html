<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 01, 2002, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've begun to wonder about the differences in BBS software that I've seen mentioned in many places.   I know a lot of computer stuff, but I one thing I'm not too familiar with is current BBS software, such as the pros and cons and limitations.  Also,  what about BBS software and the associated 3rd party enhancements?<br />
<br />
I remember last year that TF's old BBS software began trashing the database, and he installed this one which (seems) pretty good, at least to the end user like me.<br />
<br />
So is there a &quot;best&quot; BBS (probably not; eveything has its highs and lows)?  And what are the important differences from an user's point of view?  What about from the Admin's point of view?<br />
<br />
Thanks :).</div></div><hr />

If you'd like an example, stroll on over to gamecatcher and see an example of phpBB in use.<br />
<br />
Click here (http://www.phpbb.com/features.php) to visit phpBB's features page.<br />
<br />
For busier sites that have a little more money, VBull is the best. You obviously can see the user functions plus there is an absolute ****load of hacks that have been formed for it.<br />
<br />
Here (http://www.vbulletin.com/features/index.html) is VBulletin's features page. You can see that both BBs are very well programmed but VB has many added features that phpBB doesn't have. Of course, there's always the monetary issue and VB is quite expensive IIRC.<br />
<br />
Also, visit here (http://www.vbulletin.com/admindemo/) for a demo of VB. You can log into the admin account using the password and username admin. phpBB has a similar feature but it was having database problems at the time of this post.<br />
<br />
UBB is just crap!!! Actually, I don't know about UBB except that CFC used to use it and it was causing all sorts of problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Black Fluffy Lion</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 03:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">phpBB is the best...if Jelsoft died and were replaced by some kind hearted company and vBull was free then phpBB would still be the best.<br />
<br />
those who have $160 to spill - you would be better just getting phpBB and spending the money on something else.<br />
<br />
ubb and all similar flat file based fora systems are crap (I think ubb is flat filed, isn't it??)...they aren't flexible, aren't easy to run and are resource hogs...all (yes this includes vBull) fora software which are dbed are better than flat file ones.</div></div><hr />

yep, but I'm right :p<br />
<br />
vBull is going down in popularity, it'll be dead before phpBB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceBlaZe</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">vBull tops phpBB a bit.<br />
<br />
I've been in many forums that use both, I still think vBull is better.<br />
<br />
UBB is crap because it uses CGI. CGI is a major resource hog since most server admins, even experienced ones, do not run the server right to handle heavy CGI loads without hogging the CPU.<br />
<br />
phpBB and vBull are both better because they both use php and mysql which runs well even on not-so-good configured servers, as long as the forum doesn't get too busy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">IceBlaZe</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, UBB lacks features and convinience phpBB and vBull have.<br />

Do I really have to write out a whole comparison between the two BBs so we can study each individual feature and decide which BB is better. <br />

Nope, just my prediction... *looks into crystal ball for a prediction*<br />
<br />
invisionboard will grow in popularity and will overtake all php/mysql bbs. Then, when phpBB 2.2 is released, phpBB will become the most popular. After invisonboard have improved a bit to catch up with phpBB then, vBull will go DOWN DOWN DOWN and people will get phpBB or invisionboard if they want a php/mysql fora...gradually, vBull will dissolve into nothingness (hopefully pulling jelsoft down with them too), and phpBB will nose in front again. Flat file ones won't go down so easily though, same for the ezboard/other crappy remotely hosted bbs fora.<br />
<br />
Do I really have to write out a whole comparison between the two BBs so we can study each individual feature and decide which BB is better. <br />
<br />
if you want, but I already know that phpBB is the best. I could contribute to the phpBb section :D<br />
<br />

<br />
invisionboard = WTF????<br />
phpBB = :p<br />
VB = :D<br />
<br />
I predict the makers of phpBB will lose interest over their non-profit project and when VB is being improved constantly it will easily build on it's already massive lead over phpBB. phpBB will become ONLY an open source project. ezboard will never die out because people are cheap :)</div></div><hr />

phpBB = even better bbs<br />
vB = money leeching scum<br />
<br />
if you haven't even heard of invisionboard then I suggest you suss up on bbs before trying to write a comparison between them :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
 predict the makers of phpBB will lose interest over their non-profit project<br />
<br />
it has been stated that unless all the devs of phpBB die in a plane crash and the project is taken over by some capitalist scum (enter jelsoft :lol: ) then phpBB will always remain free. the project isn't gonna crash that easily either...the people who code it are dedicated people<br />
<br />
<br />
it will easily build on it's already massive lead over phpBB.<br />
<br />
someone hasn't noticed that phpbb.com has thousands more members than vbulletin.com :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
phpBB will become ONLY an open source project.<br />
<br />
it already is :rolleyes:<br />

[B]Members don't indicate which board is better, just whos is cheaper.<br />
<br />
so that's why vBull's 'already massive lead over phpBB' is non existant??<br />
<br />
And I don't know abuot invisionboard, most likely because I really only visit a few BBs anymore, and have never seen an invisionboard. If you have a link, share it. <br />

www.invisionboard.com they're one of the main contenders in the php/mySQL bbs nowadays and will probably overtake vBull and maybe phpBB too before the release of phpBB 2.2 IMHO</div></div><hr />

<br />
wtf?! I would never say that as I know it's not true. phpBB can take as much load as invisionboard and vBull and practically any other mySQL based fora. The limit is on the db system, not the bbs. mySQL crumples easily under a heavy load, that's not the bbs fault, it's the db<br />

BFL, do you have any idea when 2.2 is going to be ready?  Sometime later this fall maybe?  Thats going to be really great, with a better User CP, Global Announcements, Sub-Forums, and hopefully a portal :D .  Can't wait for that release.  2.0.2 is going to be released in the next few days though.  <br />

Does one have to pay for updates to VBull, or are they free once one buys it for the first time?</div></div><hr />

So really I can't see where gonzo get this vbull rocks crap cos well it doesnt. Also phpbb has a **** ( :rolleyes: ) lot of hacks as well.</div></div><hr />

And I have to agree with spy, since I was able to see vbull inside and out as well, phpbb's admin panel is simply less confusing.<br />
<br />
Positive for vbull : Attachments. Still that's planned features for phpbb, but it's really a big advantage, though there is a mod that allow it for phpbb.<br />
<br />
Negative for vbull : (Personnal opinion) I don't like the template system. Second thing is the number of query. That tends to slow things down since the number of query is a lot higher than phpbb. Finally, the price.<br />
<br />
Positive for phpBB : Reduced number of query, ease of use.<br />
<br />
Negative : A few features missing, but that are going to be fixed with the next major release, or that already have been added by mods.<br />
<br />
Overall comparison : In fact, they are almost the same thing. I'd say that the template system for phpbb is a bit better, as you really don't need any php stuff in. I got messed up with vbull's. Vbull has a few more features, but also cost a lot more (compared to free) But overall, they are almost the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 07, 2002, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are some interesting things in this thread!   It seems amazing that one BBS does not have a provision for attachments.  That seems like a basic function.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sodapop</div><div class="date">Aug 07, 2002, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well with permissions and that kind of stuff it can be somehow hard to code, even for an experienced coder. Anyway, there are always drawbacks to multiple uploads. And just like here at cfc, a site ends up with too much attachments stuff. CFC found its solution with the upload thing TF added. Anyway, the base of the forum software doesn't really absolutely require the upload function, though it's a really useful one. But anyway, the fact is that vbulletin is a more mature software than phpbb, that was released only a few months ago. Just let them the time to develop more stuff ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Black Fluffy Lion</div><div class="date">Aug 08, 2002, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">vBull decided to not give me my password back so I've been unable to respond for a couple of days...sorry for the lack of vBull bashing recently. so now is time to make up for it... :D<br />
<br />
spy:<br />
I've experinced vbull and phpbb both from an admin PoV and I must say I got lost in vbulls admin panel.And no not because it's big but because it's confusing.<br />
<br />
For once I totally agree with spy. vBull admin is hell to get around. Eveything is layed out higeldypiggldy (spelling doesn't matter on fake words :p) and there's so much crap lying around. Now this layout deal isn't an opinion thing. Go to the admin demo at www.vbulletin.com...now can you honestly tell me that that admin panel is <br />
<br />
a) nicely layed out<br />
b) easy to use<br />
c) looks nice??<br />
<br />
No you can't unless you are blind.<br />
<br />
What phpBB doesnt have compared to vbull is either a) not nessacary be cause it is a useless feature b) not out yet read 2.2 .<br />
<br />
Again, suprisingly :p spy is right...I will admit now that vBull has a very powerful admin panel once you've got used to the clunky interface/overlapping buttons etc...but 2.2 is looking truly amazing. I've seen the dev admin panel - it's as nicely layed out as the current one and has a hell of a lot more features too. The permissions system  comparable to vBull, but with phpBB you can actually get around the admin panel without tripping over ugly writing and screwy buttons.<br />
<br />
So really I can't see where gonzo get this vbull rocks crap cos well it doesnt. Also phpbb has a **** ( :rolleyes: ) lot of hacks as well.<br />
<br />
No, phpBB has no hacks...it does have a number of mods though<br />
<br />
soda:<br />
Tsk Tsk Tsk... Not hacks. Mods.<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
Positive for vbull : Attachments. Still that's planned features for phpbb, but it's really a big advantage, though there is a mod that allow it for phpbb.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah, attachments...I've never liked them and never will. Why??<br />
<br />
a) it takes up bandwith/space<br />
b) people decided to use the fora upload system as their own personal webspace and then hotlink it<br />
c) multiple security holes/server config errors etc<br />
<br />
basically, it's a system just waiting to be abused in some way.<br />
<br />
Negative for vbull : (Personnal opinion) I don't like the template system. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now this isn't an opinion thing. vBull templateing engine is WEAK, fullstop. This is the thing that phpBB does the best in - templates. phpBB templating system is great. it's very easy to use, and create new styles. You don't get intermingled php and html or anything. Plus, phpBB is definately the best looking board out there (ok, that last point is an opinion thing)...but you do get the best templates with phpBB, both free and paid for...vereor, subblue, kail's work on templates is amazing...<br />
<br />
and things are only getting better template wise. for 2.2, the templating engine will be based on smarty (if you have no idea what I'm on about, look at http://smarty.php.net/). Smarty is, IMHO, the greatest templating engine ever. I've seen some of the first steps of 2.2's templates and it simply blows all other competition away.<br />
<br />
Whatever you think about phpBB, it's templating system is and will be the greatest.<br />
<br />
Second thing is the number of query. That tends to slow things down since the number of query is a lot higher than phpbb.<br />
<br />
Yep, vBull is full of queries. Perhaps it's just because they like to break their queries down (I don't know since I've never had a chance to look at the source code - I'd probably be sued by Jelsoft if I did :rolleyes: ) but vBull definately has more queries...20 - 30 to display a topic compared to 10-20 with phpBB. But phpBB isn't that great on speed/queries. If your server can't take the amount of queries with phpBB then it's pathetic. I will say though that invb is faster and has less queries than phpBB...this is quite impressive seeing as it uses attachments which tend to take up a lot of queires.<br />
<br />
Finally, the price.<br />
<br />
Well not even gonzo can say that vBull is cheaper than phpBB :D<br />
<br />
Positive for phpBB : ...ease of use.<br />
<br />
Another strong point for phpBB - ease of use. phpBB is soooooo easy to install. No chmod this, chmod that like with invb, just download, unzip, upload and run install. I have heard many people who have come over from vBull/snitz/ubb/yabb saying about how easy it is to install and run phpBB. And if you can't figure it out then I honestly think that phpBB's community fora is the best support place there is...<br />
<br />
You ask a question at phpBB.com, chances are it'll be answered in under 10 minutes. without boasting or anything, phpBB support is the best there is. One thing that bugged me when I was having a look at invb was that they had paid services for support! That's almost as bad as vBull who have 'special offers' where they will offer real support of install the fora for a small fee of $100.<br />
<br />
invb - open source?? after the support do, I'm afraid not :(<br />
<br />
Negative : A few features missing, but that are going to be fixed with the next major release, or that already have been added by mods.<br />
<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
Overall comparison : In fact, they are almost the same thing.<br />
<br />
that is wrong, wrong, wrong! I'm offended by that :mad:<br />
<br />
I'd say that the template system for phpbb is a bit better,<br />
<br />
That is also wrong wrong wrong! phpBB template system is a lot better.<br />
<br />
But overall, they are almost the same.<br />
<br />
wrong!<br />
<br />
sl:<br />
There are some interesting things in this thread! It seems amazing that one BBS does not have a provision for attachments. That seems like a basic function<br />
<br />
not really. only a small handful of bbs have attachment support. hell, I read an article the other day which praised phpBB because it had a profile system!! oooh, how advanced.<br />
<br />
phpBB, vBull, invb are all at the top end of the bbs world. Attachments are not an ordinary feature...as I said, having a profile isn't an ordinary feature with most bbs.<br />
<br />
But anyway, the fact is that vbulletin is a more mature software than phpbb, that was released only a few months ago. Just let them the time to develop more stuff <br />
<br />
phpBB is only a few of months younger than vBull</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll love 2.2 CVS :D Such fun to play with, the admin panel permissions is brilliant :yeah: I don't code phpBB, no...there's a little something which  I helped code which should be coming with 2.0.2</div></div><hr />

Bah get offended as much as you want, vbull is still not entirely crap like you say :p<br />
<br />
That is also wrong wrong wrong! phpBB template system is a lot better <br />
<br />
Doesn't vbull allow you to mod the templates through the admin panel? If so then, phpbb's is only a bit better :p<br />
<br />
wrong! <br />
<br />
Continue to get offended, but they mostly have the same features, so I call them almost the same anyway :p<br />
<br />
Oh, and a few months older helps a lot for software maturity, so I'll continue to say vbull is more mature than phpbb. :p <br />
<br />
But the rest about the community and the quick answer is true though :goodjob: <br />
<br />
And I must say that the CVS of 2.2 looks great indeed :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I tried to install the CVS at lycos.co.uk, just to fool around with, but it would not install correctly.  What does CVS mean anyway?  They are both nearly the same, although one is free and one is not, and in the long run, the free ones usually get more support and better people working on them.<br />
<br />
This is a bit OT, but this is the error message during the install:<br />
<br />
SQL ERROR [ mysql ]<br />
<br />
Duplicate entry 'default_lang' for key 1<br />
<br />
PAGE<br />
<br />
/baseballtwin/install/install.php&amp;<br />
<br />
SQL<br />
<br />
INSERT INTO phpbb_config (config_name, config_value) VALUES ('default_lang', 'english')<br />
<br />
<br />
And did anyone see that new theme released by Daz today.  That was sweet.  I think that phpBB install was very easy when I did it, and the support for it is phenomenal.  Many talented people code for it all the time.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Well, i got it to work but can't login :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sodapop</div><div class="date">Aug 08, 2002, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CVS stands for Current Version Snapshot or something. Anyway, they are the most up to date files, but they may not be stable. That's one more positive for phpbb. Average user can participate in the creation and the quality of the software trought cvs by reporting bugs. On your problem baseballtwin, well there is nothing you can do, except wait tomorrow hoping this part will be fixed ;)<br />
<br />
Oh, and I know this is old stuff from page 1, but anyway. If developpers were about to leave the project there would surely be a lot of people ready to continue and to try to imrpove it. That makes one more positive point for phpbb, as the project will probably never die because of a lack of funding. :D</div></div><hr />

I didn't say that, I said that phpBB templating engine is a lot better than vBull's, which is true.<br />
<br />
<br />
Doesn't vbull allow you to mod the templates through the admin panel? If so then, phpbb's is only a bit better :p<br />

I don't know, does it?? being able to edit it through the admin panel doesn't make it much better<br />

Concurrent versions system<br />

no they're not<br />

strip the admin verification and you won't have to to see the admin panel (which is where you can see the most changes currently)</div></div><hr />

wow, you got that working well GIMP :) admin looks fuller than mine does, I'll have to update soon. and it's 2.1 CVS, not 2.2 :p non-admin changes are starting to come through too, especially on the 2.2 test board at http://area51.phpbb.com/phpBB22/ :D</div></div><hr />
