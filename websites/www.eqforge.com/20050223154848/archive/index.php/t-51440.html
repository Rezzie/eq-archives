<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Apr 25, 2003, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the nomination funxus, but I shall decline. Firstly, it's about time someone else had a chance, secondly I can hear my old desk in the Foreign Office calling, and thirdly this time next week I'm getting married - so I'll be away for a week or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Apr 25, 2003, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congratulations!!!:D <br />
<br />
I'm not really sure what to say to someone getting married? Happy marriage?:)<br />
<br />
Anyway, where are you going? Abroad?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Apr 25, 2003, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a surprise! Somewhere in Europe - maybe somewhere an hours flight awaylike Dublin or Paris. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Apr 25, 2003, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the nominations - I accept them (for military advisor and domestic advisor).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">Apr 25, 2003, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congratulations Jayne! Are you going to get him involved in the DG? Lol, if you go to Paris in two months you'd see me! :)<br />
<br />
Anyways, its time for me to get out of military, there are too many people running, so instead of military I will run for the only position besides President I haven't held: Domestic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">:) Congrats, Jayne.  I hope you don't plan on leaving us like gonzo did after his marriage...<br />
<br />
On another note, I will be declining my gracious nomination to the FA desk.  I haven't been as active here as of late, especially considering my participation in multimple other democracy games (even the Civ3 DG in Apolyon!).<br />
Besides, I stepped up to the plate in the face of a dying Fanatica that had lessening participation.  Now, there are so many newer faces more dedicated and experienced in Civ2 than I'll ever be.  Not to worry,  I still plan to stick around as a citizen and occasional particpator in lackluster elections.<br />
Now, where did I put that doughnut...</div></div><hr />
