To what end shall we direct their inquiries?   All ideas suggested in the &quot;Straight to Monarchy&quot; thread are included here, plus any additional I may think of in the process :D<br />
<br />
Three parts A) vote for our first tech goal; B) vote for the individual tech you would want should something in the path to our goal not be available.  Should that tech be taken and we need another, we'll just take the next down the list.  Make sense?<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: The poll is not a multi-poll, so you can only select one item to vote on.  Pick the best option for now.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zelig</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2003, 06:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We can't do part B; we can only vote once on the poll.  However, if the game is saved in 2.42 this would be  unnessecary_because we can go straight for whatever tech without any detours.<br />
<br />
I voted straight to monarchy, with a secondary goal of pottery, for the hanging gardens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DvR</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2003, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, 2 things.. <br />
What about Bronze working, shouldn't that be in part B?<br />
And aren't the radio buttons supposed to be those checkbox kinda things, so you can choose 1 in each catagory?<br />
<br />
Well anyways, i choose Republic..<br />
I kinda like an early republic because of the nice amount of trade it gives, and it's rather challenging imo..<br />
<br />
The individual tech would be either pottery or bronzeworking, depending on the situation (good spot for ssc -&gt; take bronze working for colossus, otherwise go for pottery for hanging gardens)<br />
<br />
If alphabet is chosen as first alternate tech, then i'd go for writing (as it leads to republic)<br />
<br />
<br />
Well anyways, that's just me..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DvR</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2003, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woops, my bad..  didn't see DoMs' post with the starting info..<br />
So that leaves Pottery for part B</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2003, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted Republic - for a bit of a change, maybe a challenge?;)<br />
<br />
I would go for B) Pottery and C)Writing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shahadet</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2003, 08:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe that the crown should come before the conferance room! The republic, although challenging could damage early expansion in the game and make it more difficult to raise the necessary production. Once the ground work is in place then republic would be nice. Monarchy and Pottery should be the key points. An early Hanging Gardens is most beneficial. <br />
<br />
What about trade? I would suggest trade after the above suggestions, followed by republic. With trade we can build Marco Polos, trade with all civs, reduce science time with key civ gifting and reveal massive portions of the map!!</div></div><hr />

Leowind, this is a fine poll, don't worry.  Next time you'll get it.  I would always check the odd little boxes first, Multiple, Expire, before I got lost in thought on the poll itself.  And if you Update Options or something, it forgets so we must remember to recheck the odd little boxes.  My 0.02.</div></div><hr />

DoM: Vote changed</div></div><hr />

Yes, it is 2.42, but I believe even 2.42 has the 'hidden tech' aspect.  Only if the game is saved as a scenario does it allow direct techs.  The last game was also in 2.42 and I believe it also had 'hidden techs'.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I see, that makes sense.</div></div><hr />

I distinctly remember clicking the multiple choices box, so I dont' know what went wrong.  Then again, I was working very late and was getting pretty sleepy :need a yawn smiley here: :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2003, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Open a new poll if you like. :)<br />
<br />
Also, I tried to clean up the poll since we started with Alphabet as well.</div></div><hr />

Open a new poll if you like. :)I thought of that, but there really isn't time for everyone to vote again, so I figured this flawed poll would be better than an incomplete one.<br />
<br />
Also, I tried to clean up the poll since we started with Alphabet as well. Thanks :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />
