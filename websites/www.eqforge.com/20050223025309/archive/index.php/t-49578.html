(I copied Vikings pic, added C9 and red dot at hut)<br />
<br />
If you have any other suggestions, post em below.. Although I tried to include everything mentioned in the 'Next turn - 2450bc' thread..<br />
<br />
EDIT: I'm taking over funxus' job while he's away (since I was deputy domnestic).. But now there have been new elections, and I'm no longer in a department (I'm a bit busy with school the comming weeks), so I don't know if I should have posted this poll, but anyways, as Jayne wants to move I felt we had to get things clear...<br />
<br />
EDIT: oh, I forgot to include one option: if we go for wonder/temple in SSC, do we first complete the unit or switch directly (losing shields)..  Include this in a reply please...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DvR</div><div class="date">Apr 04, 2003, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted:<br />
a: RF change production to settler<br />
b: LP settler build road where he stands now, then:<br />
b2: LP settler move to C8, build city<br />
c1: Rush build settler to disband SSC and rebuild SSC 1 square NW  (yes yes I know, I'm a bit stubborn (or however it's written :))<br />
d1: Build FILL city<br />
d4: Build city at C4  (I like this spot as a canal city)<br />
e2: Warrior keep heading east<br />
f: Elephant pop the hut 2 squares south (at red dot)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Apr 04, 2003, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted for the LP settler not to build road where it is. The reason is that instead I want it to build a road on the grassland shield just S of RF as a first step towards connecting RF and the SSC with a road. And building road on both squares is premature. The settler should then found a city.<br />
<br />
I voted to first build a temple in the SSC and I think we should rush buy it. If we decide we need units in the SSC RF can build them.<br />
<br />
After the elephant pops the hut it should continue exploring (unless we get barbarians from the hut...) to the west.<br />
<br />
Finally, I voted for FILL and C4. C2 might be a nice idea in the future but C4 is a better place for a city so I prefer to found a city there before before C2 (also we do not have any ships yet).</div></div><hr />

RF Settler, LP founds C6 River Bridge, &amp;nbsp; Keep SSC asis, Temple then Wonder, &amp;nbsp; found FILL, Warrior keep walking.<br />
<br />
LP build was not polled: change Dip to Settler.<br />
SSC is building a Dip.  Not sure.  Seems like a long delay.<br />
<br />
Btw, Sci=60%, Treas $47, F5 $3 -0, Sci 5/10, F11 Mfg=7 #1</div></div><hr />

<br />
ABout your suggestion to change LP dip to settler: could that work, looking at food vs shield production?  Since it doesn't produce any food surplus now, and it's still only size 1..</div></div><hr />

You seem to be correct.  It will be 4-5 turns before it builds C6 River Bridge City.  That is why the original plan was to build FILL. <br />
<br />
LP 6 + 5*2 = 16.  Then Settler in 8, but grows in 18, so LP must build a unit first.  How about a Phx that walks over to SSC, and we switch SSC Dip production to Temple right now.  That only &quot;wastes&quot; 4 SSC shields, but time is of the essence.  I'd rather forgo the 4 shields of accum production, rather than throw good production after bad.  My 0.02</div></div><hr />

This looks like a good idea.<br />
<br />
It seems the result of the poll will be for the settler to build a road where it is now. I'm not against building a road near RF, however I'm strongly against building a road on this particular square now. The reason is that building a road on the square just south of RF is much better because it is a first step towards connecting RF and the SSC with a road. The settler is going there anyway so we do not waste any time building a road there instead of on the square where the settler is now (unless we want road on both squares but that is entirely premature IMO).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Apr 06, 2003, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree w TheViking.  Also, the GLS S of RF can be irrigated easily some day, the square where it stands can not.<br />
<br />
I am hoping the poll decides to build C6.  A River Bridge will be very valuable, also built quicker.  All future movement will be quicker.  C8 leaves me cold.</div></div><hr />
