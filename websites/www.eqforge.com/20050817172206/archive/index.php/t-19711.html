<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And here they are: the results of the Game of the Month of March (http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3gotm/civ3gotm_results_05.shtml). It was clearly a very difficult game, because of the map. One third of the participants has lost the game. Another third has reached victory by space ship and just a handful of people had the game completely under their control.<br />
<br />
The game has been won by SirPleb (cultural). Congratulations! He's followed by Aeson (also cultural) and Lucky (the only victory by conquest and fastest finish). SirPleb has taken the lead in the Global Ranking (http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3gotm/civ3gotm_ranking.shtml).<br />
<br />
Other awards<br />
Domination: Trash<br />
Space race: Dirty Clint (with lots of rivalry)<br />
Diplomatic: falcon512<br />
Histographic: Beard Rinker<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; GOTM #5 results (http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3gotm/civ3gotm_results_05.shtml)<br />
&gt;&gt; (Renewed) Hall of Fame (http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3gotm/civ3gotm_hof.shtml)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey cool! Some new awards for me.<br />
That´s really something to celebrate again.<br />
[dance] :cool: [dance]<br />
But I´m really surprised that I am the only conquerer in this game. Has everybody else turned towards milking the game??? :eek:<br />
<br />
Anyway, congrats to everybody again. But doesn´t it get boring for SirPleb and Aeson?!? ;)<br />
I guess not!<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chiefpaco</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congrats to the winners.  I found conquest a pretty tough affair on this map.  I could not milk, the SS was the only way I could win this game!<br />
<br />
I also see the huge separation between the top scores here &amp; me.  That means a ton of work...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 03:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey, turns out I did *MUCH* better then expected. 28th place out of 80-some people gets my :goodjob: It's more remarkable seeing how bad my early game was... I challenge anyone reading this to look at my replay and see just how BAD I started out. I had like 6 cities in 10AD (compared to some 25 with a &quot;slightly&quot; ;) better start in GOTM6) and things just plain sucked.<br />
<br />
Looks like the map was really, really hard, the toughest yet. 1/3 of the submissions were losing ones? :eek: Considering that there were probably 2 losses for each 1 submitted to Matrix, that's a lot of frustrated people. I hope anyone who lost the game is cheered up by these results, and best luck to all in the next competition!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 04:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never get frustrated with Civ3. I could care less if I loose. :) Of course I'm doing my best ;), but if I loose then so be it.<br />
<br />
And indeed, I don't think many people even had the opportunity to milk the game. Hence the number of space ship victories.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually decided against a conquest victory in about 1980 because I thought space ship would be the &quot;dark horse&quot; :rolleyes:  We really ought to have a smiley that smacks its own head and says &quot;doh!&quot;.  Not like my score would have been anywhere near enough for a medal anyway.<br />
<br />
One thing I will say:  it was fun!<br />
<br />
MATRIX: keep looking for evil, evil maps like that :satan:.  They make the Civ III GOTM a great challenge!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe it would get boring if I ever guessed right on an award Lucky. ;)  You're right up there with medals and have a very impressive award count!<br />
<br />
Great job on the HOF page Matrix.  I was wondering how you'd choose to deal with the old and new awards, really like the format you came up with.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirty Clint</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 06:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congratulations SirPleb, Aeson, &amp; Lucky. Great scoring guys.<br />
A special congratulations to SirPleb for knocking me off the top, you deserve to be there with the way you have been playing. :goodjob: <br />
 Matrix, you deserve an award too for all the hard work that you put in each month in making this the best Civ3 tournament on the net - thanks :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirPleb</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 11:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks all! Dirty Clint, I owe it all to you, you demonstrated the value of a careful endgame so clearly in GOTM2 :) Guess I have to watch my back now :)<br />
<br />
I sure enjoyed the stories this month! There sure were a lot of different ways people played this one, a lot of great writeups, and many well played tough situations!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Black Fluffy Lion</div><div class="date">Apr 06, 2002, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">congrats to the people that came high up. 84th out of 88...ouch</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goodbye_mr_bond</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2002, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just had to pop in to say: Zachriel's timeline for his last game of the month is just excellent! The best I've read in a long, long time. <br />
<br />
It's brief, focuses on a manageable number of 'historic' events, and is supported by well-chosen screen shots which really give you a good feel for how the game developed. My hat's truly off!<br />
:goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldasar</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2002, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:( I came on 81st place... :( But i am going to be better in GOTM VI ... So watch your backs  ;) I am coming with a :rocket3:</div></div><hr />
