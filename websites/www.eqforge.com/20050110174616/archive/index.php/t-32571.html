They being cheap gave me and e-machines.  Here is the list of things that broke with it.<br />
<br />
Moniter (Completly stopped working)<br />
Speakers (suddenly became inaudible except in a perfectly sileint room)<br />
Mouse (Broke after I dropped it about a foot on carpet)<br />
Keyboard (Just wore out)<br />
Printer (Made my paper look like an accordian)<br />
Power Supply (1 month after I got it)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also the 333mhz processer ran slower than my parents 200mhz machine.  The case took 2 people to get back on.  And Its fan Makes horridly loud noises.</div></div><hr />

But whoever is buying a complete system off the shelf doesn´t deserve anything else. :p<br />
<br />
Here in Germany the low-price supermarkets are now selling PCs for very low prices at certain times, too! But even they beat many of the manufacturers mentioned. :lol:<br />
<br />
The only I´d halfway trust would be Dell. But only for professional systems, not home PCs or such.<br />

compaq is worst, but all computers that have integrated graphics aren't much better. though it is hard to beat compaq. R.I.P. all compaq users.</div></div><hr />

If they don't own the machine which they're blaming the manufacturer, then it's even more stupid, since I wonder how they can judge without using it.</div></div><hr />

That's not necessarily a valid assumption. The reason I voted Compaq is not that I ever owned one, but had to use one at work. And then there are machines that people you know own.</div></div><hr />

IF THEY HAVE LUCK LIKE ME!!!<br />
<br />
Then they should ALWAYS buy a boxed system.<br />
<br />
I have HORRIBLE luck building systems for my self. :(  Almost makes me want to go amish. ;)<br />
<br />
At least with a Dell I can complain enough and they will replace it. :)<br />
<br />
I can't remember who I voted for....but I've heard bad things about Compaq (although the 3 I've used have been great.  The Comcrap Persuckio's :)), the HP one I used was awesome...except is had WinME! :mad:<br />
<br />
The Dell's were great, the Gateway one was a little flaky.  The E-machines one wasn't great....but not too bad. Packard-Bell sucked.  The Tandy's I've used were all solid machines.  All still working today. :)</div></div><hr />

As for my voting for packard bell. Those are the worst quality machines I've ever seen. If you want the most bang for the buck you will of course need to make your own system provided you aren't incornpetent :D.<br />

Packard bell is some awful crap!<br />

Hewlett packard, on the other hand, is all right :)</div></div><hr />

Not neccasarily some of my local computer stores come out with computers that are similarly priced with the home-made ones, they buy parts in bulk and so can save money and give us good deals too!</div></div><hr />

I've still got an old Laser 486.  Chugging away just like she did a decade ago.  <br />

I haven't owned anything not self built except for my very first machine, an emachines.  A lot of people consider them to be the worst of the worst, but for my lowly purposes (back then anyway) it was fine.  Now, i'm working on a beastly mother****er with a 2500 dollar budget.

As someone who fixed Compaq Notebooks for a living from 2000-2001, I can tell you Compaq notebooks are really, really bad.  And I am not talking about seeing an occasional compaq notebook, I supported +- 1000 remote users, all of which had compaq Armada M700, M300, or 7400.  we estimated that 1/3 of the 7400 had to have their displays replaced within that year.  The first runs of the M700 had a design flaw where if you picked the laptop up with one hand lifting on either side of the notebook, it would power the system down.  :confused:  1 out of 8 (or so)of the  M700 had to have the motherboard replaced over the course of the year.  Don't even get me started on the M300, the biggest ripoff ever manufactured.  And the worst part is when we would repair these P.O.S.,  it was relatively common for the replacment part sent by compaq to also be defective.  Compaq's managment obviously emphasises immediate profits over quality and high-value products.</div></div><hr />

My parents had a Packard Bell and it was the worst computer I have ever seen.  I bought a compaq mini-tower system when I went to college (200 MHz MMX, Woo Hoo) that worked fine for 2 years, they pissed me off for all time and I will never but another because of exclusive upgrade pieces as Gonzo has said.  My current comuter is a Dell Inpiron 5000 Laptop.  This is still a powerful machine for everthying but 3d gaming.  I voted for Packard Bell.</div></div><hr />

Well i have a Packard Bell and it kinda sucks, but my friend had a Gateway and it was SOO much worse! <br />
<br />
No way! I have a Gateway now, its great! They have very good customer service, some guy stayed on the line for an hour while my mother tried to install more RAM. I was trying to tell her what to do, but NO...;) :lol:<br />
<br />
I voted Compaq, from experience. My computer before this one was a Compaq, it was a bad experience. It worked on a daily basis, but it was a pain. And my sister's laptop is a Compaq. It is better than my old computer, but its not as good as some of the other manufacturers out there.<br />
