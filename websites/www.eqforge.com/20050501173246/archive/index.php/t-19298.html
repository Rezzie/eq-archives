<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">civ_steve</div><div class="date">Mar 28, 2002, 06:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My apologies if you've heard this idea before and rejected it, but how about a Game of The Quarter?  These games would be open for 3 months, and go from the 15th to the 15th (for example, April 15th through July 15th) so it wouldn't interfere with the regular GOTM results tally.<br />
<br />
I'm well into GOTM #5, but with two days to go I don't think I'll be quite done, which is a little frustrating.  A GOTQ would allow more submittals, and representation of a wider range of skill levels.  This would also provide an additional Game for those who do complete the GOTM quickly.  If the concept is a popular one, the GOTQs could overlap, where a new one would start every month and up to 3 could be active at once.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Mar 29, 2002, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finished the current GOM(5) in about twelve days. Now in this if I where to do this in a game of the quarter then i would have to wait two and a half months before I could find out the results of the comp.  Im already overly anxious awiating the results of this game due to the fact that it is the first I have played, but I think i did pretty well, but im probably not the best.  I just dont want to wait so long for the results, especially when there are bound to be some people out there that would use all this time to play the game over and over again untill the have perfected that scenario and get an ultimate score.  Then my score would just be so small.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to quench your suggestion, but forget it. It won't work. These suggestions always turn out to a dead end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, let me introduce you the GOTM (game of the millenium). <br />
<br />
Everybody will have enough time to finish the game.<br />
<br />
Tip: Make sure to submit your game before you die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">civ_steve</div><div class="date">Mar 30, 2002, 07:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posted a suggestion for GOTQ because my style of play (very hands on, nothing automated) combined with the time I have available to play Civ3 makes it difficult for me to finish a GOTM within the month.  This is OK; if I ever am able to complete one, I will submit it; perhaps I will work on using the governors and other forms of automation.<br />
<br />
I don't expect Matrix to pick up another GOT- format.  I wouldn't have time to moderate it myself, it that were even possible.  I haven't seen many responses to this thread, so it would seem that there is not any enthusiasm for the concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Mar 30, 2002, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now how are we supposed to see how we scored compared to evryone else.  Geez man we won't be around to see how we scored against our great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, great, grandchildren.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kundor</div><div class="date">Apr 02, 2002, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We could continue making a game a month while extending the due date to the tenth of the month after.<br />
That way, fast players get the same amount of games, while slow players can finish a game.  They'll be behind on the next one, but this way they can turn in every other game(instead of none of them.) And results would still come out once a month...around the middle, though.</div></div><hr />
