<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2003, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the last wonder poll (see here (http://forums.civfanatics.com/poll.php?action=showresults&amp;pollid=4976)) Isaac Newton's College and Leonardo's Workshop received 7 votes, J.S. Bach's Cathedral 6 votes and Adam Smith's Trading Company 5 votes. These were far ahead of other wonders, Shakespeare's Theater came next with 2 votes.<br />
<br />
Of these we have built Isaac and have the techs for AS and Shakespeare. Building Shakespeare in Dou within 5 turns should be an almost automatic option, it eliminates all unhappy citizens there and therefore enables Dou to easily grow to size 20+ in the next 10-12 turns since we are about to discover sanitation. This growth is of crucial importance to our entire trade network and science progress.<br />
<br />
However, since it was so lowly rated last time I feel obliged to seek appproval in this poll to make Shakespeare the next wonder we build, ahead of Adam Smith even though AS was rated higher in the previous wonder poll. We will still build AS but it will be delayed for several turns. Building Shakespeare first is also important because the French are building it, however, no AI civ has the tech (economics) necessary to build AS.<br />
<br />
So I urge everyone in the strongest possible terms to vote for building Shakespeare now and Adam Smith a little later.</div></div><hr />
