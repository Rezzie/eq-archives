<br />
I would like to change and remake things in Civ 2...<br />
<br />
So first of all, how do I add more advances? I just want to point out that I don't want to use any of the old, remakeing them. I want to create totally new ones. How do I do that?<br />
<br />
Second, how do I add things in the civiliopedia? I don't want to change the existing things, but add new things.<br />
<br />
Third, anyone know if it's possible to create an air/transport unit. Like a big zeppelin, which can transport units. Is it possible?<br />
<br />
And atlast. Is there any programs or stuff out there which make these things easier?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2001, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Check out the reference material in the downloads section. There are some really good docs going into all of this.<br />
<br />
Basically, you just use the ingame editor (with MGE or FW) or edit the things directly into your &quot;rules.txt&quot; file. It's all in there... Be sure to make some safe copies first, though... It's almost self-explanatory, but be sure to read some of the excellent docs first, to save you from too many headaches.....<br />
<br />
 Second, how do I add things in the civiliopedia? I don't want to change the existing things, but add new things.<br />
<br />
If you have the classic version, you should remove &quot;getinfo.exe&quot; from your &quot;pedia&quot; folder. This removes the &quot;bogus&quot; pedia program, and the game will get pedia-information directly from your changed files. If you have another version of the game, there should be no problems viewing your changes in the pedia.<br />
<br />
If you want to add text to the existing texts, you should do it in one of the appropriate .txt-files, named pedia.txt or something like this.<br />
<br />
 Third, anyone know if it's possible to create an air/transport unit. Like a big zeppelin, which can transport units. Is it possible? <br />
<br />
Well, the best idea is to change the ocean into land in the graphics departement, and then change the transports into zeppeliners, but this has obvious disadvantages! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif Otherwise I know of no ways of making land or air units &quot;carry&quot; other units.<br />
<br />
But do check out the docs! There might be some other ways to tweak the game mechanics, so as to achieve the effects you want.</div></div><hr />

If you have the classic Civ2 (or other version for that matter),<br />
you can download a patch freely from the downloads section. There's a link to it at bottom of this page :<br />

<br />
-Well, it should be in there somewhere, though I can't seem to figure out where it is, as I just checked. It was there just recently! -Try browsing the web for it!<br />
