It was my first Monarch adventure and I'd just like to see where I stand when the standings come out. Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirty Clint</div><div class="date">Mar 18, 2002, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure you can submit a losing game. Just send in the details as per the GOTM rules page along with your last turns save. You may be surprised as to how you rank, it wont win but there will probably be quite a few losing scores in this game and its always worth submitting.</div></div><hr />

This WILL give me more points, right? I sure hope I'm not LOWERING my score by surviving longer. I'll still be nowhere near winning, but hey at least I will be alive!</div></div><hr />

The exception would be if you currently have less territory and population than the average you've had so far in the game. In that case your score could be going down. I suggest checking your score with F8, playing one turn, and checking it again - that will quickly tell you whether you're going up or not :)</div></div><hr />

I didn't realize that wasn't the right thing to do... :(</div></div><hr />
