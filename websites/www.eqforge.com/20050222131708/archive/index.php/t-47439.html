I've tried to list all the possibilities (and some will become not applicable depending on our research path), but doing this quickly as I have a meeting in 15 minutes :crazyeye: <br />
<br />
The first poll will stand for our primary research goal.  This new poll is for alternate techs should nothing in our chosen research path be available.</div></div><hr />

I voted Pottery, but now that I come to think of it, I think it really depends on. If we manage to get a good start, and can, without hurting the expansion too much, let two cities build wonders, I think we should take that chance. But if we wont be able to do that at all, maybe writing is a better idea.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zelig</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2003, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty much what funxus said, if we get a good start with enough cities we should go for Pottery to get a start on HG, otherwise writing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2003, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted for pottery because of HG. The 'runner-up' was writing, however, if I understand correctly (I'm completely new to this demogame stuff and have a lot of reading to do) bribing cities and units (including barbarians ?) is forbidden (somebody correct me if this is wrong). This makes diplomats far less useful than usual, otherwise I'd probably have voted for writing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bribing units is ok, cities is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talar</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2003, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My vote goes for writing. As it looks monarchy is winning as the first goal I think we should get philosophy next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Mar 14, 2003, 05:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Only 12 votes, and a very close race.  Our Queen moves tonight (I believe), so get your vote in!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zelig</div><div class="date">Mar 14, 2003, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted writing, I seemed to have missed this poll before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shahadet</div><div class="date">Mar 16, 2003, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted for writing. I had a change of heart on the government we should pursue. I think a rush to republic will be more beneficial for trade and scientific progress. (come on back me up here white coats and fat cats!) With writing we will get a 3 shield unit to help rush buy more settlers and the diplomat can be used in defence in replace of shield hogging phalanxe and warriors.</div></div><hr />
