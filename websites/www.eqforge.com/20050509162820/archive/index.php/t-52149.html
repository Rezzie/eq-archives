<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padma</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A question about the nobility ruleset:<br />
<br />
Will the holders of office in the main DG be allowed to have one of their characters assume that &quot;title&quot;?  In DG2, the player who held a DG office was given an automatic title in the Peerage.<br />
<br />
My personal preference would be to not do this, as our RPG characters have little real relationship with our primary DG roles.  This would also seem consistent with the way this game has started, with us being able to overthrow &quot;the Despot&quot; in the RPG, while having no connection to who the elected &quot;President&quot; is in the main DG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say no. Just as the Pres of the demogame is not the despot in the RPG. Same with the other offices. Now a player could certainly make a character that achieved the same position, it just wouldn't be an automatic thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No. Lines of heredity would pass to the eldest son (eldest child for us since we have ladies and want to be fair). Other children were pretty much on their own but could generally get established using their noble connections. Note that even though they do not hold a title all children of nobles are noble themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Co-despots? Hardly, they are advisors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, I'd like to make Aza and Antonius nobles.</div></div><hr />

Only one character is on the Upper Gentry (Noval Gontsky), but it will soon be passed down to his son. <br />
<br />
How can I get my characters on the &quot;Gentry&quot; list. (I know the Despot at this point would only have the authority of giving nobilities)</div></div><hr />

if yes then please add Elenora to the royal list as died in 3300BC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padma</div><div class="date">May 07, 2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@CG: I try to keep up on the other threads, but I don't always have time to check everything. ;)   It is very helpful for players to post changes to their status in this thread (with LINKS to the appropriate post!) so I can be sure to see them.  The Character thread is not a good source for this, because of occasional misunderstandings of what is allowed, e.g., people have created &quot;Noble&quot; and &quot;Royal&quot; characters, even though we explicitly said not to.<br />
<br />
Also, as Nobility Manager, IMO no one is higher than &quot;unlanded&quot; Lower Gentry at this point, unless and until the Despot raises people to explicit positions.<br />
<br />
@dis: That sounds like a good idea, but I fear that as characters are born, live, and die, the length of the list might become unmanagable.  I *will* keep track of deceased characters off-line, until I figure out the best way to handle them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 07, 2003, 08:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@padma: use a textfile as soon as the post gets too big.<br />
you could maybe maintain a &quot;royal genealogy&quot; in text or graphical files...<br />
or maybe... just use the bloodlines! make one file for each bloodline which hold the characters with birth death and relations between each other (note that &quot;external&quot; links to other lines are possible!). then only post the name of the &quot;bloodline&quot; (for example at the moment, it would be the &quot;d'Atrou bloodline&quot;) with a link to the list of characters :-)</div></div><hr />

(just to get an idea)<br />
you could of course use standard genealogical programs and graphics to do it :-)<br />
<br />
deputy despot is btw imho not a valid title for a noble... not even a valid function... advisors, grand visir, baron, count, etc. would be ok, but not &quot;deputy despot&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Or will they continue to be commoners but theyr children will be nobles? How does this work?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">May 15, 2003, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the caste level is a family thing. so an example:<br />
family a is common, consiting of person 1,2,3,4 and 5<br />
family b is noble, consisting of person 10,11,12,13<br />
if now person 5 marries person 13, then person 5 will be a noble (not: not the rest of the family, as 5 married into the family of 13).<br />
the children of 5+13 will all be noble<br />
<br />
note here:<br />
maybe a good idea to reflect this would be if the &quot;lower&quot; casted character would &quot;adopt&quot; the name of the higher casted one, even if the higher casted one is the woman.<br />
<br />
i think this way is wrong though...<br />
<br />
we should propably change it:<br />
my proposal: the caste is bound to the family name. on a marriage, the 2 can decide which name they will adpot. depending on which name they take, they will receive the appropriate caste setting for them and their family.<br />
example:<br />
as above, 5+13 marry.<br />
if they both will carry the family name of 5's family, they will be common. if they adpot 13's name, they will be noble.<br />
<br />
<br />
more specific example for my proposal:<br />
at the moment, the lines of lifespanius and datrus are royal.<br />
if the daughter of helena lifespanius wants to marry the commoner alfonso nobodicus, then they can choose between 3 methods:<br />
1) alfonso may adopt the name of lifespanius, and with that he and his children would be royal.<br />
2) bellona (helenas daughter) could though choose to be namen nobodicus and decline her royalty, on which bellona would become common and her husband and her children also.<br />
3) bellona could also choose to adopt her husbands name and still keep her birthname as second name. this would mean she would be known as bellone lifespanius nobodicus... her children and her husband would then stay nobodicus and thus common, but she would be a royal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 15, 2003, 01:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't like the idea, Dis. If we applied that to the Diutius/Helena Marraige, we would both lose our Royalty titles to one of Nobilty. Even though some of the men of the Roman Empire would have done that (I'm guessing at this because you like to stick to historical fact...), real men wouldn't give up their name to lick the boots of Royalty. Besides, I think I've let you claim all there is to claim in our marraige already, you greedy little girl :) .</div></div><hr />

he IS the prince of gorina... independant of the marriage.<br />
as such the house of lifespanius was &quot;created&quot; by the despot to administrate lifespanicia (i just invented that name :-P).<br />

shai: padma has a different interpretation though. we shouldnt even be royal normally, but there was no fitting case-setting for it otherwise :-P Actually, I just haven't differentiated Royal from Imperial yet in this thread.  Yet.  As I re-read some of the other rulesets, I do see where it does affect lifespan, so I should make it a point to specify.  My apologies for any earlier confusion.<br />
<br />
The Despot and his immediate family are Imperial.  Other Princes/Princesses are considered Royalty.<br />
<br />
If we become a Monarchy, the King will be Royalty, as will any other &quot;Petty&quot; or rival Kings.  If some character becomes a &quot;High King/King of Kings/Emperor&quot; (i.e., a King holding the fealty of other Kings), then that character and his immediate family will be Imperial.</div></div><hr />

rubinia (daughter of bellona)<br />
<br />
she just married neo disaamuel, and as such will be renamed to &quot;Caesaria DiSaaMuel Lifespanius Rubinia&quot;<br />
<br />
i dont know the exact status though...<br />
the status should be royal at least...<br />
she is the daughtr of caeser jadius, so it may even be imperial until he dies and another despot is coming...<br />
<br />
note to the status:<br />
neo disaamuel keep his caste status<br />
each of the resulting children will be given rubinia's or neo's status on a case by case decission (rubinia's if the child is a lifespanian, neo's if its a disaamuel).</div></div><hr />

note that rubinia died on giving birth to 2 children. my new character, vendetta lifespania, will take controll of all ownings and claims royalty as she is the aunt of rubinia and thus legitimately inheriting the caste and title from her as noone of her direct successors is left in an adultish state.</div></div><hr />

note that the 2 children rubinia lifespania gave birth to before her death were:<br />
Lucentio DiSaaMuel Lifespanius<br />
Elizabeth DiSaaMuel<br />
<br />
As seen from the name, Elizabeth will belong to the DiSaaMuel Family, whereas Lucentio will be officially adopted into the Lifespanian Royal Line.<br />
<br />
The 2 only member of that family alife at this moment are Vendetta Lifespanius and Lucentio. Vendetta leads the clan at the moment.</div></div><hr />
