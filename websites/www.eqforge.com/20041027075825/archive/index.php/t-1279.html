<br />
I just received this screen shot from kobayashi. It's a scenario he's been working on that sounds exciting. Basically, as I understand it, the scenario is meant to capture the wars of the Federation and the dominion, as the title suggests. <br />
<br />
Obviously, one of the best ideas for a Star Trek scenario to date.<br />
<br />
Just click on it to see it!<br />

It is for play as the Federation only, and simulates the Dominion war from the mining of the worm hole to the fall of the Great link. In it you will meet the founders, the cardassians, Sisko, the pa-raiths, the prophets, klingons, romulans, and the breen. A unique map with the wormhole, the alpha quadrant, and the founder's homeworld. The many different classes of ships of all sides are here, with lots to research, and new wonders to build and capture. This is a war scenario, with an events file that seperates the game into &quot;acts&quot;, when certain conditions are met. if you like Star Trek, or a very challenging game, you will love this one.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Feb 17, 2001, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx to John for the post.<br />
<br />
Thanx to Alcibiaties of Athenae for his help in ardous testing sessions. Well he has already posted most of what I was going to say all so I guess I am too late. In addition:<br />
<br />
To everyone who has played STBAQ, the screen shot looks like more of the same but STDW is very different. BAQ was first and foremost a civilisation building game, something akin to a mod pack. DW is a true scenario and takes place over two years or so only. So there are no settlers and colonisation. Instead, the scenario is events intensive and there will be plenty of quests and large scale battles all the way from day 1.<br />
<br />
We are almost finished with our beta testing and STDW should be released in about two weeks time or so.<br />
<br />
By the way, after I am finished, I plan to update ST:BAQ to version 2.1 using some of the improved graphics from STDW so if you have anything that you would want to see done to BAQ (that doesn't take too much work), please just post it here.<br />
