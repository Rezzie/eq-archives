I have played and done well at the other Sid products. After reading many other posts, I have noticed that many of the &quot;improvements&quot; in CivIII are just leeched off of the other products. Lets look at the new improvements to CivIII.<br />
<br />
National Borders -- Call to Power 2 had these.<br />
Culture -- Ok.<br />
Artillery Aim -- Call to Power 2 did this.<br />
Unitless trade -- Started in C2P<br />
Diplomacy Interface -- Started in SMAC<br />
Bombers/Interceptor -- New/Doesnt work properly.<br />
Resources/Luxurt -- Started in C2P.<br />
Workers -- Kinda new. Started in C2P as production points.<br />
<br />
What else has CivIII actually added that hasnt been done in a previous Sid game?<br />

To be fair, this was not intended as a revolutionary design.<br />
<br />
At the risk of sounding like a fanboy, I must say a lot of features are as advertised.<br />
<br />
They didn't say they were remaking civ, just improve a bit on it.  Personally, for a guy who didn't buy the activision crap, these new improvements are actually pretty cool.<br />
<br />
If they would just fix Airsuperiority and the goddamn galley sinking my battleship issue, I would complain a whole lot less.<br />
<br />
That said, the diplomatic options seems to be skimped an cut back as was the UN.  Otherwise, I would say it was a pretty good game concept.<br />
<br />
However I want patch! NOW!.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pggar</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 11:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that Artillery Aim and Resources/Luxuries were ideas already implemented in the CTP series. However, IIRC, resources in CTP were part of the crappy trade system. They were not needed to enhance happiness or produce units.<br />
<br />
Also, I can't see the connection between workers and the PW system that you pointed out. Workers are not a new thing. The designers just changed the settler functions, that now can only settle.<br />
<br />
As I said before, CTP trade system was crappy. Those caravan and trade routes were weird, and your options were minimal. I do think the diplomacy/trade interface was an improvement, but as you said it was started in SMAC, and they forgot to implement lots of options.<br />
<br />
The culture/borders system is a new feature, and it has nothing to do with CTP gigantically huge cities. Now if they fix the bug in which other civs enter in your land without an right of passage agreement, this will be the first empire building game to really implement a border system.<br />
<br />
At last, i think leaders are a new thing, at least I never saw them on other TBS games.</div></div><hr />

soon... <br />
As soon as they release the scenario editor and all rules are included in the editor. Till there, it is not that much of an innovation. :D</div></div><hr />

National Borders -- Call to Power 2 had these.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's from AC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Culture -- Ok.<br />
Artillery Aim -- Call to Power 2 did this.<br />
<br />
<br />
AC too.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Workers are from AC too.<br />
<br />
<br />
What else has CivIII actually added that hasnt been done in a previous Sid game?<br />
<br />
<br />
Nationality =&gt; resisters, unhappiness caused by war toward the mother country, risk of cities revolting to go back their previous civ, ethnical purification (not a decent thing, but a new one).<br />
<br />
Armies &amp; leaders =&gt; I think it add nothing to the game and that it sucks, but it's new anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LeSphinx</div><div class="date">Nov 28, 2001, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me, the most important imporvement are:<br />
- culture<br />
- leader<br />
- small wonder concept<br />
- many way of winning<br />
- trade system<br />
- diplomacy system (more interesting than in SMAC)<br />
<br />
The reference with CTP II is not true.<br />
The borders system have been implemented in SMAC and SMAC was release before CTP II.<br />
<br />
For me, CTP II is an imitation of a famous game.<br />
<br />
I bought everything: Civ I , Civ II, Civ III, SMAC, CTP and CTP II.<br />
I sold CTP and CTP II because people there takes the fixaris product and adapt it! That is all !<br />

<br />
The diplomacy system better than SMAC??? You gotta be the biggest smoocher I've seen yet! Many ways of winning... well. Lets talk about that.<br />
<br />
1.) SMAC -- Diplomatic Victory. Planet Hugging Victory. Conquest Victory.<br />
2.) Trade system isnt all that new. Its been implimented in other games in similar fashions. The &quot;Unit&quot; trader was something that was Civ specific, but now Civ has joined the  countless other games that use Diplomacy screen for trade.<br />
<br />
I am not saying CivIII is bad. I am simply stating that it is not very originial. The graphic engine was implimented in CTP, national boundaries in SMAC... I really liked the concept of Air Power... but they released the game with it broke, which is REALLY dissapointing.<br />

<br />
The council options added many facets to the diplomacy by requesting voting on certain issues and the use of WMD, nerve stapling among many others.<br />
<br />
In Civ 3, you don't get to pick to honor alliances or not.  You don't have a many options in diplomacy (trade, go to war, sign peace treaty).<br />
<br />
One step forwards, one step back.... *sigh*.</div></div><hr />

In fact, you, and most of us, have probably played the old civs for many years. Civ has always been the same, just a new make-over with each new release. If you wanted a new strategy game, try Europa-Universalis. That is a great game, much more of a strategy-over-skill game in my opinion (where as civs are vise-versa).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 2 are different games.  EU is much more restrictive in what you can and can't do.  <br />
<br />
It just doesn't have the great &quot;sandbox&quot; feel that Civ has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ironfang</div><div class="date">Nov 28, 2001, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess the one point I failed to point out, is what Sid and the clan really wanted.<br />
<br />
They never intended CivIII to be indepth or complex. They tried to keep the hard core civ fans by making it similar to CivII... but their real target audiance is the people who are NOT very hard core in strategy gaming.<br />
<br />
So that would explain why CivIII is a very water-downed/weak version of several other games that non-strategy gamers just couldnt get into and enjoy because of the complexity. Everyone should admit, with the reduced options, making decisions arent very difficult.<br />
<br />
I mean, lets be honest. Diplomacy in CivIII is very shallow. You start out at &quot;Peace&quot; and then can create only three other forms of agreements &quot;Right of Passage&quot; (which is broke), Mutual Protection Pact (which the AI signs without regard to who they are signing it with), Military Alliance Against.<br />
<br />
I prefer more options, but that is a matter of preference. If I want an indepth game, CivIII isnt it. I won my first game, and have found every other CivIII game after just tooo laborious and monotinous. Their may be &quot;endless&quot; play possibilities because of random maps... but in all honesty... its not really all that random and replayable. Its rather boring now, especially since most of the features dont perform as they should (Right of Passage... AI doesnt care any which way).<br />

Hello! I have played EU too, as well as Civ3. I'd like to point out EU is limiting on certain commands where they are obvious in Civ3. BUT, Civ3 has much fewer detail into the organization of a country, as itself takes on the role of the &quot;over-seer&quot; of the entire world. <br />
<br />
You are right. They are two different games with different aims at trying to please the customer, just depends on one's own fancy. <br />
<br />
p,s- what is a sandbox game???</div></div><hr />

<br />
My personal fancy is the overseer approach.<br />
<br />
With respect to the sandbox concept, it is much like what kids do in the sandbox.  They dig holes, build sandcastles and smash them down to start all over.  Their isn't depth in details or rigourous conformity to reality.  It is just free play.<br />
<br />
EU on the other hand if you are going to use the same analogy would be instead of a sandbox, going to a school and doing a project of how do design buildings where they tell you to design the insides, elementary design concepts, what material to use, etc.  There is huge amounts of detail in depth and forces conformity on many issues and simply allowing one to wiggle around.  Its more like a simulator.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">knowltok</div><div class="date">Nov 28, 2001, 01:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">EU was a good game.  I am looking forward to EU2 and plan to wait for my wife to get it for me for Xmas.  It is definately a game for true strategy game fans.  What I'd like to see is the same type of game done for the twentieth century.  I love games about WWII, but they get old in a hurry because there is only so far you can go because of sticking to reality.  But, start a game at 1900 and then all kinds of possibilities open up.  Especially if you could MP it.  That I'd like to see.</div></div><hr />
