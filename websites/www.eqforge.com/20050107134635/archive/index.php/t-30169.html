<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apollo</div><div class="date">Aug 19, 2002, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My parents recently switched to WinXP on our home computer, followed by new CD burning software: Roxio Easy CD Creator 5.  Now whenever the computer starts up a window for the Roxio Project Selector automatically comes up even though it is not in the Startup list in the Start Menu.  I can't find any option in the software to disable this, and since I didn't install it I don't know if there was a way during installation to disable it.  Do any of you have a suggestion to keep this from coming up every time the computer is turned on?  I seem to remember some way to do it in Windows 2000, but don't remember where it was located, and this is a different version of Windows.</div></div><hr />

Pointing back to this thread where near the bottom starlifter did a big thing about that: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=30042 <br />

Thanks!  I saw that thread but didn't read it since I thought it was only about virus protection.  Maybe all this info on registry editing could be put in another &quot;HOWTO&quot; thread.  I bet it would be helpful to a lot of people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 20, 2002, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WARNING:  EZ CD Creator does some things to your system that the average user cannot correct, even it you uninstall it!!!!<br />
<br />
Your system will be less stable if EZ CD Creator has EVER been installed on your machine, unless you take certain steps to undo the mess it causes.  You will be cursing other programs even months down the road, when the source of the problems is this program.<br />
<br />
<br />
What EZ CD C does is put some .DLLs in your System (or System32) directory, and these are registered and used by the MS OS... problem is that they conflict with other programs, especially CD ROM writing programs and things dealing with disk access.<br />
<br />
It is too technical to explain how and what to do by hand-editing the registry to nullify the collateral damage that EZ CD can cause, but the good news is that there is a program that will identify the DLLs on your system that conflict with CD writing.  It is a program called Feurio, www.feurio.com .<br />
<br />
Feurio does not alter ASPI, or install any DLLs in your system, and is safe to use with all other programs (So is Nero, Padus Diskjuggler, and CDRWin).  But the thing that is really handy in Feurio is the pull-down menu:  Extras --&gt;  System Diagnosis .  This will root out Adaptec EZ CD C (EZ CD C is now separated form Adaptec, and called Roxio), and allow you to nullify the damaging DLLs.  When you reboot, they can no longer harm other system operations and other programs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, Feurio is shareware, and free to run their outstanding system diagnosis.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For CD writing, I cannot overemphasize that people should not run Adaptec/Roxio EZ CD Creator.  It is hostile to all other forms of life. If you have it, uninstall it and check your system with Feurio.  Personally, I run Nero for most CD writing, and also CDRwin.  Overall, Nero is the best.  But Feurio has by far the best system help and diagnosis.<br />

 Maybe all this info on registry editing could be put in another &quot;HOWTO&quot; thread.  <br />
That's a good idea.  :)</div></div><hr />

There you can disable any prog that runs when you boot.  Great for that ECDC pain.</div></div><hr />

Aaah msconfig, the best thing i ever discovered! Byebye 'savenow' installer!!<br />
<br />
Was just about to suggest it.....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 21, 2002, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For anyone that has Roxio or EZ CD Creator installed... can you run msconfig and look in win.ini and system.ini, and post if it loads any drivers through these 2 legacy files?  I don't think it does... but I don't have EZ CDC installed anymore.<br />
<br />
Then... while your EZ CDC is still installed, download and use Feurio to look at the DLL name(s) of Roxio/EZ CDC, and post those names.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not think msconfig will help with what EZ CDC does, but it has been a while since I disinfected EZ CDR from a system.  I normally do it by renaming the dll in the system directory, ot just deleting the offending DLL.  Here is the primary offending Adaptec DLL, but not necessarly the only one:<br />
<br />

<br />
Note that I did not delete this little bastard, just renamed it to the extension you see.  I have almost 2,000 files (mostly DLLs) in my Win95 System directory, and it takes a while to search.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless you are confident in navigating with Explorer, don't plow in and start deleting DLLs.  If you spot this particular file, just rename it (so you can go back, if you ever want).  Or let Fuerio do it for you (it will also check for  the newer offending DLLs).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, good luck to all that have Adaptec EZ CDC.  Get Nero instead!  Much cleaner, much more stable.  And Nero is flat out better for CD &amp; MP3 mastering.</div></div><hr />
