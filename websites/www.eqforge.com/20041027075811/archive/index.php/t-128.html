In the largest of cases, in a late game switch to Fundamentalism I've been able to put a decent army of about 40+ howitzers on a continent with about half as many spies and engineers as support.  Thanks to the helpful AI tactic of building all-reaching rail lines, that's really all one would need to take over the continent in a single turn - annoying partisans included.<br />
<br />
In a regualar game, I find a smaller combination of howitzers, battleships and stealth fighters (with spies, engineers and transports) are about what I need to take the world in a reasonable time.  They can be pretty mobile and go from continent to continent pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
I imagine the early militaristic would be more inclined to have tremendous amounts of units - elephants, chariots, crusaders, ironclads and the like.  I guess the thought there is that they will likely lose some units as they progress - at least more so when compared to the howitzer/battleship/stealth fighter combo.<br />

<br />
I tend not to focus on air power unless the enemy has planes. If they don't I'll 2-3 bombers and 3-4 stealth fighters. <br />

I'll have 1-2 battleships, with Aeg cruiers, and 1 carrier, (unless the enemy is a strong naval power.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not crusaders...they cost too much!  In GOTM #1 I got the workshop, got democracy and the statue, then switched to fundy before researching chivalry.  When I was getting close to chivalry, I set my science rate down to 10% and bought horsemen (let city build a few sheilds one turn, then buy the next turn)  in about 3/4 of my cities.  Cities with production of 10 crank out every 2 turns naturally.  I did this for about 6-8 turns turns before the chivalry upgrad to Knight.  Then I cranked science back up and dumped a couple caravans on an unsuspecting Persia for the bonus to get leadership a few turns later.  It takes a bit longer than the instant crusader-&gt;dragoon upgrade, but buying 60-70 dragoons for 40 gold ain't a bad price!<br />

All the war action takes place between 1720 and 1830-ish. At the peak, my takeover of the last and largest civ around 1830, the units read like this...<br />
<br />
* 64 Howitzers<br />
* 10 Armour<br />
* 5 Artillery<br />
* 14 Mech Infantry<br />
* 99 Riflemen<br />
* 45 Alpine Troops<br />
* 55 Engineers (in the offence)<br />
* 1 Helicopter<br />
* 4 Cruisers<br />
* 4 Transport<br />
* 3 Spies<br />
<br />
20 years later (current date in game):<br />
* Howies are down to 25 as I disband them in cities,<br />
* Engineers are up to 200!<br />

However the answer to your question can be seen in the following statistics for my civ...<br />

1705 CE: just 46 cities (prior to outbreak of war)<br />
1842 CE: 126 cities (just after end of war)<br />
1854 CE: 155 cities (current game turn with 166 turns to go)<br />

I mean to break the record score and I need 255 cities to do it, the max the game will take. Actually 254 of mine + 1 pet. That means I need to settle 100 more cities in the next ten turns or so and they've all got to brought up to max as quickly as possible to ensure maximum science for maximum future tech.<br />

<br />
I'm using the Euroland map, and I have 240ish cities, and it's only 1850ish. I had that many cities since 15 hundreds. I did this by building mostly nothing by settlers for most of the beginnning, and by crushing the enemy civs quickly with dips. I also got at least 50 cities with goody huts. <br />
<br />
I have a pet city: Coventry. It has 1 defender: a phalanx. Since England is a republic the phalanx is taking up its only production, so it sucks to be them.<br />
<br />
I have 5 future techs, with 1 tech per turn.<br />

I'm in democracy, and had just begun my luxury growth. My population is only 115 million, and I almost got 500%.<br />

<br />
But I guess it's not Vlad's fault. He's merely taking advantage of a weakness in the system. We've had a separation of custom maps and other maps. As far as I'm concerned Euroland and Earth maps are custom maps - you know the layout beforehand - and they should go with the customs.<br />

It is a VERY easy map to get a high score on, for two reasons:<br />
(1) You know the layout before you start, even if you randomise starting positions. Any European who has problems with it must have flunked geography!<br />
(2) The amount of contiguous landmass on the Euro map is HUGE - even larger than real life - making it easy to wage a land war and making it very easy to build lots of good cities with good communication.<br />
<br />
Vlad, I accept your challenge, but it is low down on my list of priorities - my own random game and GOTM#2 take higher priority. And I accept it only on one condition: that you accept the counter-challenge of playing from the start position of my own game (King, 7 civs, large random archipelago, restless tribes) - a little like a GOTM.<br />

I bet most of the random map gamers reload more often than Lefty's had sex. I've noticed all of the games in the HOF with random map have beautifully large land masses. Even when I set the landmass to large, 3/5 times there's thin, stringly continents full of mountains and jungles.<br />

Ok, I give up, I could never prove it.<br />
<br />
Yeah I was speaking for myself, but at least I am honest!<br />

P.S. I should never have said all that. I should have known what the replies would have been. *DoH* Just slaps forehead!<br />

But what got to us was the sweeping generalisation. I, for one, saw what you said and thought &quot;well it doesn't apply to me, therefore it's not logically true&quot;.<br />
<br />
But maybe it does apply to some people. Though maybe, by definition, some of the people who actually care about the game and have a sense of honour are grouped here on this forum. And I believe them.<br />

<br />
One time i was playing on prince, and i had this HUGE invasion force of Marines, something like 150 and landed them on key points of the land mass the mongols were on.<br />
<br />
If you add about 50 helo's (which i did) it is a pure amfibious assult.<br />
<br />
yeah i know prince is prince, but it was 1050AD!!<br />

<br />
What I hate:<br />
When you have over (I think) 250 of a type of unit, it goes back down to 1 again in the defense advisor thing.<br />
<br />
Once, I had about 500 engineers, and it only ONE!!!!! Then I built cities so I had less than 500, and suddenly it said 248. AFter I disbanned most of them, it still said 200.<br />

Just as a matter of interest, I would like to make a thread about army sizes.<br />
<br />
Can you please leave details of the largest army that you recal building. It doesn't have to be specific. Just roughly what type of units you had, roughly how many and what you did with them.<br />
<br />

i have built a large army in a one player and had at least 1000 units and the game was still far from over.  i am one of the greatest players in the lands.</div></div><hr />

I do and that is why there is practically nothing left of those terrain types!!! There once was a pretty large dessert on one of the islands, but not really any tundra!!<br />

But you are right about the land formation!!! When ever I create new maps now there are quite a few small strips of land that often have some stupid terrain type on it!! I don't know if that is because both of my two high score games are originally from Civ2 classic!!!<br />
