<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strategy Man</div><div class="date">Dec 19, 2001, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh boy, gee whiz!  The current GOTM's are just swell. :cool: <br />
<br />
It just seems like very early conquerization of the world always ranks highest, though.  So...create some situations where it wouldn't work!<br />
<br />
Here's some swell ideas...<br />
<br />
* Start the game after giving a handicapped amount of turns &lt;i.e. save the starting game after you've wasted 5-10 turns, thus not starting your game at 4,000 BC<br />
<br />
* Actually put down the city starting location.  You could handicap the player by putting a capital at the tip of a continent and not the ideal location...<br />
<br />
* Island maps!  Oh boy, these stop ancient conquerization.<br />
<br />
These might be interesting ideas to give the space, culture, and diplomacy a chance to be on the top rankings, without making the game a &quot;giant&quot; map, or &quot;diety&quot; settings :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the first GOTM it was very easy to have an early conquest given the location, the map size and the Immortals. And I think that this month a lot of people won't have had the ability to conquer the world fast (like me :().</div></div><hr />

I am 2 techs away from the modern age and i can take the last city.</div></div><hr />
