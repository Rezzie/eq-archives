<br />
For example, I can always count on my pals the Mongols having a ridiculously large army of obselete units, as their science lags pathetically far behind everyone elses. Whenever a Zulu unit parks itself behind mine, I can expect a &quot;Sneak Attack by %string1 forces&quot; message.&quot;<br />
<br />
Those things have to do with their characteristics, so what I'm more interested in is how the AI fares against you.<br />
<br />
I consider the English, Romans, and Carthiginians to be most worthy of my time. And when the Babylonians are playing I can forsee an easy takeover. Anyway, enough rambling. What does everyone else think?<br />

Indians<br />

These civs arent in any particular order but my favorite three are English,Russian and Indian http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
I usally play as the Americans, but my second preferance to play as is the English, in which case I usually put the Americans in the game, (knowing that they will probably be absent by the end).<br />

<br />
I'll meet them, establish a reasonably good relationship... then they'll come out and make ridiculous demands (that of course I'll refuse) and we'll go to war.<br />
<br />
So I'll trounce them thoroughly and they'll grudgingly become neutral.  No matter what I do after that, I can't win them back to liking me.<br />

<br />
I find that the French, English, Zulus, Romans, and the Spanish to be the most powerful. <br />
<br />
The Spanish are usually really rich and has lots of cities. <br />
<br />
Zulus cover their land with irrigation and roads, and has lots of units. <br />
<br />
French and English are both good, but the French are better.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 04, 2001, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some observations:<br />
<br />
Mongols and Sioux seem to have similar militaristic tendencies.  Sioux don't expand as well though.  Russians seem to try to put up a good fight, but I have always managed to catch them pretty early.<br />
<br />
Japanese have always gotten crappy terrain when I played them, so they were a non-factor.<br />
<br />
The most cities I've seen the aztecs build is 4, I think.<br />
<br />
The persians seem to have about 8-10 large cities, defended by a couple phalanxes and archers.<br />
<br />
Americans build these huge cities that are so-o-o-o-o nice to take http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<br />
Well, I once developped a large civ next to a well hidden-one (the Aztecs) which had around 15 cities most above size 12 and culminating at 32 ! The 32 fell first, of course...</div></div><hr />

MicroProse is an American Company! Wow! <br />
<br />
ok j/k<br />
<br />
I find the Egyptians to be quite sensible. I mean, they dun invade other ppl's land for no reasons, they keep to their treaties most of the time and is pretty good at developing science and advance units. Too bad they are the 2nd most advance civ in my game. I'll have to wipe them out just because of that. They are a direct threat to our national interest. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thealien_83</div><div class="date">May 06, 2001, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find that it actually varies somewhat from time to time, how the computer acts, but that is probably due to the fact that every game is bound to progress differently than the last one. As for Civ's I myself like or dislike, well...<br />
<br />
 The Russians, Mongols, Spanish, Zulus &amp; Japanese tend to always end up as my mortal enemies whenever they are present. They always have huge armies and bite after more than they can swallow, generally my whole empire...<br />
<br />
 Civ's I tend to get along *better* with ( that is to say only OCCASIONAL meaningless wars isntead of permanent ones ) are the Babylonians, Chinese, Americans, Egyptians &amp; Romans. Frankly, that's the case.<br />
<br />
 Though I either tend to random the enemy AI's or choose Civ's who historically go together, such as picking the &quot;English, Spanish, French &amp; Russian&quot; or &quot;Greek, Persian, Egyptian, Babylonian &amp; Roman&quot; and so on...</div></div><hr />
