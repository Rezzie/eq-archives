<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2003, 07:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the time before time, when no men walked the Earth and the glory of Noshuret was not yet even a dream, the Spirits existed in isolation.  There were many of these Spirits, but only a few stood out from the crowd.  They were the Great Spirits, and they decided to create a planet and race to accompany them through time.  Terra, the Earth Spiritess, made a ball of dirt with her hands and in so doing created the Earth.  Pyra, her eldest son, punched holes in the ball with his stylus and created the mighty volcanoes, which spread molten rock across the planet and created the landscape.  Aqua, his younger brother, shed a tear on the ball of rock and created the vast oceans, and the rain.  Aria, the beautiful daughter of Terra, breathed on the planet and created the sky and the wind.  When all this was done, the King of the Spirits, Alpha, created the men and the beasts which today wonder the Earth.  He blessed one particular tribe of Men, the Fanaticans, with the knowledge of His Truth, and bid them that they carry His word around the world.  And so it was that the first Temple of the Spirits was founded in Noshuret under the stewardship of the High Priests of the Alphian Order.  They called to the people of Fanatica to come and worship, and be cleansed of their sins.  They offered food to the hungry, drink to the thirsty, and salvation and enlightenment to all.  In the Temple they set up a series of 100 stained glass windows going all the way around the circular building depicting and explaining the entire pantheon of Spirits.<br />

McNultus: I knew from the wise Octavian X the majesty of the Spirits, but to see their works so displayed is wondrous indeed. <br />
(looks at a stained glass window depicting Pyra) and to thee Pyra, I pledge my axe once again. If there is a need, I will not be slow to answer it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it is truly great to see such a gathering of believers.  Let us preach to the people of Fanatica of Spiritualism!</div></div><hr />

Hello, I come to declare my allegiance to this religion. I see it right, for it is the Truth. I shall serve it to the day I die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarn</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I, Lord Jedi Master Zarn of the Jedi Council, ask for a common respect between Spiritualism and Jediism. I have nothing against the people that devout themselves to Spiritualism. So, I hope we can have a peaceful relationship.</div></div><hr />

After all, we are all Alpha's children, whether we decide to acknowledge Him or not.  I welcome ye, Jedi.  May our friendship overcome all differences of opinion.</div></div><hr />
