Please read  this thread  (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=44819&amp;perpage=20&amp;display=show&amp;pagenumber=2) before voting<br />
There was much discussion about a way to add some internal conflict/interest in the game to spice it up a bit.  Several different ideas were floated.  It is important to read the posts and understand the ideas before voting, as the simple one line explanations do not do justice to the ideas suggested and discussed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Talar</div><div class="date">Feb 27, 2003, 06:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe the poll should have been multiple-choice. I would for example like to vote for both #1 and #6 Also several options are very similar, splitting up the votes of the people who want to play with regions/islands on minor detail issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Feb 27, 2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was a difficult subject to pull together into a poll, and I had rather limited time to think through all the issues carefully.  That's why I had hoped somebody else might jump in and do the poll ;)  Feel free to suggest other options/combinations.  We can re-poll if necessary, although the low turnout in general here would seem to indicate little interest in this concept overall.  Unless that changes in the next couple days, I would suggest forgetting this whole idea.  I'll be gone over the weekend, so somebody else may need to make that determination.</div></div><hr />
