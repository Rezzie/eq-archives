I have a scenario in mind and want to create a realistic map of the area. First, how do you go about drawing coastlines that are rounded? The little squares don't seem to cut it. Second, is there any place on the web where you can get good maps to copy from, ones that are large enough to see what you need, yet small enough to download. I have found some, but they are fairly small and not too detailed. Thanks for your advice, happy civing! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/ninja1.gif<br />

First...it's not cut and paste.  So you can't take parts you like.  Second....you cen't get a lot of detail, because the squares are squares.  Third....the coastlines aren't that bad.. <br />
Anyway...<br />
