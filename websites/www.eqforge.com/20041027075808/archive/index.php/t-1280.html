<br />
Even if i never had finished a game (there's surely grammar problems in this phrase...<br />
http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/lol.gif) I always enjoy... Civ-Life, Mars Now, Master of Magic, of Orion, Age of reptiles, Bears at play, Santa is coming, i had also appreciated The New World. But, personnaly, I don't lika a scenario that doesn't change almost all graphics...http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/angry.gif<br />

Mars NOW! is my absolute favorite of the FW scenarios. The Age of Reptiles is a lot of fun...I was going to convert it to a playable modpack for Classic Civ II players. Then again, I like a lot of scenarios available here at civfanatics...too numerous to mention...<br />
<br />
If you liked the Mars now scenario, try my Lunar scenario its similar...I have a playtest of my Antarctic I am posting...perhaps you might want to try that one too...or first even!<br />

<br />
I tried to download scenarios, but, because of my complicated situation of computers, I hadn't be able to play them yet, possibly in Multiplayer?<br />

<br />
If you are asking if these scenarios can be played on multiplayer I believe so...also, perhaps... <br />
<br />
if you have ICQ, I know there are people who get files that way...or then again there is alway Email if you can receive attachements...<br />

<br />
Some scenarios might fit on a floppy though like my Water World scenario...hm...let me check...yep it does...but it sounds like you have a computer thing happening...that's ok...I've been there<br />
<br />
I also forgot to mention that I like the &quot;Atlantis Scenario&quot;...that one was pretty good too.<br />

That's nice for multiplayer Civ II, AoE, AoK, GP3, FIFA 2001, etc.<br />
That way, I can download things from this computer and copy them to the computer in my room.<br />
