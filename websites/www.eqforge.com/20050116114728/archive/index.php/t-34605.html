<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 20, 2002, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Recently a friend of mine bought a new sound card to replace his Isis... He purchased a Philips Acoustic Edge. I heard the sound on Philips speakers and Altec Lansing... well, now I just really can't understand why people stick with stinky sound blasters. Even the SB Live is no match. Actually I could remember the Gravis Ultrasound, a long time ago. It was much better than the AWE 32 and used less processor ressources than the SB but like Microsoft, Creative Labs had a too good marketing machine :( Then it died. Hope that won't happen for those Philips Edge series for they're really outstanding. I'm not advertising for them, of course, but I would recommend you to give that brand a chance, you won't be disappointed. Btw, if you find the accoustic edge too expensive (€90) then you can always try the seismic edge 5.1. They can be found at €40 and are practically equal to the acoustic edge. Plus, their drivers are very stable, contrary to certain models of SB Live ;) But well, since people are dumb ;) I'm sure I'm talking to deafs and everybody will still buy SB... Bah I don't care too much, it's not my problem :)<br />
<br />
PS: I've just checked some hardware sites and seems that they too, agree that Philips Edge series are the best.<br />
PS: Yes I know, there will be always somebody to argue with what I say. I have a clue about who :D</div></div><hr />

I haven't heard of it until you posted this thread. Nothing in the hardware magazine Maximum PC unless I missed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Oct 21, 2002, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll agree that soundblasters are not the greatest pieces of equipment and the Philips series sounds nice....but I don't really care much about how nice my sound is except for on my gaming machine which has an SB live(although I'm looking for something WAY nicer)<br />
<br />
Please do provide links to the hardware review sites, as I may seriously consider buying one of these products :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 22, 2002, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks guys for your interests. I wouldn't have expected my words would meet such echoes. Right.<br />
http://www.digit-life.com/articles/philipsae/<br />
http://www.techspot.com/reviews/hardware/acousticedge/index.shtml<br />
<br />
But there're also the Philips homepage (www.pcsound.philips.com/acoustic.html ).<br />
<br />
And just type Philips Edge in the Google engine :)<br />
<br />
Trust me, get even the Seismic Edge you won't blame me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Oct 22, 2002, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm thinking about a seismic edge, in fact..I'll buy one!<br />
<br />
I'll even get new speakers and a new subwoofer while I'm at it ;)<br />
<br />
Ooohhhhh.........this is gonna sound good :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 23, 2002, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know what? I bought one seismic edge too! for €39.9.<br />
The seller was so pleased that another person knew those cards were best so we talked for 10 mins, while the custommers were getting impatient, lol :)<br />
We talked about the fact that he was quite sad, trying to advertise for Philips cards, and nobody will listen to him</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Oct 25, 2002, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">4 seismic edges and an acoustic edge, a complete upgrade of my downstairs LAN machines: TIME FOR A LAN PARTY!!!! I need to show off my sound..quickly!<br />
<br />
Ohhh man....mp3s encoded to 256 Kb/s sound like a dream on these things :) Not to mention all the sound effects in counterstrike :D<br />
<br />
EVEN THE FREAKING CIV3 MUSIC IS TOLERABLE!!! :D :D <br />
<br />
THANK YOU GENGHISK!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 26, 2002, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">5 Philips! lol. Very expensive then...<br />
You live in UK, don't you? I'm pleased you could find those cards easily in the stores. Good then, it means finally resellers are discovering these great things little by little.<br />
<br />
PS: no need to thank me, a €500 not would do ;)<br />
Seriously, glad I could help some people. A smile from Gonzo is worth millions € :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy76</div><div class="date">Oct 26, 2002, 05:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">gonzo lives in Mid-west America...not UK.<br />
GK, it sure sounds like you have made a convert out of gonzo! I am happy with my original SB Live!. I don't go for those fancy smancy 5.1 sound effects for my games. I have enough wires and junk to worry about. I am not about to have speakers behind me for my cats or dogs to knock down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rheinmetall</div><div class="date">Jan 22, 2003, 02:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's been some time I last saw this thread and decided to kick it back up. It made me to try and buy a Seismic edge card and I'm glad it did. The difference to my onboard sound(AC97) is noticeable (Bass is deeper, sound is clearer) even with basic 50€ speakers, not to mention headphones. My brother bought one too to replace his SB AWE64 ISA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Jan 22, 2003, 08:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yop yop, a second &quot;victim&quot; on my gun grip ;)<br />
Well, actually the most amazing difference between a classi onboard chip (generally C-Media chip) is the Midi emulation. The Philips can make a midi track sound almost like a cd quality music.. There are several drawbacks though.<br />
_ the latest drivers seem to crash windows 2000 each time I reboot or shut down! weird. But it's not too annoying since there's a reset button ;)<br />
_ be careful, VERY careful when downloading drivers update on the Philips main homepage, the drivers have virus! Check my thread somewhere in this forum too.. I have warned you.<br />
_ if you set the philips control panel to its default, it will allow the sound card to take up to 70% of the processor resources to render realistic and surround sound. ok I admit the quality is amazing but 70% might look a bit too much, even for such a quality.. So the choice is yours, you can take it down to 30% without loosing a noticeable quality :) Trust me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeratain</div><div class="date">Jan 22, 2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm very happy with my Creative Audigy 2 soundcard. I get pure digital sound out of my new 5.1 speakers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Jan 22, 2003, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Creative cards aren't bad, and an Audigy 2 is actually rather nice. But I'll take my Phillips. I actually managed to convert a few friends. :D<br />
<br />
And I'll agree w/GK, the MIDI emulation is absolutely superior to Creative's cards. If you aren't doing anything, jack those resources up to 70% and listen to some music, ahh............<br />
<br />
It's also the first card I can hear a difference between mp3's encoded with a bitrate of 256 and those encoded higher :D</div></div><hr />
