(Pitchers and catchers report on the 18th of February). I'm very antsy for the season to start so with the rosters pretty much set, so I thought I would go ahead and make my annual predictions on the upcoming season.<br />
<br />
AL East<br />
Boston finally beats New York just barely in the division race. The Yankees win the wildcard.<br />
1.Boston<br />
2.NYY<br />
3.Toronto<br />
4.Baltimore<br />
5.Tampa Bay<br />
<br />
AL Central<br />
This is the weakest division in baseball and is pretty up in the air.<br />
1.White Sox<br />
2.Minnesota<br />
3.Kansas City<br />
4.Cleveland<br />
5.Detroit<br />
<br />
AL West<br />
This is a very competitive division but a lack of offense from Seattle and Oakland means Anaheim edges them out.<br />
1.Anaheim<br />
2.Oakland<br />
3.Seattle<br />
4.Texas<br />
<br />
AL MVP-Gary Sheffield<br />
AL Cy Young-Pedro Martinez<br />
AL ROY- Joe Mauer (Minnesota)<br />
<br />
NL East<br />
After 12 year on top the Braves finally lose the division.<br />
1.Philadelphia<br />
2.Florida<br />
3.Atlanta<br />
4.NY Mets<br />
5.Montreal<br />
<br />
NL Central<br />
This is a race between Houston and Chicago. The Cubs manage to win the central for the second year in a row. Houston wins the wild card.<br />
1.Cubs<br />
2.Houston<br />
3.St. Louis<br />
4.Pittsburgh<br />
5.Cincinnati<br />
6.Milwaukee<br />
<br />
NL West<br />
This division is not what it was in the past few years. The Giants are able to get career years from many players around Barry Bonds to propel them to first in the division.<br />
1.San Francisco<br />
2.San Diego<br />
3.Los Angeles<br />
4.Arizona<br />
5.Colorado<br />
<br />
NL MVP- Jim Thome<br />
NL Cy Young-Mark Prior<br />
NL ROY-Edwin Jackson (Los Angeles)<br />
<br />
2004 World Series<br />
Chicago Cubs over New York Yankees<br />
<br />
These are my predictions, but don't take them too seriously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just hope the Jays make progress.. and find some way to keep Carlos Delgado. It might be too much to hope that they can overtake Boston or the Yanks, but I do know they'll beat Baltimore and their retread free agent signees...</div></div><hr />

I forgot Edwin Jackson's name when I first made this post, so I arbitrarily picked Khalil Green because I remembered his name at that moment. Even before you posted this I decided to change my ROY prediction to Jackson.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Houston has some sticks, too. Cubs might come back to the pack a little bit, bu they have bolstered their pen. These two will fight it out for the Central all year long. Doesn't it always look like the Beaneaters will overtake the Yanks, just to fall flat? Here's to hoping my poor Tribe can crack .500, they do have some nice young arms.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kubz</div><div class="date">Feb 14, 2004, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This A-Rod to the Yankees deal is totally excessive. This is not good for the future of baseball at all. If I was a fan of a small market team, which constitute about 75% of the markets I would seriously consider giving up MLB, becuse they don't have a chance even before the season started. I'm am so sick and tired of seeing the Yankees in the World Series nearly every year. I was so pleased to see them fail the last 3 years but now with a payroll of nearly 200 million dollars, I don't see how the Yankees won't make the World Series every year for the foreseeable future. If they falter again to a smaller market team Georgie will just sign more and more superstars to excessive contracts like its nothing.This is a travesty to fairness and competitiveness in the league. It doesn't seem possible that the players union and the owners will agree to a salary cap or expanded revenue sharing. They need to agree or MLB will be in serious jeopardy in the near future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Togo</div><div class="date">Feb 15, 2004, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But it was ok when Boston was going to get him, right (or that they got Schilling?)? And no, %75 of teams are not small market. Going on TV market size, there are 6 truely &quot;large market&quot; teams, 14 medium market teams, and 10 small market teams. <br />
<br />
The Yankees payroll will not be much different from what it was last year, but I would guess no one bothered to do the math. Its so much fun to just throw out numbers like 75% and 200 million, whether they are true or not.<br />
<br />
Let me all just remind you thast the Yankees are not the ones setting the market. They did not sign ARod to that ridiculous contract. They also happen to be the largest draw in baseball, and they account for around 60% of all merchandise sold. <br />
<br />
The Yankees make more money for baseball than any other team. How is that bad for the sport? Owners like Tom Hicks are what's wrong with baseball. A salary cap is not what is needed. Fiscal responsibility and investment in the teams by their owners is what is needed. Maybe if they learned to spend their money better, and weren't just pocketing it, there would be more equality in baseball.<br />
<br />
But then again, I guess its just easier to blame the Yankees instead of dealing with the real problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, let us all just forget the fact that Soriano was the player traded for ARod.  Completely unfair.<br />
<br />
Yes, lets ask the Yankees, the highest revenue team in the sport, to share even more of their money with other owners who just want to pocket it.<br />
<br />
And yes, MLB is in serious jeopardy, as it was during its supposed golden age of the 40's and 50' when the Yankees won nearly every year (and when baseball didn't come close to drawing the numbers it does today), right? We'll just foget that the last 4 World Series had a different winner, only one of them being the Yankees.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">General Porkins</div><div class="date">Feb 15, 2004, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GAAAHHHHH!!! oh how i lament the fact that a-rod couldnt get his contract restructured for the boston deal (not to mention we would have been rid of that lousy overpaid ramirez).  at least the yanks lost petit and clemens...<br />
<br />
and honestly, how many here think this has anything to do with that commercial with jeter and a-rod in it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kubz</div><div class="date">Feb 15, 2004, 09:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">200 Million is pretty close to the payroll. Just about every baseball fan of any team other than the Yankees agree that this trade is a sign of what is wrong in baseball, and they will blame the Yankees. Everyone is sick of seeing the Yankees there every single year.<br />
But now that I've thought about it you can't blame the Yankees, if my G.M. spent like that I would probably feel differently. Its not the Yankees fault its the structure of the game. I'm a Cubs fan and my team is one of the &quot;large&quot; market team and our payroll is 90 million which is a lot compared to most teams; the Yankees are about double that, however. The Yankees have a payroll nearly seven times that of some small market teams, and have 6 of the most expensive 12 salaried players on their team. The rich just keep on getting richer. The A's and the Marlins proved that a small market team can be competetive, but every year the Yankees lose they simply buy more mercenaries. It will get to the point where small market teams will never compete. A salary cap and expanded revenue sharing would make the game so much better. <br />
<br />
And its not just A-Rod, its also Gary Sheffield, Javier Vazquez, Kevin Brown, Jason Giambi, Mike Mussina, and others.<br />
Alfonso Soriano isn't even close to A-Rod. Soriano might be an elite player in fantasy baseball, but in real life his putrid plate discipline lowers his value immensely. Besides the Yankees will undoubtedly just trade for another elite palyer such as Jose Vidro to cover 2nd base.<br />
<br />
I feel, and and sure many other non-Yankee baseball fans agree that it is going to far. It is like like when my high school football team would beatup on teams with a fourth of my school's enrollment. The score would be 35-3, but what was the point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">General Porkins</div><div class="date">Feb 15, 2004, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the problem isnt the yankees, its in the system of free-agency and greedy players trying to scratch out and extra 10 million that they desperately need to keep up payments on their 3 mansions and 57 fantasy automobiles.  there is no more loyalty to teams now, and everone wants out for more cash.  it has become nearly impossible to 'build' a competitive team as the players just leave for a better contract after a few years.  tony gwynn and cal ripkin jr were the last of a dying breed of players loyal to their teams, and baseball is much worse off without men of their caliber.  the owners aren't any better either, cutting pay-rolls by selling off their top players to increase their revenue, only to pocket the money instead of using it to bring in new, young talent.</div></div><hr />

I'm not buying that report. He turned down the chance to pitch here a decade ago, he doesn't like New York. Its not really being widely reported here, either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ouch, the Atlanta station WSB is reporting that Maddux has signed with the Yankees. I don't know if this is real, but if it is I'm very upset as a Cub's fan. Are they going to make him pitch middle relief?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">General Porkins</div><div class="date">Feb 17, 2004, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">maybe they will keep him in the starting rotation and try to trade contreras or brown for a lefty (randy johnson perhaps?) <br />
but seriously...they dont have a southpaw in their rotation.  itll be interesting to see how they fix that problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke Togo</div><div class="date">Feb 17, 2004, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yankees GM Brian Cashman said there was no truth to the report, NO discussions with Maddux have taken place.

<br />
Your right. It looks like he will sign with my Cubs. The whole Maddux to the Yankees thing is completely false. It was obviously a ruse perpetrated by Maddux's agent Scott Boras to incite the Cubs G.M. to get nervous and raise his offer. Earlier today it was even being reported by ESPN that Maddux was indeed going to sign with the Yankees, but that proved to be false. Worried me for a moment, but welcome back Maddog!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thestonesfan</div><div class="date">Feb 18, 2004, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this is going to be an awesome season. The Yanks/Sox rivalry will reach the most intense proportions seen in American professional sports. A-Rod(and Jeter) will have an extraordinary amount of pressure on him to put up some big numbers. Let's face it, in Texas, no one cared how he did. It will all boil down to how he handles the pressure.<br />
<br />
And can the Yankee clubhouse handle yet another prima donna?<br />
<br />
Also, let's not forget how good Soriano is - plus, he has postseason experience, something A-Rod doesn't have. I look for the Rangers to start competing in a year or two.<br />
<br />
How good the Red Sox do hinges on Schilling. He's old, and last season was far from his best.<br />
<br />
The Cubbies will be a force to be reckoned with. Maddux has at least few great years left, I'm sure. They will have the best pitching in the league. I'm psyched for April.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daniel Khan</div><div class="date">Feb 18, 2004, 08:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, even Cubs and Red Sox fans can be cautiously optimistic this year.</div></div><hr />

Now, if they could land a great closer, I might be even more optimistic.</div></div><hr />

Lay off the weed, stonerfan. If by competing you mean winning 82, surely possible. But the playoffs are a pipe dream. Worst pithing staff ever, a six ERA doesn't cut it in the bigs.</div></div><hr />

You mean ARod's .941 post season OPS compared to Soriano's .623? Seriously, you guys HAVE to start checking stats before you post stuff like that. As a baseball fan, this thread is almost embarrassing.</div></div><hr />
