It's a C-5 Galaxy, with a cool graphic I worked on for a while.  Unfortunately in play testing, I cannot load ground units on to the plane even though I have given it a few &quot;holds&quot; in the rules.txt file.  The unit is set as an air unit, which I guess is conflicting with the &quot;holds&quot; function.  Any ideas how to make this work?</div></div><hr />

Suggest you figure out which cominations of abilities/domain can work before starting work on your scenario to avoid disappointment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andrew Livings</div><div class="date">May 04, 2001, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're correct that the air unit domain is overriding the holds ability. The only way this kind of unit has worked is to make them paradropping naval units to jump from city to city, but that's far from perfect and the AI will use them as ships. Nothing to stop you having them though.<br />
<br />
Look here for a guide on the units' abilities: http://civ.strategy-gaming.com/Kobyashi/SCENAR~2.shtml  <br />
<br />
Actually this would work quite well for a land-locked scenario. You can hack the save game to allow inland cities to build sea units, and deny that to costal cities. Since the AI uses paratroops in a single way (jumping into unoccupied cities) you might even see them doing that, though I doubt they'd deliberately load units in cities before air lifting them in this way. At least it would be no worse than the way the AI uses so-called &quot;aircraft carriers&quot;. I just think of a scenario where you could do this. Might be interesting for a Gulf War one.<br />
