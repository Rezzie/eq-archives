<br />
Fanatica Foreign Classification<br />
<br />
Carthage: A Carthage-esque civilization is a bitter enemy of ours. We will not stop until we destroy this civ. They are our sworn enemy, and they deserved it. They have either attacked us or done something horrible against us.<br />
<br />
Jerusalem: A Jerusalem type civilization is a civ which has become victim of our might. We take them over, sometimes without reason.<br />
<br />
Gaul: A long term enemy. Similar to a Carthage, but this involves advance plans with multiple fronts and a larger amounts of units. We may not necessarily destroy this civ.<br />
<br />
<br />
We need a temporary ally, a constant ally and a civ we are just at peace with.<br />
<br />
Names needed!!<br />
Also, discuss Abe and Cleo here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">May 17, 2003, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">does ANYONE have any intention to discuss in here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 17, 2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A temporary ally could be named Iran. (Just use 'em till we don't need 'em anymore.)<br />
<br />
A constant ally could be those cheesy colonialist we call the English. They drive on the wrong side of the road, but everything else is pretty much the same.<br />
<br />
Someone we are just at peace with would be South Africa (Safrica?). We just want them for their diamonds and other resources.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">May 17, 2003, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im going in Roman sense, Cyc. If we were to use those names, England would be a tough enemy which we are angry at for not defeating and Iran another glorious empire other then us.<br />
<br />
But... then again, Rome had no really allies....<br />
<br />
So I suppose an ally could be a &quot;Greece&quot; (someone we like) ?<br />
<br />
Heaven help us if Alex is in this game...<br />
Weve already got the makings of another Domino</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">May 18, 2003, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a Roman sense, huh...? Hmmm.<br />
<br />
How about the Vatican, Sicily, and Swiss Bankers?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Almightyjosh</div><div class="date">May 18, 2003, 03:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A temporary ally could be the etruscans.  Rome was kinda at peace with them for a while.  Then wiped em off the face of the planet.  Maybe one of the great empires of Persia could be the one we are 'just at peace with' (though obviously the name Persia would not work!).<br />
<br />
I don't know of Rome ever 'stooping' to the level of having any real allies!!<br />
<br />
EDIT: apparently the tribe known as the 'Latins' were long time allies of the Roman tribe and eventually were subsumed (is that a word?) into the empire peacefully.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">May 18, 2003, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Constant ally = the Italians.<br />
The Italian allies constituted half of Rome's army. <br />
<br />
Temporary ally = ?<br />
Rome didn't go in for temporary allies.<br />
You were either a Friend and Ally of the Roman People or you were fair game<br />
<br />
Peaceful co existence = Parthians/Sasanids<br />
Rome maintained an uneasy peace with them for many centuries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">May 18, 2003, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hm.. forgot about the Latins and the Italians.<br />
Italians- A constant ally. We just seem to like these guys. We would, normally, help them out. We get them on our side in most wars.<br />
Persians- We are yet to kill these guys. We are at peace with them, but who knows when it may break?<br />
Thanks, everyone. Now we just need to find a temp. ally name....<br />
Anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">May 18, 2003, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">edit- oops. DP. see above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">May 18, 2003, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about the Goths for temporary allies.<br />
They were given lands in exchange for service against other tribal nations.<br />
Perhaps you might consider the Greeks in place of Jersusalem for your 'overcome by might catergory'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">May 18, 2003, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@Peri- Perhaps... They would be the perfect illustrator for a temp ally.<br />
Goths- This nation we get along with, now. We dont know what will happen if we turn the other way on them, but we hope it wont result in the Middle Ages.<br />
<br />
hmm.. thats everyone, I think.</div></div><hr />
