<br />
I am a little bemused as to why someone should spend any amount of time trying to build a HOF score on a custom map that had no &quot;enemies&quot; in the game.<br />
<br />
I am currently playing a Custom HOF game and am thoroughly enjoying having to compete with two other Civs with 60+cities and having major wars.<br />
<br />
My point is anyone with the knowledge can set up a custom game with and put Civs where they want and alter other aspects, but I cannot see the point.<br />
<br />
The map that I am playing on was created by a fellow Civkie and all I knew was that it was one continent.<br />
<br />
Although you cannot dictate(or can you) what makes a valid game for a HOF purpose, surely you must have some sort of guilt in submitting obviously constructed(cheat) games.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the only option lies in supplying worlds for people to play and relying on honesty in playing them.<br />

I mean, the #1 game is no fun; I'm sorry. One important aspect is e.g. the way you deal with opponents, (on which I happened to fail in the first Game of the Month). But also dealing with less a cosy landscape.<br />
<br />
I agree with you Jules! Maybe there should be some sort of separation: custom maps and random maps. They may choose the rest, but not the map.<br />

<br />
Cheats I say, CHEATS!!!!<br />
<br />
It is human nature!<br />
<br />
If a person can cheat, lie, steal or bend rules to suit themselves, more than half of the time they will!<br />
<br />
That's why we have police departments, spies, criminal records, jails, courthouses, speed camers, breathalizers, tax audits, private investigators, jails, parole, restraining orders...<br />
<br />
Ah gee I can go on forever!<br />
<br />
That's only for the ones that get caught! There are many smart immoral people in this world, and not many people can me trusted with any type of authority!<br />
<br />
I say regulate the games so that there can be no cheating, (or do your very best trying), because there is ONE in EVERY group!<br />

The weak who cannot face defeat and must get around it by painting their entire map with rivers and letting the Romans start on a 1 tile mountain island.<br />
<br />
There should be a standard, like World Maps only. Random maps are not necessary because they rely on whether you're lucky enough to start in good position or not.<br />
<br />
Wait! good idea: Have high score HOF like the GOTM, where you download a scenario in 4000BC. THat way, everyone starts equal. But that wouldn't be too fun.....</div></div><hr />
