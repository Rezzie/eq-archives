<br />
The following list is based on the 560 AD poll and the rather limited 560 AD discussion.<br />
The main result is that WLTP will be started now. The way things are looking we should probably celebrate for 4-7 turns, depending on when the celebrations run out of steam.<br />
The goal is to get Dou to size 12 and as many other cities as possible to size 8. We can hardly get them all to size 8 so Neu, LC, RF, LP, EF and FW have priority (in roughly this order).<br />
<br />
560 AD<br />
Set tax=60%, lux=40%<br />
Change production in Dou so it builds aqueduct next turn, then set Dou's production to maximum trade.<br />
Maximize trade in Neu and rush buy marketplace there.<br />
Rush buy harbor in Ipec, work ocean instead of grassland.<br />
Rush buy harbor in VM, work goldmine instead of forest.<br />
Remaining cities: Maximize trade but try to have at least one shield.<br />
<br />
580 AD and later<br />
LP and EF may need harbor soon.<br />
Increase luxuries if necessary to keep celebrating.<br />
Rush buy stuff as needed, harbors for enough food and marketplaces to keep cities celebrating by increasing trade. Possibly also temples.<br />
Possibly rush buy a courthouse in at least one eastern city if we can afford it but the cities near Dou have priority.<br />
Dou should start a University next (switch to harbor and rush buy it if necessary but I doubt this will happen).<br />
LC may need irrigation soon.<br />
In the unlikely event that we have the $$ to do so, rush buy aqueducts in cities like Neu, LC and RF if/when they reach size 8.<br />
Deliver Dou's caravans to foreign cities but don't deliver until Dou has reached size 12 (this shouldn't be a problem). IIRC we need to be generating at least some beakers when they are delivered to get a science bonus.</div></div><hr />
