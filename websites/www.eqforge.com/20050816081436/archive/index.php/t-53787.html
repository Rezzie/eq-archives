There's no queue, but I'm tired and need to sleep. I won't be staying up for this one.<br />

When we get writing in 1 turn, please lower science until we still get it in 1 turn. Currently, writing seems to cost all of our gpt. <br />
<br />
If we wait, it will be cheaper. We may even find another civ, which will lower the research time if they have it.</div></div><hr />

Summary: This was a very freeform chat as there were essentially no directives left for me. Writing was purchased from the Americans and our tech rate adjusted to 10% to start building our treasury (we need cash for legion upgrades). A settler was built and is moving towards the dyes east of the land bridge. Iron is connected but not usable yet. We either need to use a worker to create a colony or get Gorina's borders expanded. We've discovered the Greek homeland, far to the north of Egypt. We've met the Aztecs and figure their homeland to be well east of Egypt. We acquired The Wheel, Mysticism and 19g from Monty in exchange for Alphabet and contact with America and Greece. As Monty had already met Cleo the window on this deal was very short - he would have received them from her very quickly. This revealed an incredible bounty of horses. We have a source in our borders, 2 tiles from Noshuret. There is another at the far west end of our continent and another half way between Gorina and the south coast. A fourth source is 4 tiles from where Dye City is planned.<br />
<br />
I hope that future chats will have better direction from the game leaders.</div></div><hr />
