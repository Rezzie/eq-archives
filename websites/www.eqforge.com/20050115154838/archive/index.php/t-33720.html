On my brand new computer it is about 96 right now, after it has been on for a while it gets up to 106. NOTE: these temps are in farenheit.  I have 3 fans counting the power supply fan.  I am going to get 2 more case fans to try to help keep everything cooler.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Oct 09, 2002, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">82.....<br />

That's running 7, count 'em 7 fans. 3 pump air out the front, 1 cools right over the processor and the other 3 process the air. Their is also a heat sink with heat sink gel on the processor itself.<br />
<br />
I also turn down the Air conditioning really low :D  <br />
<br />
I am also experimenting with other various methods including performing a case mod and cutting a hole into my case in the middle and sticking in a fan to intake the error coming out of the ac vent right behind my comp....i know...i'm cheating! :D<br />
<br />
If I didn't live where it's still 95 in the middle of the day I could get even colder!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King of Camelot</div><div class="date">Oct 09, 2002, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WOW Gonzo!!!!!! 7 fans!!!!!! Thats a lot of fans.  Getting ready for a huge heatwave or are you a major overclocker? ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We'll just say I have my desk in a very inconvenient position JUST so i can have the A/C duct to intake air from. I'm doing what I believe to be an unprecedented case mod(at least one I've never seen). I am taking out most of the two sides of the case and using lots of superglue and small support bars I am going to mount as many fans as I can on each side to blow in the air and out the other side. I'm also going to bust out an extra drive bay to increase the air flow. My goal: 70 degrees without any underclocking or any ice cubes involved. I know the fans will help a lot but I'm also going to have to turn the ac in my house down to about 60 degrees for a few days to get it cold enough!<br />
<br />
 Eventually I will overclock this thing hoping to reach about 2.2 Ghz(It's a 1.7 Ghz Pent IV) with the overclock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">animepornstar</div><div class="date">Oct 10, 2002, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how about getting watercooling instead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smash</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">damit..how do I check the temp?<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">on PC? use MBM5 (motherboard monitor, a freeware) Or in the bios at startup&gt;menu CPU health<br />
<br />
For me: 32°C for a 1.2ghz, and 20° for the copper G4 chip. Plus the G4 has only a heatsink, no fan at all :eek: Amazing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smash</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank you sir.PC yes.<br />
<br />
No fan in G4s?..how the heck...my g3 has a fan.Damn noisy one at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No fan at all, I said :) Blue grey G4...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smash</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats kinda scary.<br />
<br />
Leave it to Apple and they'll fix everything<br />
<br />
:goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Oct 11, 2002, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah :p<br />
Whatever....<br />
<br />
Either your temp monitor is grossly off or apple spent wayyyyy too much time worrying about the G4's temp...<br />
<br />
Maybe if they worried a little more about their crap for beans software :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 12, 2002, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">awww.. no discuss with stubborn people.... naturally there'll be always a thing to say about this or this... just stick with crashos (i guess MS didn't spend lot of time to debug their OS) and that'll be fine gonzie :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Oct 13, 2002, 06:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At least we get a blue screen so we know ours is going down..You just lock up! <br />
<br />
I think I'll go play some v1.29f Civ 3 in a little bit....too bad you macsters don't have that :D :D :D :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 13, 2002, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">why need thousand patches when it works fine with v1.00 :rolleyes: some people are so used with non working version and tons of updates...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">penvzila</div><div class="date">Oct 17, 2002, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never seen mine above 100f.  I have 3 case fans, all very quiet, one GPU fan, and the big one: Volcano 7+ on my CPU.  In all, it is very cool and surprisingly quieter than my old emachines, who i have niknamed &quot;Jet Engine&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Oct 17, 2002, 09:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking of unconventional cooling methods, when this computer fan died, I put it on &quot;assisted living&quot; (it gets hot in my room during the summer, too). I had a huge window fan blow air into the back of it. That seemed to do the trick.</div></div><hr />
