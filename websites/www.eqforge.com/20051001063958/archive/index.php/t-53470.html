We need to start splitting these cities up into worker, settler, and warrior factories. <br />
<br />
I would much rather have Gorina and Noshuret complete their granaries so that they can be settler factories. <br />
<br />
Nar Shaddaa should be our worker factory (alternate with warriors).<br />
<br />
Penguin should build a mixure of workers and settlers.</div></div><hr />

Well, one of the granaries will be replaced with a temple if we can get ceremonial burial.  Noshuret is never going to be much of a settler factory, but it needs a granary to grow.  It should serve as a troop 'factory'.<br />
<br />
I can live without the granary in Gorina, as well.  It doesn't even really need one to be a settler factory.</div></div><hr />

Nosh can then build up military and Gorina some workers to irrigate the cows at nar and Peng and further improve tiles. Then use Gorina for Wonders and Pen and Nar for Settlers. and more morkers.</div></div><hr />

With a warrior and a luxury we don't need the smiley urgently, and Gorina is not a border city. In the 2nd ring I will be eager to see temples going up.<br />
<br />
Granary seems like a waste of time to me in Noshuret still... if we have the barracks there we want as many vets coming out of it as we can, and in exchange, the other cities that would normally be producing a couple warriors each can go directly to improvements.</div></div><hr />

Siegmund makes a good point by stating that Noshuret can produce the lion's share of our miltary early on.  This will free up the other cities to produce Granaries.  As I've said before in other threads, we can send Workers from these soon-to-be-thriving cities to join Noshuret and help it grow that way.<br />
<br />
At this time, I don't see the need to go after Temples.  We should use our newly acquired Granaries to produce Settlers so that we fill out the region with cities before our neighbors do.  This will keep our population low for awhile, but the benefits will be staggering.   Let's get up to 8-10 cities.  After that, we can enlighten those cities and put them to work at the same time.  ;)</div></div><hr />

It's times like these that I need to make a city growth program. :) (Like my flip calc)<br />
<br />
Anyway, with a granary, it will grow quicker, and thus have more shields quicker.</div></div><hr />
