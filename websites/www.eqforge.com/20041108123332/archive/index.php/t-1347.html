<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marko</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2001, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The scenario is big and many people can think that it is very complicated to orienteer in it. It is not so. All my playtesters managed to install and play the TSFE without any problems. <br />
The most important rule is:<br />
<br />
BEFORE LOADING A SAVED GAME OR STARTING SCENARIO RUN EUROPE.BAT!!!<br />
<br />
The program manages all scenario files and set everything up. You don't need to make any backup files or special folders!<br />
<br />
Here is excerpt from Readme.txt:<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------<br />
<br />
HOW TO INSTALL?<br />
<br />
Create a folder named &quot;Europe&quot; under your &quot;Scenario&quot; folder. Copy following files into the new folder: <br />
<br />
From 40July.sc1 to wterrain2.bmp (429 files – 18.4 MB).<br />
<br />
Create a folder named &quot;Sound&quot; under your &quot;Europe&quot; folder. Copy following *.wav files supplied with this scenario into the new &quot;Sound&quot; folder: <br />
<br />
From aircombt.wav to Torpedos.wav (42 files – 9.17 MB).<br />
<br />
The game needs Civilization II MGE with installed Update 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
HOW TO PLAY SCENARIOS?<br />
<br />
Very important: every time before you start new scenario or load saved game you must run Europe.bat (double-click on it)! <br />
<br />
This brings up a menu from which you should select difficulty level and then <br />
Start new scenario (option 1) or <br />
Load season files or reload your saved game (option 2). <br />
<br />
If you want for example start new scenario as Soviets from June 1941 then: <br />
<br />
1.	Double-click on Europe.bat<br />
2.	Choose difficulty level (options 1, 2, or 3)<br />
3.	Choose Start new scenario (option 1)<br />
4.	Choose June 1941 (option 3)<br />
5.	Choose Soviet Union (option 3)<br />
6.	Close Europe.bat program window<br />
7.	Open Civ II MGE<br />
8.	Choose Begin scenario<br />
9.	Load Europe.scn from your ...\Scenario\Europe folder<br />
10.	Choose Soviet Union<br />
11.	Choose Marshal (recommended)<br />
12.	Choose Male (or Female if  you wish)<br />
13.	If you want you can change your leader's name<br />
14.	Enjoy the scenario<br />
<br />
If you have for example saved your game as Axis at August 1943 and want to continue the game then:<br />
<br />
1.	Double-click on Europe.bat<br />
2.	Choose difficulty level (you can change that every time when you load a saved game)<br />
3.	Choose Load season files or reload your saved game (option 2)<br />
4.	Choose Summer 1943 (option 9)<br />
5.	Choose Axis (option 1)<br />
6.	Choose flags as you have in your game (remember which nations you had)<br />
7.	Close Europe.bat program window<br />
8.	Open Civ II MGE<br />
9.	Choose Load a game<br />
10.	Load your saved game from your ...\Scenario\Europe folder<br />
11.	Continue the game<br />
<br />
Every March and November an event text will pop up and prompt you to save the current position as EU.sav, run the Europe.bat program, change the season and reload your game. Changing the season work the same way as reloading your saved game (look above), only difference is that you must save the game as EU.sav before running Europe.bat. This is very important!<br />
<br />
It is also possible to change difficulty level during a game: <br />
<br />
1.	save game as EU.sav, <br />
2.	run Europe.bat, <br />
3.	change difficulty level, <br />
4.	chose &quot;load season files or reload your saved game&quot;<br />
5.	chose right time and nation <br />
6.	load the game. <br />

Seems that you lost some of its contents during downloading. Download it again.<br />
<br />
When you load your saved game better is to run Europe.bat and go through all its choices. <br />
The program restores rules, labels, sounds etc for your current game.<br />
But if you haven't changed them in between (like playnig other TSFE game) it is not neccessary.</div></div><hr />

For playing Medium level as Soviet Union in Summer 41 you must have Events14e.txt. Check it also. <br />
If everything is OK then the reason can be that in some rare cases Civ2 engine simply fail to launch some events. I have seen that but it is really rare and I don't believe that it is your case. <br />
<br />
SunTzu: Minor Nations attitude toward Axis is set to worshipful at the beginning of scenario. So they mustn't attack you for a while. Only way to prevent them attacking you at all is to put them to alliance with Axis. <br />
I don't like to do it because it takes out many possibilities. Some players like to invade to Turkey and use it as base for operations against Middle East and Caucasia. Axis must have choice to do it. <br />
But I shall change Minor Nations character to peaceful in next version of TSFE. This must hold them back. <br />
But until it try to use their attack for your advantage: except Istanbul and Switzerland all their cities are lightly defended and some have good production and strategic value.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I played on hardest level from th start as axis...I want to know if I am missing something: how do I end the brit attacks in Norway?<br />
I am trying the scenario again as I advanced so slowly at heavy cost...not being lazy this time, micro-managing it too the extreme.<br />
<br />
You said only one person could probably win as axis on hard level...does he give tips???<br />
Has anyone taken out the russians on hard?</div></div><hr />
