<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">philippe</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2002, 01:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone!<br />
i hope you all have fun time playing the GOTM?<br />
Well here comes a new challenge with the GOTM8 map<br />
and you will get a specific mission:<br />
examples:be the first one with future tech,have all the spice in the world,do not get involved in a war until a certain date...etc.<br />
Now i want YOU,the poeple to vote if its a good idea.<br />
and to not make matrix life harder i will organise it and check the <br />
savegames.<br />
But if matrix want do  this too he may also control the savegames.<br />
its something fun to do when your done with GOTM8.<br />
:D <br />
now everyone please vote YES!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2002, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like a coll idea, phillipe! :goodjob: However, I'm always a kind of conservative guy and I think that a lot of GOTM players would rather play a normal game instead of something like this, so it will never be a GOTM mission on itself. But it's always fun to do something like this next to the GOTM. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">philippe</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sure i had just the same thought</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaSilva</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2002, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But I finished mine already :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2002, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am replying to your post on cheiftess thread that is now closed, or I would have responded their.  I would be interested in making maps.  I am a rather good map maker, I think at least.  I don't know if I would have time to play all the games, with the GOM and tourney going, but I would like to make maps.  This could be made into a whole other thread on the main civ III page like the tourney is,  since it is not quite suitable for the GOM thread at least.  That is if their is enough interest in the idea.<br />
<br />
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PLAYING PLEASE MAKE A RESPONSE<br />
<br />
I don't know what exactly what the thread would be called, bt that's your dept.  A few things to discuss though:  Will thunderfall mind our thread,  is their enough people out their that want to play to make it worthwhile, how often would games come out monthly weekly bi-weekly whatever,  are their going to be any rules changed from game to game, what level are the majority of the games going to be on or will it just very extremely, THUNDERFALL RESPONSE PLEASE.<br />
Again I am interested in making maps, this sounds like loads of fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">philippe</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2002, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so i thought spice trader challenge exist in 2 parts:<br />
1)custom maps challenge mission(skaternate thank you for willing to help me)with new maps that skaternate makes and maybe also a little map from me;))<br />
2)GOTM mission:with the current GOTM map doing a mission.<br />
like:be the first to have tanks or something else....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Jun 05, 2002, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Their may be people out their willing risk sacraficing their GOM score a little for a challenge, but not I.  As for any tech challenges that would have to be on high levels, where it would be hard to spread.  I think this would be the easiest way to make any tech thing a challeng.  How exactly do you plan on ranking people?  Since say it's first to gather all the spices, will it purely be on speed or will you add in historograph score.  As for any ties they should be resolved by score I believe.  And then theirs still the question of how many people are interested in this?  How are we going to set this up eh!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">philippe</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2002, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its by date.<br />
and who the first one is in date wins.the others are determineted <br />
on their date.who has a equal date,its then the score.<br />
so its about being great AND being fast.<br />
and it will not always be tech<br />
i will think about other missions...<br />
and i hope a lot of players are interested.and you dont have to sacrifise your GOTM for the spice trader challenge<br />
you can play both games AND the custom map challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">God</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2002, 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, but I'm not too interested in the GOTM to have these challenges. I think we can leave the variants up to the SGs in their SG forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SKILORD</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2002, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taé Shala</div><div class="date">Jun 06, 2002, 11:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I don´t.<br />
<br />
For my opinion we have already enough goals.<br />
I fear that with to much goals the competition will divide to much.<br />
Thats silly. :sheep:</div></div><hr />
