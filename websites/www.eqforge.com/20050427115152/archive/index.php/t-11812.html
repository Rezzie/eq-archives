<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Dec 11, 2001, 01:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I've made some statistics. First of all rather simple: 89% won and 11% lost. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Secondly, here is the division of ways of ending:<br />
Conquest: 44%<br />
Domination: 24%<br />
Space Race: 8%<br />
Cultural: 3%<br />
Diplomatic: 4%<br />
Histographic: 17%<br />
<br />
And last, but not least: all the scores plotted as a function of the last turn. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Excilus</div><div class="date">Dec 11, 2001, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the dot-plot. Notice the near perfect correlation between turns and score. It follows a weibull distribution almost perfectly.<br />
<br />
We need a new scoring system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChrisShaffer</div><div class="date">Dec 11, 2001, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That perfect correlation only applies to conquest and domination victories.  The other victory types do not plot so cleanly.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit - note that I agree completely that we need a new scoring system, I was just pointing out that other factors (primarily amount of territory) determine score for non-conquest/non-domination victories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cutiestar</div><div class="date">Dec 12, 2001, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think for the person that achieved the space race victory and had more land or culture, it means they were able to achieve their victory with a more rounded game, so they deserve any higher score they get, i mean someone who just flags all culture buildings and population, just builds heaps of mines and uses high science targeting straight at building a space ship, really that is a pretty daft way to play a civ game in my opinion.<br />
<br />
As for the early victory bonus, this GOTM 1 really was favourable for that, especially to those that had previously seen the map ( not suggesting anything there);) <br />
<br />
If the same people tried the same tactic on GOTM 2 I think you'd find most of them with major failures, so we'll see.  But you can win one or do well in one GOTM and totally fail in another, so these stats will have no true meaning until after a few GOTM's are finished I think.</div></div><hr />
