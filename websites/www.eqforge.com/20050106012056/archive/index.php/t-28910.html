There are many variations of stuff like this.  The geneology of this particular one is what a group of us were doing at work (not FOR work, hehe!) in 1985 (yes, we had gov't jobs... but also some &quot;free&quot; time, LOL!), and the toilet is taken from an old zerox of a drawing someone did on this theme. We did a lot of other stuff, too, includinga hilarious psuedo-German language explanation of one of the Weapons systems we were developing (cruise missiles, e.g. &quot;der flippen-flappen-floppen&quot;).  PS, I was not an artist!  But now that I'm learning some digtial stuff, I spent about 3 hours at 8X magnification the other day using not some fancy software like Photoshop, but the humble screen capture program, HypersnapDX  (see the threads about Avatars in the Site Feedback for more).   BTW, the name &amp; program used are for reference for those what want to know how it is done (see threads I mentioned), and I don't mind if others copy/use/post/save/whatever  it...  like all the other variations on this theme, it is for amusement.</div></div><hr />
