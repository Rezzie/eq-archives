I did mark that I had won though since I can no longer lose by any means.  I have all the Iron, rubber, and all but one horse and am currently working on taking over the world.  No one can stop me.</div></div><hr />

The Shogun decided that my peaceful scout galleys needed to be taught a lesson.  My GA starts around 600 AD, and peace is reached near 800 AD, with me kicking Japan off the 3 nearest islands and establishing a beach-head on his.  I get a Great Leader while destroying a Japanese city on the Big Jungle island (of all places); declaring peace allows me to safely transport him to the Japan main island, to form an army of elite swordsmen.<br />
<br />
Round 2 : about 1090 AD (dictated by getting Chivalry.)  My Army and its retainers are joined by 10 Knights.  After a couple of turns destroying his offensive units that have foolishly taken the field (Horsemen and Longbowmen), my force is cutting through the Japanese heartland.  It wont be long.:egypt:  I've already gotten a second Great Leader, and will reform my palace in the center of the Japanese homeland.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creepster</div><div class="date">Jul 18, 2002, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I attacked japan aroung 720 AD.  It is going to be a long war with them.  They currently have a weak military, but it is taking me forever to beat them back with my knights.  I have decided not to raze the cities and between taking control of them and moving forward they are loosing only one city evrey two or three turns.  I can't get the military over there fast enough with the caravels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They outclass me in units but I desperately needed either a GL (to rush Bach's to get GA) or a win with WC (to get GA). First time playing this level and I'm getting whipped :cry::whipped:<br />
<br />
Managed to tempt a Longbowman out of a city with a bait unit, WC then killed him :mwaha:<br />
<br />
Immediately sued for peace - cost me 40 gold plus some dead galleys but well worth it for GA. :)<br />

Still playing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ribannah</div><div class="date">Jul 19, 2002, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Japan landed two warriors near my city on the little island between our two continents in 50 AD, then attacked without provocation the next turn - which cost them their supply of Furs, haha. Needless to say they ran dead on my hill-fortified spearman in town.<br />
I responded by upgrading my warriors to swordsmen and taking one of their smaller cities on their home continent.<br />
Now, they suddenly have a source of iron which doesn't show on the map! <br />
It must have popped up in a city square - ah, yes it did -  they sure hadn't swordsmen before. No matter, we ain't afraid. ;)<br />
<br />
Update: I took another Japanese city and destroyed a third, built three of my own on their continent, and made peace in 360 AD after my first army (3 swordsmen) made a kill. Might have another go at them after the Heroic Epic is completed. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kemal</div><div class="date">Jul 20, 2002, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Japanese declared war on me before 10 AD. They attacked my warrior who was trying to map Japanese territory. It wasn't a war really as neither side saw serious combat until about 1100 AD when they suddenly attacked and burned one of my cities on the small jungle island. :mad:<br />
<br />
Fortunately they had no saltpeter so my cavalries made quick work of conquering the Japanese main island.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scientia</div><div class="date">Jul 21, 2002, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">320 AD - Japan demands gems -- or else.  I refuse.  They declare war.  I didn't have a large offensive force yet, but I was confident I could defend my cities from any offensives they might launch.  Most of the fighting took place on the medium sized jungle island just to the NW of the Japanese main continent (not the one with dyes).  They only seemed to have archers and horsemen (they didn't appear to have an iron source, which was good for me).  <br />
<br />
They found the one city with one defender on that island (an elite spearman) and captured the city using a veteran horseman.  2 turns later I took the city back, then proceeded to raze the 3 cities they had established on the northern most part of the island.<br />
<br />
During this war the most frustrating thing was that the japanese galleys kept prevailing against my galleys ( I lost more units in transport than in ground engagements).  All in all, I lost about 8 galleys, most of them fully stocked with swordsmen.  I was just about to launch an invasion of the japanese mainland when they sued for peace (640 AD).  They gave some gold and the republic, and I had mixed feelings about taking it because I had already made contact with Persia, Aztecs, Germany and America (who had no contact with Japan) and I was aware that I was way behind in tech, and switching to republic seemed like a good strategy ( I was still in depotism).    On the other hand, I was hoping for a GL so that I could rush the Forbidden Palace on the island with dyes (I had about 4 cities started there).<br />
<br />
I ended up taking peace (think I should have held out for a GL), but am keeping my eye on Japan.  They still don't appear to have iron, and still don't have contact with other civs, so as long as I can keep that situation entact, they should be easy to remove later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jul 24, 2002, 11:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bumping these back up to the top to hope we get even more responses.<br />
<br />
Last months polls got about 38 replies and this months game is much bigger and slower so that may effect the response rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scientia</div><div class="date">Jul 25, 2002, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hind sight is 20/20 . . . .<br />
<br />
I should have stayed at WAR with Japan and not accepted peace so soon.  My error in judgement was thinking that I could come back later and finish them off.  I should have pressed forward while I had the advantage . . . <br />
<br />
It turned out that Japan managed to get 4 cities on the SE end of the island with dyes (I had the dyes covered fortunately), but one of the city spots that they grabbed happened to have iron.<br />
<br />
Of course that city was by itself and didn't have a harbor or road leading anywhere that would allow that iron to be available.  So I casually took my time, waiting a painstakingly long time for my Forbidden Palace to finish so I could see some positive production and commerce from the cities I had founded there.<br />
<br />
In 960 AD the Americans discovered Navigation and I knew I only had a matter of time before the rest of the world would know Japan, who I had kept out of conact with every other civilization.  I was painfully behind in tech and had pretty rampant corruption due to the number of cities I had and the fact that my FP still wasn't completed.  I was waiting for knights so I could boot the Japanese off &quot;my&quot; island &lt;g&gt; with absolute prejudice and certainty.<br />
<br />
Fate had other things in store for me.  I know sooner discover chivalry and *poof* my iron disappears.  Maybe I should have attacked then with what forces I had, but I waited still.<br />
<br />
By this time, all the civs have contact with each other (I sold contact with Japan to everyone the moment I saw a caravel off the coast of dye island).  I'm still lagging in tech, but I've had some success closing the gap by selling the 3 luxeries I own.  Eventually I was able to  produce Cavalry.  I'm still without iron (no one had any extra to trade, and the islands with other sources are alread settled).  I'm thinking once again of hitting Japan because they don't have saltpeter and the time is ripe.<br />
<br />
I move a large stack of forces near there city with iron and what do I see . . . infantry.:rolleyes: <br />
<br />
So to make a long story short, my FP doesn't finish until the mid 1700's.  Everyone else has railroad, but I'm still without iron, and Japan, who had no iron, and no saltpeter, now has multiple sources of each.  How's that for irony?<br />
<br />
By the time my cities on the dye island can produce anything, I am woefully behind.  Persia beat me to the UN, but thankfully, every other Civ has been locked in a world war since the mid 1500s.  <br />
<br />
My only chance now is for a spaceship victory, but that's going to be very difficult without factories.<br />
<br />
I've read other peoples accounts of majestic victories but I think its fair to say that if I'm somehow able to pull any victory off at this point, it will be pretty freakin amazing.<br />
<br />
I've never had a game where I've been so deadlocked for so long, so this is a learning experience for me.  Aztecs were destroyed by the Persians in mid 1800s (??)  America has reduced Germany to 3 cities, and Persian and Japan have a MPP and are duking it out with America.  <br />
<br />
Japan probably has the largest military force . . . lol.  Since I probably have no shot at winning, I've thought about signing an MPP with Persia and then provoking Japan just to split up that alliance. ;) <br />
<br />
I should finish this GOTM tomorrow or Saturday.</div></div><hr />
