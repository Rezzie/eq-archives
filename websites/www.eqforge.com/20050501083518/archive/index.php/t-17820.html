Seems that happened what I have feared: I lost #10 place in the global ranking :( (being #11 equal to stephen).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trash</div><div class="date">Mar 05, 2002, 04:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yay, I got third :jump:<br />
<br />
Congrats to EMan, very early finish, well deserves first. When i finished i hadn't even attempted to fight the indians, and the persians were still there, but beat up REAL bad i coulda wiped them out with my modern armour in a couple of turns.<br />
<br />
Funny thing in my cultural victory was i had the lowest culture in the game. I just luckily happened to build early temple &amp; library &amp; lots of wonders in London so it reached the 20,000 limit at 93 culture per turn at the end</div></div><hr />

<br />
There sure are a lot of good scores in the results for such a challenging map!<br />
<br />
I'm really happy, got a new medal, a nice blue globe! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Mar 05, 2002, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Matrix: 2719<br />
Nitro: 2709<br />
<br />
Nitro is my brother. :D :p<br />
He's always better than me. :(<br />
<br />
Anyway, last month Dirty Clint stood #1 in the Global Ranking because he played all three games and the others only two. But now that Aeson and SirPleb also have played three games he's still #1. So now it's well deserved! :goodjob:<br />
<br />
And EMan, you were indeed fast! :eek: I check your history (as always ;)) and you really knew how to squeeze the pop-rushing up to it's limit. No wonder you ended your submission with &quot;Farewell pop-rushing&quot;. ;)<br />
<br />
Congratulations to Lucky and Trash too. ;)<br />
<br />
By the way, as I followed the results after I finished my game, #4, 5 &amp; 6 were then #1, 2 &amp; 3. That's would've been a close finish (6015, 5982, 5970)! Unfortunately this wasn't the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Matrix, thanks for the praise man but i'm not sure if I deserve to be number 1. I'm not 100% sure on how you do your calculations but according to the global ranking page the ranking is based on an average of the three best games in the last 5 months.<br />
<br />
 My best 3 scores are 6132, 15445, 5866, which total 27443<br />
Divided by 3 this is 9147.67.<br />
<br />
 SirPleb's 3 scores are 6015, 13692, 7883 which totals 27590<br />
divided by 3 this is 9196.67.<br />
<br />
 Like I say I don't know how you do your score calculations on the global ranking page but based on a simple averaging system SirPleb should be number 1.<br />
<br />
I'm happy to remain there, ;)  but unless my math is wrong ( and hey it's not my best skill) SirPleb deserves the position.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 05, 2002, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GOTM Global Rankings Formula (courtesy of Taé Shala in an earlier thread)<br />
<br />
(PlayerScore / AverageScore) * 25 = GameRanking<br />
<br />
Best 3 of 5 GameRankings / 3 = GlobalRanking<br />
<br />
GOTM 4 average: 3332<br />
GOTM 3 average: 3039<br />
GOTM 2 average: 3596<br />
GOTM 1 average: 2405<br />
<br />
DirtyClint's ranking:<br />
<br />
6132/2405 * 25 = 63.7<br />
<br />
15445/3596 * 25 = 107.4 (you should be on top till GOTM 8 at least because of this score :lol: )<br />
<br />
5866/3039 * 25 = 48.3<br />
<br />
(63.7 + 107.4 + 48.3) / 3 = 73.1<br />
<br />
<br />
SirPleb's ranking:<br />
<br />
6015/3332 * 25 = 45.1<br />
<br />
13692/3596 * 25 = 95.2<br />
<br />
7883/3039 * 25 = 68.8 <br />
<br />
(45.1 + 95.2 + 68.8) / 3 = 69.7<br />
<br />
I guess I've been doing rounding a bit differently than Matrix does (off by about 2 for each ranking), but you get the point ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I must go back to the War Academy again.;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirty Clint</div><div class="date">Mar 05, 2002, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aha, thanks for clearing that up for me Aeson, I remember Tae Shala's post now. I understand the formula, it just seems a little awkward to me compared to the way I worked it out but as I stated earlier maths is not my strong point. Looks like we need some more domination disabled games in the future to allow people to catch up in points.;) <br />
<br />
 Ah well I will humbly accept the number 1 position for now:goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChumChum</div><div class="date">Mar 06, 2002, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">special congrats to eman.<br />
i tried to do what he did but his was so convincingly better that i am humbled.<br />
<br />
also my consolodations to IronKight, i see he didn't quite win his epic struggle.<br />
<br />
maybe next time gadget...<br />
<br />
-ChumChum<br />
:cooool:<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. two questions regarding global score.<br />
1. if you have only played two games is the total divided by 2 instead?<br />
2. how come my two scores of 44 and 30 average out to 10?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Mar 06, 2002, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">YEAH! :yeah:<br />
Silver medal, now I only need a golden one! ;)<br />
Congratulations to everybody else.<br />
<br />
I knew my game was pretty good, it was the longest time I spent on playing a Civ3 GOTM. Seems my hard work was worth it. :cool:<br />
<br />
As mentioned in the Spoiler thread I played my game fully with the 1.17f patch, so no pop-rushing for me! It looks like pop-rushing only makes the difference for early conquest games, I like that.<br />
<br />
EMan was awesome fast, 590AD is great. :goodjob:<br />
By that time my great offensive against the Zulu only just began. My expansion wars lasted up to the 16th, 17th century and I didn´t have much peacetime in between. Pop-rushing indeed makes a great difference!<br />
EDIT: Oh, and what also makes a difference is probably the not always retreating faster units, my horsemen were almost useless against enemy cities, only good for picking off damaged units in the open!<br />
<br />
Well let´s see how early conquest can be achieved in GOTM4 on another small map without PR.<br />
<br />
Anyway I had the most fun in this GOTM of all Civ3 games I played so far.<br />
But it´s not likely that I can repeat this tedious effort in the endgame in the near future, I could only do this because of my term break! And I played all 3 GOTMs this month, won the Civ1 GOTM, second here and waiting for the Civ2 results. And all games played till the end!<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EMan</div><div class="date">Mar 06, 2002, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the compliments everybody AND congratulations to the other Medal &amp; Award winners AND all the other Players of GOTM4.<br />
<br />
Somebody asked me for a few details of MY GOTM4 game, so I thought why not share them with ALL the people that have helped me so much on this Site.<br />
<br />
The strategy I adopted was to build horsemen, horsemen, horsemen (using the &quot;pop-rush&quot; method) from the get-go and use &quot;fleets&quot; of galleys to move them from their &quot;birth continent&quot; to the battle zone. Basically, I captured the other civilizations going clockwise around the world. In fact, by 550AD I had all the civilizations conquered except the Aztecs, who were  &quot;resurrecting&quot; and had a few Galleys. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I sunk one of their Galleys and the AI said I had defeated the Aztecs BUT then the game crashed!! So, I had to wait until the Galley unloaded the Settler + Jaguar Warrior before the Final Conquest.<br />
<br />
So, I thought that Firaxis might like to see this Bug. Any of you GOTM Fanatics out there have a suggestion or email address to send  in this &quot;Program Crash&quot; position? <br />
<br />
Of course, for the newcomers out there, GOTM5 using Civ III Version 1.17f, as I will be this month, won't allow this Pop-Rush strategy.     ;)<br />
<br />
Finally, thanks to Matrix, Thunderfall and all the other Fanatics that make this site a truly Wonderful Worldly Great One.<br />
<br />

<br />
Indeed, like I said in the GOTM spoiler tread, I've finished last !!! yahoooo !!!!<br />
<br />
Hope to do better in the next one ... :cry: :cry: :cry:</div></div><hr />

It's only 6 days into the month, and I don't think I'm going to last another 20 turns!:eek: :mad: :eek: :mad:</div></div><hr />

I submitted my game on march 2nd but the results haven't been posted.  I also sent you an email about a week later with the attached game via the results page link.  Since I've had no word from you I don't know if the message or the two submitions have gotten through.  I'm nearly finished with this months game and would like to know if my previous submittions got through before I send in this one.  <br />
<br />
BTW I like the Civ Fanatic GOTM setup, youv'e done a good job.  I've played a few of Apolyton's games(and will continue to do so) but that site's games lack the ranking system.  I'm anxious to get into the ranks.<br />
<br />
Attached is the second to last turn as well as the 10AD save.  Please let me know if I've done it properly. <br />
