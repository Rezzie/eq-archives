http://www.civfanatics.com/civ3gotm/civ3gotm_results_02.shtml<br />
<br />
Here's Matrix's news posts<br />
----------<br />
Here are the results of second Game of the Month. This time SirPleb has won it, followed by Aeson (who ended second again) and Grey Fox. Aeson does lead in the Global Ranking now. Congratulations!<br />
<br />
Also, an award for the highest histographic victory has been added, though no one has retired in 2050 AD this time, so it only applies for the previous GOTM. May I also please remind everyone that you may not retire on any occation. You must end the game, so retirement is only valid at 2050 AD.<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
The submitted saved games should be available in a day or two...<br />
<br />
Good job Matrix.  :goodjob:</div></div><hr />

It is a nice feeling to see that I´ve done the fastest space launch. Even when my score isn´t as good as I thought compared with others.<br />

I was just assuming that my 300 point edge in the GOTM1 over Clint would be overcome by his 2600 point edge in GOTM2.<br />
<br />
I just looked at your replay Clint, those dirty Germans ;)  I'm glad the English weren't so uppity.  Were most of those city losses near the end due to cultural reversions?  Or did they actually mount an offensive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirty Clint</div><div class="date">Jan 08, 2002, 02:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">can't remember without looking at the replay again but at least 2 cities were reversions and after that they launched an attack - I had dismantled my army to save money because of SERIOUS financial shortfall so had to rebuild a few units. Cant understand reversion when you rule the world and they have only one city, lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
How global ranking works is easy to tell. :)<br />
<br />
Every month an average score is worth 25 points.<br />
<br />
If you have more you will get more points. <br />
In your case this month you had a score of 12951; the average score was 3596. So you have 12951 divided by 3596 = 3.60 ...  25 multplied with 3.6 is 90.0. Your points for global ranking.<br />
<br />
Then you take the best three results of the last five month and divide it by three.<br />
<br />
Until now we have only played two GotMs so we take the best two games and divide it by two.(67.1 for GotM1 and 90.0 for GotM2)<br />
(67.1+90.0)/2= 78.55. Round up and you will get 78.6.<br />
Your score for global ranking. :king:<br />
<br />
Easy, isn´t it?:goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Jan 08, 2002, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couldn't have done better myself, Taé! ;)<br />

By the way, Clint, I'm not at home now. That's why I don't know if I got your submission.</div></div><hr />

If my math is correct that would indeed mean Clint is the global rankings leader now.</div></div><hr />

 :D <br />
<br />
Dirty Clint:<br />
I was wondering whether you still have some other saves of your great game. It would be wonderful for me and others to see more of it and to learn!:enlighten<br />
Some saves of your conquest of the main continent would be especially interesting, judging from the replay I´d really like to see how you did that and how many units you needed.:soldier: I like well planned offensive wars myself very much and this seems to be a masterpiece!:goodjob:<br />
So please post any saves you have, a lot of players could profit from viewing them, which is exactly in the spirit of the GOTM.:yeah:<br />
<br />
You are the king :king: ! (this time :lol: )<br />
<br />
Same goes for other top scorers!<br />
Saves, strategies, maybe a timeline and other hints and tips from top scorers are always greatly appreciated by GOTM participants and everybody else in this forum!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Jan 08, 2002, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't have any of the save games left, though I had posted a 500AD one on another thread (the romans keep kicking my a** IIRC) for someone who was interested.  The main difference between my game and Clint's was the timing of the final conquest, and I razed everything while he captured cities.  My Calvary invasion of the mainland was a little before his, but stalled after taking the Indian and Northern German territory.  This was partly due to indecision on my part.  The other factor, which in Clint's replay didn't seem to be a problem (probably due to not razing cities, and the ROP tactics I didn't use enough), was that when I declared war on any AI civ, all the others would as well, taking many cities for themselves.  My Calvary defeated the armies of the Germans, Japanese, and Chinese quite easily.  Most of the cities were claimed by the French, Russians, and English though.  I was razing the cities I took, and then sent in a large number of settlers (~30) to claim land and resources.  After a scuffle with the English on this point (if you see the replay, you'll laugh), I just decided to hold back for overwhelming tech superiority (mech infantry, modern armor) to continue.  I'll know better next time ;)<br />
<br />
An interesting thing, I didn't build a single Knight (which I used almost exclusively to take out the Aztecs), or a single Calvary (used to take out the Indians, Germans, Japanese, and Chinese).  All my Knights and later Calvary were upgraded from the original Horsemen built for the conquest of the Romans.  I had built roughly 60 Horsemen, and ended up with about 30 Calvary (even after the scuffle with the English).  Such is the power of 2+ movement units against the AI, that 50% of my army would remain after several hundred battles.  Even during the French, English, and Russian invasions (against riflemen/infantry/tanks), the Calvary I had left almost all survived (they didn't win many battles though, just retreated from infantry and picked off a few wounded tanks for the most part).  The only thing they couldn't survive was the cost cutting measures employed shortly thereafter!<br />
<br />
On the subject of how I used my Calvary on the final war...  When I captured (well, razed) AI cities, they would usually have an artillery or two.  I would set these artillery out in the open, (moved them to non-railroaded sites) luring the AI to attack them instead of my Mech Infantry/Modern Armor.  This left a lot of AI Calvary and Tanks out in the open for my next turn.  For the most part I used my Mech Infantry to take out the Tanks and Calvary, but in some cases used my Calvary, the Modern Armor were only for attacking cities.  The main purpose the Calvary had though, was retaking Artillery each turn.  I don't know if this tactic made much difference, as my stacks of units at that point were quite invincible (as many as 30 Modern Armor and 5-10 Mech Infantry per stack).  There are times when the AI's thirst for workers/bombardment units can be used against it to great effect though.</div></div><hr />

I enjoyed being at the top of the list for a moment as I read this thread, but not at your expense, you belong there!<br />
<br />
I posted a short description of my game in the GOTM #2 spoiler thread with the name &quot;pieterb&quot; on December 30. I'm now and henceforth SirPleb.<br />
<br />
Thunderfall and Matrix: thank you!! GOTM is the most fun I've had with any game in a long time. It is great to see how people play from the same starting point and to read their stories.<br />
<br />
Lucky: I'm just finishing my shot at GOTM #3 and this time I kept a bit of a diary as I played. If I place well when the results are in I'll post my diary. Once I'm done my GOTM #3 (am so close that I can't resist finishing that first!) I will go see what I can resurrect from my GOTM #2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grey Fox</div><div class="date">Jan 08, 2002, 01:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even if I will lose my bronze medal, am glad for your 15000+ points... damn that's a High Score. <br />
<br />
Well I must be glad about my high Cultural victory score, and that I managed to Win at 2050. Must be one of the hardest things to do (I'm braging) to get a cultural victory on the Year 2050...<br />
<br />
Kinda good the for first time on a Monarch map...<br />
<br />
I thought I was going to get a Historical victory, but It kinda suprised me...<br />
<br />
One thing that helped must have been that I sold almost all my Librarys, my research Centers and universitys, couse I had 100% on Happiness the last 75-100 years... the future tech gave me no points so...<br />
<br />
Later I sold all my temples and some coloseums that wasn't needed. (Well I got som content and unhppy faces but that was late in the game so I didn't think i would affect my score that much).<br />
<br />
Congratulations once again to all you great players out there.<br />
<br />
And EekTheDog, you would have got a higher score if you played until 2050.</div></div><hr />

 Lucky, sorry buddy but I don't have any saves from earlier in the game I just use one save for the whole game which forces me to keep alert and removes any temptation to replay from a stronger position. I can give you some tips though. <br />
 Before I sit down and play a game I write some notes on what I think will achieve the highest possible score and what to do to achieve it (my personal games I play for enjoyment which does not usually involve a high score but for this I play for points).<br />
In this case it was obvious that with domination disabled (not again please) the highest score would be a 2050 victory,with only one opponents city remaining, and the quicker the conquest to that one city remaining point the better (due to the heavy bias in the scoring system of land area)<br />
<br />
Quick Points:<br />
<br />
1 Until conquest is achieved Despotism is the only government required, period.<br />
2 Expand as quickly as possible until you run out of room and then Pop rush Horseman with every city.<br />
3 Only 3 military units required - Horseman, Knights, and Cavaly (all overpowered due to faster movement and the ability to withdraw from combat), horseman are far better than sworsman.<br />
4 construct a series of roads to the enemy.<br />
5  Speed is of the essence if you want to keep the captured cities. I never attack an enemy until I have an overwhelming force which can destroy the entire civ. Cities won't culturally revert when the civ is dead, lol<br />
6 In the eary coquests when you can't destroy a civ in 2 -5 turns take out their horses and iron first.<br />
 those quick conquests that you see later on, ie English and on, I I had 200+ Cavalry. With these conquests the civs had railroad everywhere so I got right of passage agreements and parked 10 - 15 cavaly outside as many cities as possible and then attacked in one turn. Using this method the civ will fall in short order and there is no city reversion. I installed the patch in about 1400 AD and with the patch its hard to get an ROP after attacking another civ with an ROP in place but in future games you can at least use it to take out the biggest civ quickly.<br />
 I'm running out of time but if you want great tips read Aeson's posts - they are great. Also head over to Apolyton and go to their strategy forum and read the threads started by Velociryx - they are the best by far and will improve your game out of site.<br />
 Congratulations to the runner ups:) :) Great games guys!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirty Clint</div><div class="date">Jan 08, 2002, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with you Mogon that playing till 2050 is boring, at least with Domination disabled, but it is  the  boring parts of the game that require patience and long hours that will bring out the highest scores, not just in a 2050 win but even in an early conquest. There are so many little things that you can do in the game that will score xtra points here and there but they are boring for most people and do require patience. Micromanagement is one of them - I never automate anything even when my workers have irrigated and mined the whole of my territory I still won't put them on autopilot(Gotm2 being an exception towards the end as  cramp was setting in). On auto workers will only work a square in pairs and to me this is bad especially when you are playing a non - industrious civ. When you are cleaning up pollution for example the quicker you can clean it up and get production out of the square again the better so the more workers the better. Something else I do which requires lots of patience is every turn before I start a new turn I go into the F1 screen and check every city for Disorder and adjust that city if so. Yes this is boring but almost never do I have a city in disorder and over the course of a game this is worth a lot of points.<br />
 So yes alot of this game requires patience and is at times boring, but if you get players of equal skill together and play a game the person who spends the most time doing these little things right will usually win, apart from the luck factor of course.;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm with you there, except when conquest turns into mindless boredom as well, as it did/would in gotm2. UN is there to end the pain for people like myself. Since I'm not allowed to retire. And why? Many great leaders stepped down after they saw their time was at an end. After the 1500s if I don't own the world I step down and let a more patient leader carry-on. ;)<br />
