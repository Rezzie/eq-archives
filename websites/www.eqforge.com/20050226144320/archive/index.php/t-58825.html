Comments:<br />
<br />
Science has been shut down (it is 0%) as had been decided, everything in the science plan has been discovered. Despite this we are making discoveries every 17 turns because of the Einsteins. This is not a problem at the moment, we are researching Atomic Theory and it is Industrialization we want to avoid until we have built our infrastructure.<br />
<br />
We have considerable cash ($1548) despite some rush buys in 1670 AD (and lots of them in 1660 AD).<br />
<br />
Despite emphasis on military stuff as was voted for in the Coresux build queue polls building the infrastructure called for in MODALTSIR has started but at a relatively modest pace. It will soon get much faster because military buildup for invading Africa is finished and military buildup for invading Hell is almost complete should we decide to do so.<br />
<br />
As mentined military buildup for invading Africa is complete but just in case we might want to build an extra veteran cavalry in Suggestions and send it to Zimbabwe - the military advisor has a lot of goodies to play with in Suggestions ;).<br />
<br />
Military buildup for invading Hell (should we decide to do so) is almost complete. Naervana is our base of operations in this case. I'd add one more unit of alpine troops, a diplomat and maybe a cavalry or two if we go for it. Exploration has revealed that we could use fortresses to completely block Greek access to Knossos, Corinth, Athens and Argos.<br />
<br />
The Dou hides caravan near Naervana can be sent to Thermopylae (!) which demands hides.<br />
<br />
No AI civ has discovered or is researching gunpowder but it is only a matter of time before this happens - some of them are researching invention (a prereq for GP). The same is true of metallurgy (which would enable the AI civs to build coastal fortresses to defend against our mighty destroyers).<br />
<br />
Some questions:<br />
<br />
How should we invade Africa ? Do we need one more cavalry for Zimbabwe ?<br />
<br />
The million dollar question: Shall we start military operations in Hell ? If yes then probably at the same time as in Africa to effectively utilize the turns when we are not a democracy - this would mean maybe a 2-4 turn delay for the start of Africa operations.<br />
<br />
Should we start railroading Coresux or should supermarkets have complete precedence ? I built a few railroads.<br />
<br />
Igloria is very near the Greek city of Ephesos so I changed plans there and built a destroyer to guard against possible invasions from the sea. It could also be used for attacking cities like Knossos.<br />
<br />
Should we try to celebrate soon or concentrate on building more infrastructure for some time ?<br />
<br />
Is there general agreement about keeping taxes at 80% and science at 0% and concentrate on city infrastructure (libraries, banks, stock exchanges, courthouses, universities, supermarkets etc.), caravans and cash for a considerable time as called for in MODALTSIR ?<br />
<br />
Should we RB a ship in Berlin in the hope of catching a barbarian leader (probably not very likely) or continue building engineers there to colonize Barbaria ?<br />
<br />
Berlin is of size 1 and may be somewhat vulnerable. Anything special we should do in that area ?<br />
<br />
Two wonders have become available, Darwin and Eiffel Tower. We are in no hurry to build Darwin but the Indians are building Eiffel. Should we build it ? I do not recommend it except possibly for fun because it is just about the most worthless wonder in the game and we must finish with a spotless reputation anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we're leaving demo, I'm all for taking care of both of them at the same time if we can. This would probably delay growth, and make RR a higher priority at the moment. RRs should mostly be used for transportation in the beginning and not to increase production. <br />
<br />
We should colonize Barbaria as soon as we can, but we should probably build up Berlin a bit first (get it to size 3, maybe a temple or MP and a good defensive unit).<br />
<br />
Many of the elvii in Dou are useless, they should be set to research something or collect money instead.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Two wonders have become available, Darwin and Eiffel Tower. We are in no hurry to build Darwin but the Indians are building Eiffel. Should we build it ? I do not recommend it except possibly for fun because it is just about the most worthless wonder in the game and we must finish with a spotless reputation anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
I now notice that we will soon be in a hurry to build Darwin since the Indians are researching Railroad and given their science rate (a discovery every 4-6 turns) they should have RR 2-3 turns from now and DW 5-7 turns from now (they have lots of $$ and only a few turns passed from the time they started SOL until it was almost finished). IMO we should prevent the Indians from getting DW (and thus more techs) by building it. This is safe to do, when we build it we will discover Atomic Theory and be able to choose Fundamentalism over Industrialization. We will immediately discover it and end up researching but not discovering Industrialization.<br />
<br />
The above also means that the Indians may start researching gunpowder 2-3 turns from now and may have it 6-8 turns from now. By then we should be (mostly) finished with the Zulus and have taken a few Greek cities.</div></div><hr />

I now know I'll play tomorrow.</div></div><hr />
