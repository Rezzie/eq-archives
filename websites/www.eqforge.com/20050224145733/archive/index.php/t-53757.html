<br />
Banking<br />
Medicine<br />
Pottery<br />
Warrior Code<br />
The Wheel<br />
<br />
Please vote for two or three, and we'll create a ranked list as before.  If you think we should be looking a little more long-term, let us know why and what.<br />
<br />
Please make at least one choice something available next round, just to be safe :)</div></div><hr />

This was a somewhat difficult choice since BB, Seafaring and Banking would be very useful too (probably esp. banking and BB). However, I had in mind that the Aztecs are researching Seafaring so we should get it from them. Sooner or later we should probably try to get IW unless an AI civ starts researching BB.<br />
<br />
Leo and Bach are longer term goals with Bach the more interesting wonder if I had to choose since we seem to be following a stratgey that has more in common with perfectionism than militaristic strategies (and actually Bach is highly useful for a militaristic democracy).</div></div><hr />

Um.  We've had Pottery for some time now (needed to build Hanging Gardens). I thought we had, but somehow missed it when going back through the turn threads to determine what we gained and in what order.  I will correct my records.</div></div><hr />
