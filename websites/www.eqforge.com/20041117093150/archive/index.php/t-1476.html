<br />
I have browsed the web for some time now, but hasn't been able to find one. I know there's a perfect sound that fits the purpose in the film &quot;The English Patient&quot;, but I don't have the equipment to record it. So, if by any chance... I'd be very grateful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you by chance have a wonderful sound effect of this type on your hard drives? -I am beginning to get a little desperate! -It's just when I have fixed my mind on this, I can't get it out of my head! -It should be possible, as there must be hundreds of games with religious fanatics or charging arabs. <br />
-But I ended up with something less than useful. And I can't seem to find any of the combat sfx from AoE in the folders.</div></div><hr />

Modpack studio can't  allow you to browse them easily, but i think you can rip them all using Dragon UnPacker. It worked with chinese sounds i ripped from Fate of the Dragon DLLs. &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />

Where can I download that thing you talked about, P? Surely I could use it to take some sounds from AoK as well. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
