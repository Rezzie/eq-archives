Jason: I, Jason the fleet, once again call on all who will listen. I am in need of work. I am a skilled warrior and am the fastest in all the area. I would make a fine guard but am especially skilled at messemger and scout work. <br />
<br />
My price is only the chance the prove myself and of course food. I am so sure of my skills that I also offer up this challenge. I will race any man who comes and if someone prooves to be faster than myself, which certainly none will, than I shall follow them and them alone without listening to any other offers. So any takers?</div></div><hr />
