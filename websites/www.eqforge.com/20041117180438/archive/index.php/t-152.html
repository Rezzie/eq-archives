After the discovery made by Andu Indorin about the elements that affect the power graph on February 16th, Andu did some precise follow-up experiments and discovered more &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civfanatics.com/civ2powergraph.shtml&quot;&gt;fascinating results&lt;/a&gt;!! This time the discovery is accompanied by illustrations, tables, and numbers. I have converted his article into HTML and added it to the War Academy as a new course. You really don't want to miss this discovery... <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civfanatics.com/civ2strategy1.shtml&quot;&gt;Enter the War Academy!&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
Please post your comments about the discovery below.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many player put little credence on the powergraph.There are legitimate reasons proven here.<br />
<br />
A 4-size 8 city civ with 60 knights would look pretty meager on the powergraph compared to a 30-size 12 city civ with 30 warriors.<br />

yeah, I always thought the power graph takes # of military units into account. It contains the word &quot;POWER&quot;...</div></div><hr />

The leader in the PG is fourth in amount of cities, fifth in amount of units but first in overall population due to a well planned amount of republican we love days. I found this curious for the longest time, but this study helps explain everything for me. Thanks Andu!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kev</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2001, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Given that the power graph measures only population, tech and money, this says a great deal about people handing in bogus games for the hall of fame.  A power graph that reaches the top in a single measurement pretty much has to be cheating does it not?  There's no way to explain it via having a bunch of units.<br />

I've also noticed that population is a great factor in the powergraph. Sometimes, say in the beginning when I only have 10 cities, I purchase 8 settlers, it means I &quot;lose&quot; population equivalent to 8 settlers, my powergraph spikes down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually like how the powergraph measures population and ignores units. This way, it shows potentiol power. A real life would be the U.S. pre WWI and pre WWII, an economic superpower with a small military. Yet this economic and population giant with no army in 1941 can build an army capable of defeating Germany and Japan in four years. (Yes, there was allied help. And the pre-war drafts and preperations were important, but did not overall expand the military to the point where it could fight.)<br />
<br />
I know for my own personal Civ's I concentrate on money, tech, and production, and then quickly produce a large army should I need it for war.</div></div><hr />

I like PinkyGen's explanation of potential power, so I think it should remain this way.<br />
<br />
Other question: when those in-game powerratings (happiest civs, most powerful civs) are shown. Do they use the same method of calculating the most powerful civilization?<br />

<br />
Speaking of which, it'd be really nice if the City Status window (F1) gave a total cumulative food/shield/trade production rates at the bottom so you can get the big picture of your civilization quick and easy; they already do it for the trade advisor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the Foreign Advisor (F3) is actually based on military power; I seem to recall in many of my earlier games, while I had the largest, richest, and most advanced civilization in the world, my Foreign Advisor constantly reminded my that my power was not &quot;Supreme.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vladmir_illych_lenin</div><div class="date">Mar 28, 2001, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, Andu is right. If you have the most units (settlers, diplomats caravans don't count), your &quot;supreme&quot;. your might if second, etc.<br />
<br />
Basically, population is the root of power in Civ. The more people you have, the more tiles you work on, the more trade production and food, which leads to more population. Even if you have the most concentrated and centralized civ, and the AI has a few scattered cities but larger population, they will still have an edge over you. Firaxis should somehow change that. India has over 4 times as many people as the states, but most of them are living in the streets or are factory workers. I think for every person in a city over 3 should generate 1 &quot;poverty&quot; or something.</div></div><hr />

When you press F3 and it says Sire, our power is _____ is it related to Power Graph?<br />
<br />
<br />
My personal testing in Civ II MGE (5.4.0f, patch 3, 26 March 99) shows the two are related, and that neither ever count military units, unit value, military strength, etc.  My own informal tests back up Andu's results that Gold, Advances, and Population determine the plot of the Power Graph.<br />

<br />
<br />
For what its &quot;worth&quot;, I agree with your observation, Duke.  At least I've never been able to show that adding units influences the PR or PG at all.  http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif</div></div><hr />
