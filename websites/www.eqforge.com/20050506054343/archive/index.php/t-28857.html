CAN YOU BELIEVE IT, I HAVE BEEN RAGING WAR FOR CENTURIES AND STILL ONLY ONE LEADER!!!!!<br />
 <br />
I mean just one and I have conquered almost 2/3 of the pangea!! I used this one to create a army in the hope that heroic epic would generate new leaders but to no avail.<br />
<br />
Looking over the forum I saw a few entries of other civ III gamers suggesting that the way leaders are granted has become far more difficult in this patch.<br />
<br />
Like to hear if you have the same experience.<br />

You could take a look at the Strategy forum to see/ask how to get the best chance of getting a leader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smoking mirror</div><div class="date">Aug 04, 2002, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps it is harder to get leaders now, and I may have an idea why; I made a cavalry army with my first leader (1500s) and I'm not sure, because there was some confusion the only time I used it so far- I couldn't tell which units were which- because it seemed that my new army had the blitz ability! despite being a cavalry army (cavalry only have 1 attack per turn). I say there was some confusion cos attacking the second time was an accident- I meant to retreat, and I'm still not sure if it was the Army, or just a regular cavalry which attacked (sometimes when you click on a stack it is difficult to tell whether you are selecting a unit onits own or a unit which is in an army).<br />
Any way, I had to declare peace the next turn, and finding out if my hunch is true is not a good enough reason to go to war again.<br />
<br />
Has any one else seen this? it would be a good fix for armies, making them raly usefull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Smoking Mirror - I suspect you are correct that leaders are harder to come by now.  In the third tournament game this season, we are playing as the Germans with a goal of Domination.  i.e. lots of battles with a Militaristic trait.  In the entire game I only got 3 leaders, the first of which made a knight army, and then built Heroic Epic.  I think I only received 1 leader after the Heroic Epic, which went for Sun Tsu's.  In a game like this one, I used get 5 to 8 leaders.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MPF</div><div class="date">Aug 05, 2002, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe its just bad luck but I have been monitoring the GOTM IX thread and a surprisingly high number of players are complaining about the lack of leaders. I used mine leader right away to build an army so I could create the heroic epic. <br />
<br />
But that wasn't till 1788!!!! <br />
<br />
Now nearing the final stage of GOTM IX (some where around 1970 now) and got only 1 leaders since then (used it to relocate my palace). <br />
<br />
I can't shake the feeling that the algorithme that calculates weither or not you are rewarded with a leader when attacking with an elite unit is changed, for the worse that is.<br />
<br />
Normally you can count on one leader generated in every war (i.e. some 10-15 turns of battle you wage) but that is no more the case. Tiem to rethink some earlier Civ III strategies I used.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phillip_martin</div><div class="date">Aug 05, 2002, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I was just about to write yesterday to agree about not receiving any leaders in the latest GOTM, and then........ after continuing a marathon war against number 2 last night a have just produced my third GL. :cooool: <br />
<br />
Even though it has been over a period of continuos war from the 12 to 16th century it is what I would expect with a non military Civ.<br />
<br />
The difference a day makes.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MadScot</div><div class="date">Aug 05, 2002, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I too would have said &quot;where the hell are my leaders&quot; until tonight. Two leaders in GOTM 10 at last! :)<br />
<br />
I guess with leaders being such a long odds shot, it's easy to have a dry spell.<br />
<br />
And naming units is cool!!  :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smoking mirror</div><div class="date">Aug 06, 2002, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I confirmed it last night- all armies have blitz- that will certainly make them more usefull.<br />
Iv'e also had two leaders- the first one did take a long time to apear but once I had the epic and tanks (two attacks each turn effectivly doubles your chance of leaders) I soon recieved a great leader.</div></div><hr />

found the things i said had already mentioned by sumthinelse in the &quot;Great Leaders: Everything you always wanted to know&quot; under the &quot;Tutorials, References, &amp; Guides&quot;.<br />
sorry guys... new comer. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hergrom</div><div class="date">Aug 06, 2002, 01:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CB - I think the armies do heal faster now, or rather heal as they did when the game was new.  I think the heal rate got screwed up with 1.21.  In 1.21, I believe the army was healed as 1 unit, whereas now each unit within the army heals individually.  No proof, just my two cents :)<br />
<br />
Also, I have finished another game under 1.29, (tiny, conquest, 4 civs) and I got 3 GL's, which is about right.  I guess it may be more luck based.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">Aug 06, 2002, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hergrom, I too think that on the previous version that only one unit in the army was healing each turn. Glad to see that someone else is having some luck with Great Leaders! I even got one on the defense this GOTM and that is pretty rare for me cause I usually have them cowering while I attack. ;)<br />

<br />
CB <br />
<br />
Something I noticed in this GOTM was that my 3/12 Cav army which was placed in a barracks city to heal took more than one turn. The other single units healed in a turn as expected.<br />
<br />
Not sure why :confused: if all units in an army heal at the same time.<br />
<br />
If I get the opportunity I will check it more closely next time.</div></div><hr />
