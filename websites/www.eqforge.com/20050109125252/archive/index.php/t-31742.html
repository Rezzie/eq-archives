<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Sep 08, 2002, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does anyone have this type of monitor? It seems to have died on me. Ok, here's what happened:<br />
<br />
Just before, Explorer (not Internet Explorer - I'm also using Win98SE) crashed. The monitor then shut off after the system stalled. I turned it back on, and this is were the trouble began. The green light came on, but fizzled out (that is, it was bright green, then dimmed like a flashlight weakening). Then, the brown light came on with a click, went off for about a split second, then came on again with another click. Then, it went off, and paused for a half second, and repeated itself. So, the sequence went like this:<br />
<br />
[ GREEN LIGHT ] - flickering off - (immediately) [ BROWN LIGHT w/1 click ] - turns off for a fraction of a second - [ BROWN LIGHT w/1 click ] - turns off for about 1/2 a second, then starts the brown-light cycle again.<br />
<br />
light:click - light:click - pause - light:click - light:click - pause<br />
<br />
Unplugging it and replugging it didn't help. I was able to install a (much older) monitor, but it doesn't support the resolution needed for Civ3. :(<br />
<br />
So, I'm civ-less for now.</div></div><hr />

I would suggest looking in your monitor's booklet (but who keeps that sucker around??) and look in the troubleshooting guide. Or you could go to their website and look in the FAQ for that model or call their tech support.<br />
<br />
Wishing you luck :)</div></div><hr />

I even looked at an online version. &lt;sarcasm&gt;Yeah, lots of help there. ;)&lt;/sarcasm&gt;<br />
<br />
The only &quot;troubleshooting&quot; it had was &quot;Check the driver&quot; and &quot;Check the connection&quot;. :)</div></div><hr />

I never had a prefrence for any monitor. Right now, my Tatung monitor is installed, but my 3D graphics card doesn't like it one bit. ;) So, it's stuck at 640x480, and refuses to play Civ3. :(</div></div><hr />
