<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2003, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have now finished doing most of terrain improvements in Coresux as specified in the old terrain improvement plan. We also have better a knowledge of geography in Jayneland and Barbaria so the time has come for a new plan.<br />
<br />
In the maps below the letters mean the following:<br />
<br />
I: Irrigation (also used for changing jungle to grassland)<br />
R: Road<br />
F: Farmland (double irrigation for supermarkets)<br />
M: Mine<br />
<br />
There are no squares to transform (=T) for now since it is quicker to chop down trees and double irrigate. Transforming will be done later. Also the R's always mean road; I'll post a seperate 'railroad map' once we discover railroad. There is one exception, we might want to transform Doughnutia's city square to get trade there (Dou is built on a hill).<br />
<br />
Suggested city sites (=C) are shown in the maps, preceded by &quot;B&quot; in Barbaria and &quot;J&quot; in Jayenland.<br />
<br />
No attempt is made to prioritize the terrain improvement in the maps but the following is suggested:<br />
<br />
(1) Doughnutia is the absolute #1 priority.<br />
(2) VM is a high priority because of its potential to become a major trade center second only to Dou.<br />
(3) LC has a high priority since unlike e.g. RF it can't built a harbor.<br />
(4) Neu and LP are having or will soon have food problem so they are a fairly high priority.<br />
<br />
A new build queue poll will be posted tomorrow. There will be a great emphasis on engineers (also libraries and military units in specific cities for invading Greece), we need roughly 10 engineers in Coresux ASAP. In Jayneland the plan calls for 5 new cities so there we need 5. The same is true for Barbaria but there one city must supply everything; the plan will probably call for rush buying 6 engineers in 12 turns in BBF once we finish the current emphasis in science. It is assumed that Berlin will be captured.<br />

Only vote against the terrain improvement plans if you want major changes to them; vote for them if you want only minor changes and indicate below what you want to adjust.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jul 05, 2003, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the plan looks good. Two things about barbaria though: Are we supposed to build the road to Berlin before or after we capture the city, I assume it's the second? I also think we should road the wine in BF, it will increase trade from that square, and it'll be easier to build RR once we get it. It doesn't have shields in abundance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 05, 2003, 08:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Capturing Berlin takes precedence but we haven't discovered tactics so we might start the road before any units head for Berlin.<br />
<br />
Roading the wine hill should be done, I forgot to include road there in the map.<br />
<br />
BTW which ministry decides whether to declare war on barbarians that have a city under their control ? :D The foreign ministry, military advisor or the president ? :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Jul 05, 2003, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My initial reaction was that it would be easier and quicker to Farmland the grass between LC and PB than to do so on the harsher terrain to the NW of LC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedBull</div><div class="date">Jul 06, 2003, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doughnutia is definitely #1 priority...it looks to have potential as a powerhouse production and trade city as long as it's allowed to keep gettin' bigger.  VM is on a prime spot too.  The only minor change I would suggest is to maybe either move or eliminate new city location #3 in Jayneland...the Indian city of Lahore is in position to consume the land inside the planned city radius of that location as it grows, and unless we make getting a city into that spot and getting it big ASAP a really high priority, it'll be hard to establish a city worth building there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2003, 07:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The MODA considers the Indian act of founding the city of Lahore in our territory an act of war and recommends razing that city when the opportunity to do so arises.</div></div><hr />
