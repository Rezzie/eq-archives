<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 01, 2003, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a poll of where to incrementally rush buy (IPRB) stuff and where to switch production from what we are currently producing. There is a separate wonder poll and there will be a third poll of what to build in those cities about to finish what they are currently building.<br />
<br />
I'm also including here one tax-related option: To temporarily increase taxes to maximum (70%) once we have discovered pottery. I strongly recommend we do so, we are in a wonder race and raising taxes increases the odds of success there. We can put more emphasis on science once we have an SSC up and running following this wonder race. Hopefully Sir Leowind isn't unhappy with this :D.<br />
<br />
It should be noted that we have enough cash to IPRB most or all of the stuff included in this poll. However, I recommend keeping some cash reserves, for example I don't think F (IPRB in Naervana) is very important.<br />
<br />
Please note that you can vote for J1 and then either J2 or J3. You can also vote only J2 or J3.<br />
<br />
Here is a map showing the C7/C8 city site referred to in the poll:<br />

C8 is a better site if it's not an oceans square.</div></div><hr />

- Get caravans to doughnutia now!<br />
- E2 Vs. J2.  I voted for both because J2 says &quot;one to core cities&quot;, so the C8/FW area should get roads and a mined special from the FW settler (unless there is a food issue).  An alternative is for the other settler in J2 to stay and improve area around C8, in which case FW might not need to build the settler.<br />
- G: Ipec does not need a camel now, it won't be able to help our wonders - too far away - and we don't really have any good place to deliver it yet.  Build a settler to populate the end of the island.<br />
- C8 is preferable to C7 site <br />
- Voted for K once I saw &quot;once we discover Pottery&quot; - that's critical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
C8 might be an ocean square but if not it's preferrable to C7 (unless it's a mountain, desert or something like that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 01, 2003, 08:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually loaded up the game for the first time in a few weeks to have a look at some of the details<br />
<br />
Thoughts to consider - <br />
If we move the Doughnutia worker from Fish to Silk (recommended and currently winning the poll) I would also suggest moving from the shielded grassland river to forest until the wonders are done.  Because of corruption, the trade arrow from the river is lost anyway, so all you're trading is one food for one sheild, and we need shields the most right now.  Once we get HG in that city, it can grow through celebrations in republic. Food-based growth is not important in that city.  Right now sheilds are most important there, and are certainly worth the cost of one food.<br />
<br />
IRB the camel in PB right away and then build a warrior there quickly for another martial law unit so we can put elvis back to work.<br />
<br />
I need to change my vote on Funxus' Way production.  I see that food is an issue there, so a settler is a long way off.  Build a camel, or maybe better would be a ship or diplomat  Since FW can't build a settler I'd like to see both settlers go towards the C8 peninsula and one should start improving the land and uncovering the special. Also, if I had my druthers, I'd build the city with the LP settler since RF can handle the settler support better right now.<br />
<br />
If Ipecacuanha is switched to a settler, we should move the worker from grassland to ocean for that turn.  It will still give enough sheilds for the settler this turn, but I think that would give us more gold and when the settler is built, it will probably take the Ocean worker instead of the silk worker so if we forget to come back and adjust the city (something I do often), we'll be more likely to continue to work the silk.</div></div><hr />

Once this goal is achieved, a return to current tax levels will be expected.  It is OSR Director Sir Leowind's hope that this inter-departmental cooperation will not be forgotten and will foster increased collaborative planning for the greater glory of our empire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One way to be able to build a settler in FW is if we use the settlers on the hill to clear forest under FW and irrigate GLS. Still, the city wouldn't surplus much, but it has to be done some day for FW to be able to build a settler.</div></div><hr />

This had not occurred to me - seems like an excellent idea. We don't need much food in Doughnutia now, the focus is on wonders. Once we shift our focus towards making that city big we'll maximize food and trade (probably shortly after completing the wonders - we'll need some shields for marketplace, courthouse etc. though).</div></div><hr />

Doughnutia and the 2 Vans is plenty for HG, stay on Fish.  Once HG is built, then the Silk is a good idea. My 0.02<br />
<br />
A. IPRB caravan in Regia Fanatica (recommended)<br />
B. IPRB caravan in Point Blissful (recommended)<br />
C2. Continue with caravan in LP  (for Colossus!)<br />
Not D, Temple in EF in 2 anyway.  Then Van, IPRB 4 * $11<br />
E1. Switch to caravan in FW (recommended)<br />
Not F, Temple in Naervana in 4 anyway.<br />
G1. Switch to settler in Ipec<br />
H2. Continue working fish in Doughnutia - the 2 vans are enough<br />
J. Don't found city on hill ENE of EF (recommended)<br />
J2. One settler ENE to found city C7/C8, one to core cities<br />
K. Taxes temporarily to maximum once we discover pottery<br />
 Mostly, IPRB $11 Vans, 4 more for Colossus, the Lighthouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We need 2 wonders in Doughnutia. The 2 camels only get us the first one. I would still push for more shields there over a couple food.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 03, 2003, 04:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It has 88s, and only one is close enough to deliver this turn. The other one is in LC and we won't be able to deliver it in a few turns. So it's better to get food that counts, then shields that are wasted. I agree with GN:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 03, 2003, 06:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That makes sense, but when we start work on the second wonder, the shields would probably be more valuable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 03, 2003, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since 4 caravans are on their way towards Dou to finish Col, it's probably better to build something else in between, e.g. a dip, and when the caravans arrive Dou start Col and no shields at all are wasted.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">May 03, 2003, 08:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure about the 4 Vans for Dough Colossus.  Unless someone has checked thoroughly, the safety is to prebuild the Wonder wiith the Silk, probably saving a Van.   Fish, HG, Silk Wonder.<br />
<br />
Invest the next RF Van to finish Marco Polo in Neumatic, right?  So we are talking about the next 4 or 5 Vans built.  The 2 existing Vans will soon be consumed in HG.  The next, RF, goes to quickly finish MP? Right?  Mayby not. Then other Vans to build the  Colossus of Dough, via slow delivery without roads.  I'm having second thoughts about sending the RF Van to Neuma MP, but maybe the Tax 70% resolves everything. Not sure.</div></div><hr />
