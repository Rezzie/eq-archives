<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowdale</div><div class="date">Feb 20, 2001, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I posting this new topic, because I read under the GotM thread that a guy had been so unlucky and lost the game - and not because I feel better then everybody els.<br />
I don't know how many of you guy have lost Civ game - Well I think that most of us have tried to get whacked in the first few turns by a passing barbarian or another Civ. But how many have actually lost a real game??<br />
<br />
I remember when I first got Civ1 on my Amiga 500, the first game I played was naturally on Chieftain, and I remember winning by launching my space ship. But I also remember that because I couldn't really see what the SS structural was good for I launched a ship that only had 35% chance of succeeding and took more than 50 year to get there.<br />
<br />
But enough about my first game. For my second game I wanted to go up a level, to warlord, but I also wanted to know more about the game, so I loaded the save game that came with my copy, and looked real good at it. It was a warlord level game and there were five cities on a medium island and the year was 1000 AD. So I thought why not continues this game and I did - I never expanded outside my small island and therefore the Chinese overtook my in the tech race and eventually nukes me. I reloaded the game and try a new approach (expand) and I finally won the game after a very long and exhausting nuclear war.<br />
That was my first and only time I ever played the Zulu's and that was also my first and last real nuclear war.<br />
<br />
But the thing is, that since that game where I actually lost for real I have never ever lost a game of Civ!!! I have played both Civ1 and Civ2 on all levels and never ever been beaten since. And that makes it a bit weird for me to read about others how get beaten by the AI.<br />
<br />
I must admit that I have only played some 10-15 multi player games so when I start on the ladder I'm probably going to get my ***  kicked - but never the AI.<br />
<br />
Could somebody please tell me if it is very common to get beaten by the AI?????<br />
<br />

<br />
I was beaten to space once I think. They launched before me... I launched but i couldn't beat their ETA time. I tried to capture their capital city (to stop the space ship) with nukes. I never even considered the fact that they would have<br />
SDI. So my pre-emptive strike fell flat and they turned my empire into rubble with a counter-strike. Although didn't completely destroy me their space ship beat me to Alpha Centauri.<br />
<br />
And I've had &quot;ties&quot;. Where neither of us made it to space in the time alloted before the game ended (that doesn't happen much to me anymore though)</div></div><hr />

My first try at Prince I finally gave up when I couldn't get ahead of the Sioux in building my spaceship.  But in retrospect, I wasn't really that far behind.  Other than that game, in fact, I've always won either by SS or conquering.  I think maybe one game my SS got to AC after 2020.</div></div><hr />

For me, I've never had my entire civ destroyed except by a passing barbarian in the first ten turns.  For me, &quot;beaten&quot; means that I fell so far behind or am in such a bad position that I just give up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowdale</div><div class="date">Feb 21, 2001, 01:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Fry00 - I have played a lot on Deity and I have always beaten the AI. <br />
The problem with Civ1 &amp; Civ2 is that when you have played enough, you get to know the AI so well that you can hardly lose - it really is very predictable in almost every aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
And to Johan511 - The reason I haven't played very much Civ multi is because I have only recently returned from a very long stay in Thailand and Italy; and I don't actually have my own computer or apartment right now. But that is going to be corrected in the beginning of next month.<br />
<br />
BTW, by &quot;beaten&quot; I mean, lost the game or quite because you could not win.<br />

The AI is even on deity not very strong (to put it in nice words), i cant remember when i lost my last game against comp players. The military nations like greek and mongols do almost no searching for advantages and the science nations like babylonians have so few cities. There are only a few civs which at least try to play in a reasonable way like romans , english and french.</div></div><hr />

Losing a settler in the beginning just makes it harder and frustrating. My moniter has taken lots of beating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does TOO!<br />
<br />
 The barbs and huts are just extra factors, but what I said is true!<br />
<br />
In simple terms, if you lose 1 settler at the start, you lost the 10+ cities, 'spawn' that the settler would have pruduced by the end of the game.<br />

I just couldn't compete with the Ai for some reason. (I've since brought my skills back to an acceptable level for me)<br />
<br />
But it got to the point where I gave up trying to actually WIN the game... My goal switched over to trying to defend my empire from the agressive, powerful and pissed off AI. I refused to allow a computer to beat me on the battlefield. It was actually quite fun but the best i could do victory wise was a stalemate (but the empire was at least intact)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Civilization is a game that can never be repeated in any way whatsoever. There is more chance of lightning hitting the same spot than there is of having a game of civ that turns out even remotely the same as a precvious game.<br />
<br />
Now that we agree on that, are you suggesting that my 2x2=4... theory was a strategy?<br />
<br />
I am not that stupid, sheeeeesh!!!<br />
<br />
I DO realise that the next turn, I may get get 2 wandering nomads, and the next turn after that, the barbarians may take 4 cities.<br />
<br />
The theory I suggested was just a guideline to support the fact that if you lose a settler (in effect you are losing many more). You couldn't possibly disagree with that.<br />
<br />
Further more, my post was directly after and supporting your comment... Sometimes I even quit when they kill a settler in the beginning. 1 settler can mean your destiny in the 4000 years to come.<br />
<br />
In effect your telling me that I am wrong when all I did was elaborate on what you said.<br />

I've also &quot;not won&quot; once. But the AI didn't win that time either. I played an Emperor game on a small map at New Year and had to resort to massive pollution and destroying AI wonder production with an army of spies.<br />

Losing a settler at the beginning or popping a major barbie-hut next to my only city can be frustrating, but it only adds to the fun of the game--after all, CIV is a quasi-historical civilization simulator, and the interesting thing in history for me is how different tribes managed to overcome their particular handicaps to survive.<br />
<br />
But yeah, I've lost two or three times when I kept thinking: &quot;I'll just take a couple more cities, THEN I'll switch my production to SS-building...&quot; When I've lost, these have been my famous last words.<br />
<br />
For those of you who quit early because you lost a settler, or even a city or two, I can only say that, in my opinion, you're missing out on the best part of the game! It's all about survival!<br />
<br />
Except for the recent GOTMs, for the past two years I've only ever played Deity level, with 7 civs, large map, and all other settings on random. I've paid no attention at all to my score, and whether I've managed to max out my population, until the game has been effectively finished (ie, I KNOW I'm going to win). It's difficult, and I've been pretty unlucky a few times with terrain and starting location, etc, but it's so much more satisfying that way.<br />
<br />
Mind you, I haven't played a human opponent yet, but I hope to this summer. Actually, it sounds like I'm in the same situation as you, Shadowdale, when it comes to current living arrangements.</div></div><hr />
