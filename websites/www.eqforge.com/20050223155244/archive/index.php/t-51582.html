<br />
Point Blissful I think should get its warrior RBed, for 8g we'll get 3 more resources for 4 turns - 12 resources of which 4 are food.<br />
<br />
RF probably should start working buffalo to get two more shields and still surplus 2f.<br />
<br />
Where shall we found city with Nae settler, or shall we road with it? I'd like to found a city on the 4 special GLS (silk, fish and gold + one unknown sea) to the east, even if it shares 4 squares with ipec. A city to the west discussed in turn-thread is a channel city, which might be a priority if we decide to build a trireme in EF.<br />
<br />
BTW, today is my anniversary, I signed up exactly one year ago:D <br />
<br />
EDIT: <br />
2 things<br />
The third F2) option should probably be &quot;F3) One more guard first&quot;, meaning you should vote for the F2:s too.<br />
I forgot to add an option for Nae settler improving or roading towards big cities. I think it should found a city though:)</div></div><hr />

I like the settler from there going ewst to found channel city.  A settler out Ipec next can build 4 spceial city.<br />

WD  Funxus, hope u are here for more years to come</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Apr 25, 2003, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really nice poll :goodjob: - I love the detail.  There is a bit of interaction, I may not understand everything yet, but I voted so:<br />
<br />
A1. Buffalo and A2 IPRB $13, Van in 4.<br />
Research Hanging Gardens - Pottery for population growth.<br />
B. LP Settler<br />
C. EF Trireme w Dip Captain, head South or West?<br />
C2. serfs on Whale &amp; Forest, Trireme in 4, then Warrior?<br />
D. LC start Caravan after Temple, new serf on Forest<br />
E. Dou growth, why fish? River? Colossus in 29, not 34.<br />
F. RB $8 Warrior, start Caravan.<br />
G. Naervana one more guard next, or Temple? Not sure.<br />
H. Ipec Settler next, plenty of city sites there.<br />
I. Nae settler head West, Road and city to connect.<br />
<br />
Are we serious about Wonders?  Hanging Gardens?  Then we need to build Caravans.  We can always change a Caravan to Settler later...  And IPRB Vans $11 frequently.<br />
<br />
Regarding Republic, we have 11 supported units, F11 Manufacturing of 35, meaning only a 30% loss.  So at first glance, we have plenty of production for Republic.  We'll need to manage support, but we'll gain content citizens.  We have 4 Temples, building 2, and are planning to get HG, right?<br />
<br />
Could we discuss the details of all actions in this thread now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Apr 26, 2003, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A1, A2<br />
<br />
B: to have two settlers to improve land near our core cities. We should soon start paying attention to irrigation, especially near Neu, LC and Dou, our best cities.<br />
<br />
C: Trireme should head east and then north 'through' a city at city sites C3 or C4 (see city plan map in the 675BC thread (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=51572))<br />
<br />
C2: Siwtch to forest instead of fish to speed production. When we finish the caravan (I think we should IPRB it now or soon - we have cash) we should build a temple in EF, possibly also rush buying it.<br />
<br />
F, F2: Settler to work land near Doug which must grow, grow, grow.<br />
<br />
G: A diplomat, then probably a temple.<br />
<br />
H: Settler should head east and found a city.<br />
<br />
I: Found a city at C3 or C4 (see C (trireme in EF) above.<br />
<br />
<br />
I did not vote for E, our SSC should grow, grow, grow so once LC gets its temple it should rush buy a warrior and send it to Dou. Then it should start caravan (this is also the reason I didn't vote for any of the D's). However, we should consider slowing Doughnutia's growth (not stop it) by switching to the silk now but the reason is to speed up the wonder, not slow the growth.<br />
<br />
An important point reflected above is that we should not hesitate to rush buy stuff, the only reason to have cash is to bribe barbarians so having much more than $60 is simply bad at this time IMO.<br />
<br />
EDIT: We should send the phalanx in LC back to Neumatic ASAP since LC is now well defended while Neu isn't. And we should consider sending the diplomat in LC to the banana square from where it can quickly reach RF, LC or Neu if barbarians show up.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you, as long as we can handle it. I don't have civ2 on this computer, so I can't check the game right now, but iirc it wouldn't be able to support more than 3 citizens at the moment. I'll check how many they can support later:)</div></div><hr />
