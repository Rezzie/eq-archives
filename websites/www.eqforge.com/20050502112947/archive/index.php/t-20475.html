<br />
im upto 1500 AD or so and now my game crashes <br />
<br />
originally thought it was just a settler for some reason (i reloaded the same turn) as it crashed no matter what i did, but when i used 'wait' command, 2 boats later it crashed again <br />
<br />
<br />
is this just bad luck and im screwed or is their something i can do ???? <br />
<br />

Otherwise you could send it to Firaxis. They'll be happy to help you as it also gives them a bug to fix. :)<br />
<br />
But first wait for the patch...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
if i install the patch does that make my game inelligible for GOTM anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Apr 19, 2002, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No. You may play the current GOTM with v1.17f or v1.21f.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">D.K.</div><div class="date">Apr 19, 2002, 08:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Matrix, the patch seems to have fixed the problem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 01, 2002, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mine's doing something similar (I thought it was one of my workers), but it's &quot;hanging&quot; (see my other post in one of the GOTM 6 problems threads) - the button takes 30-120 minutes to blink once! It's almost like there's an infinate loop or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MuddyOne</div><div class="date">May 01, 2002, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had a game crash consistantly before, to fix it I had to revert to the save from a turn before the initial crash.  More FYI since DKs problem is resolved.</div></div><hr />
