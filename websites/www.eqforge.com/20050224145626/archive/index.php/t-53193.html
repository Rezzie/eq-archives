<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">May 12, 2003, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our constitution allows for a system of provinces.  Each province is defined and named by the domestic minister, and is controlled by a governor.  Governors do just about the same job as the dom minister by posting polls, etc, of the cities of their provinces.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this system died out with low participation in DGII.  Now that participation is back up, do we want to reinstitute this system?<br />
<br />
Btw, the particulars can be found in the Constitution. (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=45761)</div></div><hr />

I think the core cities (EF and west on main island)should be one province and the rest another one for the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd support splitting our continent up into two provinces if there is sufficient participation for having governors. But also remember that we will need more governors when we colonize or conquer other continents (having these as separate provinces would be even more important than dividing our continent up into two provinces).<br />
<br />
Dividing it up with EF, LP and the western/core cities as one province and the eastern cities as another would be natural if this were done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure our participation level quite warants creating provinces and governors yet, but if we can make it fly I'm all for it.  A suggestion, however.  Divide our mainland into two provinces for now, but consider merging them into one later in the game when we start getting more provinces to keep the total number of provinces lower.</div></div><hr />
