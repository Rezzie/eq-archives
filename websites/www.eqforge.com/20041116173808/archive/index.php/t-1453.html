<br />
I was wondering what you fellow scenario/modpack creators think of this?<br />
<br />
It sounds like CivIII is going to be CivI with enhanced graphics and gameplay, and with an included scenario editor. This sounds like music in my ears. What do you think?<br />
<br />
You can find Dan Magahas answers here :<br />

Though I read somewhere else that the scenario creation would be very hard, but more important: that it would be impossible to change graphs! And you must admit; even if we had access to the files, it's very hard to make such graphics!<br />

They can still play around with Civ2 style graphics. -So every unit, city style, etc should be editable.<br />
<br />
The one point he had exceptions for, was the terrains, which might be difficult to manipulate, because of the complexity of it. But I'm sure they'll include some doc's on how to access it. But of course, the graphics might be so good, that we wouldn't wish to change it...  http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

People can still search the web for pictures and images and make units of them. They will look better now; there;s no 256 colour limit. <br />
Terrains? Terrains? Hard to alter? Sounds like bad news! Specially for you, Morten!<br />
<br />
BTW, I already created a few events with the knowledge I already posessed. However, where do you suggest the returning crusaders to be placed?<br />

<br />
help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2001, 12:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CMH, -this sounds like a serious palette issue. ALWAYS use a copy of the original GIF files when messing around with the graphics. OR -save the palette from the CivII Gifs, and use this whenever you make new graphics. The first option is probably the easiest way to avoid something like this.<br />
