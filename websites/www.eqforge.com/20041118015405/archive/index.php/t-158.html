<br />
I have a huge civ, and tons of money. There is a size 5 city defended by one musketeer out in the middle of nowhere. 5 units of barbarian dragoons came marching by and decided to conquer my city, but when it conquered it, about 5 NON partisans came out. I quickly recaptured the city, used one to defend, and sent the rest to explore. All of a sudden, a barbarian raiding party comes by and reconquers my city. More NON partisans come out.<br />
<br />
So if I have a special city near a barbarian &quot;generating point&quot;, I can eventually get thousands of NON partisans!</div></div><hr />

Good idea drake! I gotta do that in a mp game sometime. The bad thing is partisans are weak. It will take dozens of them to kill a fortified riflemen.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to get NON ships?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andu Indorin</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2001, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Diplomats and spies can bribe enemy/barbarian ships, as long as they are sufficiently distant from a home city.  This can be done either from a shore or ship-to-ship at sea.  (I always try to bribe a barbarian frigate as early in the game as possible to provide combat support for my trade caravans.)  Oddly enough, you can also bombers that are airborne; talk about an ability to jump high!<br />
<br />
As for thousands of units, the max in the game is 2046.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drake</div><div class="date">Mar 14, 2001, 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a huge MP game right now in which such methods would greatly benefit my second place position so I could make a poke at first. But I can't bring myself to do it....it's just too shady.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As well, sorry to be off-topic, I wish partiasans could 'ambush' units to cause damage, never to destroy, and still surive,much like a spy can.<br />
<br />
Cool technique. There's so much I don't know.http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
