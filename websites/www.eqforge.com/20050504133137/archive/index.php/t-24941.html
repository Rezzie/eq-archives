It seems like you could have done things much easier without them. And if you were going for a domination victory, why wait until the modern age? Maybe you like modern era warfare (I don't), which would make sense. I'm curious - do you speak German, or was that from a reference of some kind? Whatever happened to China in that game? ;) Looks like they were taken out before you even met them. My opening game looked a lot like yours (Hamburg in EXACTLY the same spot), but diverged greatly around the transition from BC to AD. In any case, it was a good read as always. :) I'll have my report up in a few days after I finish the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you have the early save games from about 3000BC and 4000BC so you can use the C#MT gramphos program to do a little diagnostic post mortem. The Chinese with instant archers and double whammy workers should have been a major force in any game on this map.<br />
<br />
Added note: You may also be able to extract some of this infor from your replay file. Of all the infor you have already posted, what happened to China is probably the most interesting and unusual event that shaped the final outcome of your game.</div></div><hr />

[B] why did you fool with all of the MPPs? It seems like you could have done things much easier without them.<br />
Of course, one can always just declare war, but there is no reason to always stand alone. By bringing in other parties, you divide your enemy's defenses.  <br />
<br />
And if you were going for a domination victory, why wait until the modern age? I never play for a specific victory condition. I just play the position. However, I did make a conscious decision to play a builder game once I discovered I could control all the northern lands - German lands by right of discovery, Lebensraum. Germany ended up with twenty-one very strong native cities. <br />
<br />
http://www.crowncity.net/civ3/GOTM8/ad1250-Germany.gif <br />
<br />
The delay also allowed for some interesting analysis of the German unique unit, Panzers, and the German tactic of blitzkrieg, especially in regards to war-time flips.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe you like modern era warfare (I don't), which would make sense.<br />
I like variety. <br />

<br />
This picture from 580AD shows pretty much what happened. They must have got wiped out early. Only Beijing was left alive. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 15, 2002, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again I would ask to see if you have any early save games in the 2000BC range that might reveal what happened.<br />
<br />
This piques my scientific curiosity because my assessment would have had Otto and Mao headed towards a world war for any domination type victory.<br />
<br />
This would definately have to be a Flying monkeys type event if Mao could fail to eat Ghandi for dinner.<br />
<br />
It does go even further to support my contention that after the first 100 turns, players in the GOTM are not playing the same game anymore.<br />
<br />
If I told you that I won the game with Mao's help, you would have said Mao who and in this case it is clear that neither you and/or I had any influence on Mao's fate in the early game.<br />
<br />
ADDED: Your replay sequence in you final game turn will reveal some better clues if you watch with an eye towards this focus.<br />
<br />
In the picture above it doesn't look like Beijing is &quot;alive&quot; in the Chinese sense of the word since Beijing looks like a purple (Indian) city.<br />
<br />
Perhaps a closer look will show that Ghandi waltzed a warrior into an undefended Beijing somewhere around 3500 BC. Seems like Mao committed ritual suicide or the chinese version of harikiri. Just looks very odd in a what the hell caused that sort of way.</div></div><hr />

I always enjoy your summaries, but one area confused me this time around.  A quick overview of the posts in the spoilers thread seems to indicate that a number of the players had some trouble with the raging Barbarian hordes.  You didn't mention much of this in your summary and I was wondering if you had taken specific actions to blunt the barbarian uprisings or if you just didn't run across that many barbarians?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

 <br />
I had my fair share. Ein unglück kommt selten allein, that is, misfortunes never come singly. Here's a horde attacking my settler across a river. <br />
http://www.crowncity.net/civ3/GOTM8/bc0350-Hordes.jpg <br />
<br />
I started making spearmen for every settler by the time of my first settler; plus deployed archers to destroy encampments as soon as practical. <br />
http://www.crowncity.net/civ3/GOTM8/bc2550-FloodPlain-Small.jpg <br />
<br />
Here is an interesting situation. I have a worker on the goldmine, and a spearman on the mountain. The barbarians kept sending attackers and kept dying. This worked a long time until I established Bonn to the southwest in the mountains, and ended that threat once and for all. <br />
http://www.crowncity.net/civ3/GOTM8/bc1175-Barbarians.jpg <br />
<br />
Finally, by spreading my settlements quickly, I reduced the chance of barbarians greatly. The age of hordes ended with the establishment of my twenty-first town, New Konigsberg, in 390AD. <br />

I never used the Civ3MultiTool before. I downloaded it last night. Very interesting. The answer is an alliance between India and Japan captured Beijing in about 110BC. <br />

It makes you wonder why it was different in my game. The only interaction between the two continents is through statistical fluctuations in the randomizer. Very curious, indeed.</div></div><hr />

I just find this incident with China to be the most convincing evidence that I have yet to see displayed, that confirms that the game outcomes may be more significantly impacted by the effects of the Random Number Generator than by things done by the player either on accident or on purpose.<br />
<br />
China's position was perhaps one of the strongest early positions in the game and by all rights, India should have been consumed by Mao's industrious expansion and military might. It would take some extremely bad RNG luck combined with tactical and strategic brain damage to  end up with an extinct China in the early game.<br />
<br />
This does not mean the games are any less fun, it just means that no two players are playing the same game after it has been acted upon by a different sequence of randomly generated outcomes.<br />
<br />
This is part of my contention as to why competitive tournament type games will evolve to set piece scenario type play where the score earned by the player will be set at some fixed time point such as 50 or 100 turns in the future. These set start games will focus the scoring on how well a player plans for and then implements specific strategies versus the current process that tends to favor combination of luck and/or tedious long term milking and micro management.<br />
<br />
We will see these same effects in the new game types released in the XP that will emphasize games that can be completed in a smaller time commitment versus the current 540 turn time sumps that can consume several weeks of time.</div></div><hr />

Absolutely. Wild swings are the natural results of highly complex systems. Small variations in input can create substantially different results. This &quot;chaos&quot; was actually discovered first by a weatherman, meteorologist Edward Lorenz, when a small rounding error was discovered to result in a completely different computed weather pattern. That is where the beauty of a game like Civ3 comes from. Everything may really depend on one nail in one shoe on one horse.<br />

<br />
I usually switch to Republic and stay there, unless I'm religious. But mostly, I like to play a variety of storylines; hence the German Panzers and the Panzer Golden Age. And Otto avoiding foreign entanglements! http://www.crowncity.net/civ3/GOTM8/bc2110-Marriage.htm<br />
<br />
The most important thing to remember is that Civ3 is a strategy game. As such, it is your relations with other Civs that matters. If you control the diplomatic arena and the timing of wars, you will normally win the game. Game mechanics are secondary. The rest is history, as they say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cgannon64</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2002, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks.  I see alot of people tech selling and buying--I've noticed in some write-ups that they don't even research science at all---they just make a load of cash and buy from people.  What's your opinion on this strategy?  I've once tried something similar to this---only I sold techs.  I would push my research rate as high as it could go,  then sell all the techs to other nations. This kept my stockpile of money high, which allowed me to maintain a large army and have science research around 80-90%.  The only problem with this is that it seemed unstable, and the system could collapse at any moment.</div></div><hr />

 how do you balance military and science  <br />
<br />
I normally go straight for currency, sell it, and build marketplaces. I trade for all techs until Republic. Positive cash flow is very important. I usually build marketplaces before libraries. With marketplaces, you can rush libraries. With libraries, you may discover a lot of improvements you can't afford to build. Also, if you fall behind in your finances, you are doomed. If you fall behind in science you can always buy the techs when they become &quot;obsolete.&quot; <br />
<br />
General Settings<br />
90% cash, 10% science,   0% luxuries during Despotism<br />
50% cash, 40% science, 10% luxuries during Republic<br />
 (+/- 10% on each value)<br />
<br />
Another important factor, I think, is number of cities originally settled. If you do not have enough cities, you will not be able to maintain your cash flow at reasonable levels. You need to know if you have parity as soon as the map is revealed or the expansion phase completed (parity depends on level). If you are not in reach of parity, you must attack immediately. If you don't, you will just fall further behind and they will gang up on you like a pack of wolves. <br />
<br />

In German Valor, Germany claimed so much land that it was easier to establish new towns rather than capture them. I avoided war successfully :D until the invention of Panzers, and a German Golden Age. This is not necessarily the best strategy for points. But I figured I had the land, the opportunity for an extended peace (4000BC-1695AD), and I was playing Germany, so I saved up for Panzers. :)</div></div><hr />
