<br />
<br />
 Citizen/Council Spot Votes<br />
 PI precedures<br />
 Executive/Legislative/Judiciary Duties<br />
 More defined info on TC's. <br />
 <br />
<br />
This is just several things the Constitution needs, but currently lacks. We need to define it more.<br />

Bootstoots thread (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=57544) is a start at this, but does not clear up everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so go forward and put up the laws NOW... not later.<br />
<br />
but imho the constitution is not the right place for it...</div></div><hr />

Veera graces us with an apearance for the first time in who knows how long....only to insult the President. WTG Veera :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Octavian, sorry but if you remember correctly, I was very opposed to dropping the CoL and CoS. But everyone else (except you) knew better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">Jul 04, 2003, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@cyc: the idea of dropping them is and was good... but nobody took the pencil and wrote new ones... THAT was bad... people are so lazy if all things work...<br />
<br />
if i remember dg1 correctly, we had EXACTLY the same situation ;-)<br />
only a small constitution, and due to some events people started adding rules to the constitution.<br />
<br />
we have now the chance to SEE the consequences of lazyness, so we NEED LAWS!!!<br />
<br />
the most useless thing to do now is this &quot;i told you before!&quot; bickering ;-)<br />
<br />
go forth and bring some laws to the poll... we do not need to have a complete set, just laws to deal with the most urgent situations....<br />
<br />
our experience in lawmaking shows us that small steps bring us forth, while big steps stall us...<br />
<br />
for example, the one thing we need now as law are:<br />
PI PROCEDURES!!!<br />
<br />
the next thing is:<br />
TURNCHAT RULES (including showstopper-rule for emergency stops)<br />
<br />
the next thing would be:<br />
JUDICAL IMPARTIALITY ASSURANCE (not allowing judical members any other jobs)<br />
<br />
we can then add other things... i would not put all those &quot;urgent&quot; laws into one poll though...</div></div><hr />
