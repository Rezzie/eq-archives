<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Mar 18, 2003, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our primary research goal is set (Monarchy), and Writing is winning out (at the moment) as our alternate tech.  I got the Research Planner utility working, and it has provided some new information we need to consider and decide about.  We are currently researching Ceremonial Burial.  Our next list of choices will be: code of Laws, Horseback Riding, Map Making, and Writing.  Even if we research Code of Laws next, Monarchy will NOT be available the following round, no matter what we research.  That means we either take our alternate tech next round, or we research Code of Laws next round and take our alternate the round after that.  As Code of Laws doesn't really give us anything useful in the game, I would suggest going after our alternate tech next round, Code of Laws after that, then Monarchy.  Vote and discuss (or maybe the other way around :crazyeye: )</div></div><hr />

At this point, that is the biggest advantage of getting Writing.  I doubt we'll be making dips or libraries right away<br />
<br />
Personally, I would go for Code first, so that if we either get a scroll from a hut or get one from a another civ while exploring, we will be able to select Monarchy straight away as the next tech.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  We need Monarchy, and CodeOfLaws is on the path.<br />
<br />
And, we can't bribe as much this game, right?<br />
<br />
Sadly, the vote is way ahead for Writing :(</div></div><hr />

I voted writing first, but when you put it that way I change my mind. So please take one off from the top alternative and add one to the middle.:) <br />
<br />
Maybe we should have some kind of discussion about the archer here too. Shall we pop now? Or shall we wait with it and pop it when we've discovered CoL?</div></div><hr />

Done.  For you and one other who wanted their vote changed.</div></div><hr />
