The idea is that that should deprive the empire of any resources that are being traded from another country and might weaken their possible responses.<br />
<br />
Probably somebody has thought of this already, maybe it is not even practical, but I haven't seen it on the boards.<br />
<br />
Taking the darn capital just moves it to somewhere else, and in my last game, the Egyptians BENEFITTED from my capture of their capital because the new one was much more centrally located.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They really should bring back the Civ2 capital moving system that often but not always occurs (generally occurs only if there is a city nearby, otherwise not)<br />
<br />
It's much more logical in the civ2 system<br />
don't spose you know if the enemy can be split into two still if they are super powerful??<br />
<br />
With the current system they have very little disadvantage from their capital moving..</div></div><hr />

I think that I might not have been clear.  My intent is to deny the empire resources that it gets from trading with OTHER countries.  (Assuming that the AI countries have to be able to trace a trade route to the capital of a foreign power in order to trade resources, this should stop them.) <br />
<br />
In a war against the AI (or event in MP mode if it ever come out for Civ3 :scan: ) the best strategy is to bombard the road/rail on a resource tile they own (be it strategical or luxuires) or if you have unit to spare, sits a unit on the resource tile and then sign up as many trade embargo as possible against them.  This will deprive them of the important resource for making units and also reduce the happiness in a city :D <br />
<br />
A unit of spearman is of not much good against an armor (Ok, ok, I know spearman do kill armor, I lost my armor to a spearman before :cry: ) and war weariness is going to reduce the AI civ into disorder an anarchy.</div></div><hr />
