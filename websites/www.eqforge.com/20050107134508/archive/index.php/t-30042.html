how do I know for sure?</div></div><hr />

If so, search your registry for that string.  Look at the registry keys the string appears in.  Compare it to my post about how programs activate, and delete the key if it is in one of my posted registry locations for how a program can start.<br />
<br />
<br />
If in doubt, Export the key, post it cut and paste with the # function of the edit window  (that will give you mono-spaced text as a quate called &quot;code:&quot;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Smash, take a look at this. <br />
<br />
http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/virusencyclo/default5.asp?VName=WORM_KLEZ.H<br />
<br />
Klez does modify the registry, so you have to clean that up too, something Anti-virus programs don't do.<br />
<br />
There is also a Klez removal tool available there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smash</div><div class="date">Aug 18, 2002, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't believe starlifter hasn't heard of the KLEZ worm.Its very &quot;popular&quot;.Just previewing an e-mail message is enough.I got the one sent by the virus itself so somebody who has my e-mail address somewhere on their machine is unaware  they have it.PLEASE don't put my e-mail address ANYWHERE on your machine ;)<br />
<br />
I used some klez removal utility from d/l.com.Very easy.I tryed the Mcafee site directions but it was unsuccessful and quite complicated.It appears to have worked.I just wondered if there anything I can look for to see if there are any bits and pieces leftover.<br />
<br />
The one I used is made by Kaspersky Lab or something.It even seemed to remove any trace in<br />
system restore.That was somewhat unexpected and time saving as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 18, 2002, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, as I mentioned before,check the Registry.  From the link, here is even more detail for this particular registry search:<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  Click Start&gt;Run, type Regedit then hit the Enter key. <br />
<br />
2.  In the left panel, double click the following:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&gt;Software&gt;Microsoft&gt;Windows<br />
&gt;CurrentVersion&gt;Run<br />
<br />
3.  In the right panel, look for and then delete these registry values. * is any random characters:<br />
<br />
”Wink*” = ”%System%\Wink*.exe” <br />
”WQK” = “%System%\Wqk.exe”<br />
<br />
4.  In the left panel, double click the following:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&gt;System&gt;CurrentControl Set&gt;Services <br />
<br />
5.  Under the Services key, look for and then delete this subkey:<br />
Wink* <br />
<br />
<br />
I would also search the registry for the virus name, just to be sure.<br />
<br />
I avoid most viruses by not using MS E-mail rpoducts, which are outright invitations to have your system messed up.    MS is completely unable to produce a safe E-mail product, and they never have been able to.<br />
<br />
Use Eudora.  It is much safer, much more secure, and it is an industry standard.  All MS E-mail programs are Industry Garbage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
About your virus that MS allowed to infect your machine (Klez)... it is also not possible to propogate with a better  e-mail program like Eudora ( the AV experts say: &quot;this worm uses a vulnerability in HTTP-based email clients like Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express&quot; ).   There are several thousand viruses that attack and spread thru MS E-mail.  None work in Linux, and few can use other e-mail programs to propogate.  <br />
<br />
It is mind-boggling (actually, it make sense when you know MS) that MS is so rich and powerful, yet screws up the PC industry like it does for the last 8 to 12 years... people generally don't even &quot;expect&quot; much, and MS pretends that all this is somehow as natural as the rising sun.... but only MS OS's and programs are hammered by crashes, viruses, etc. to a massive extent... that is because of the inferior underlying design.    It is almost impossible to infect a Linux system with a virus, because Linux simply says &quot;nope&quot;.  The very few viruses that are effective in Linus come from running MS compatible products, in particular Office macros.    Funny how MS can even corrupt other OS's.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, I hope the virus is gone now, Smash.  A defense against many viruses and trojans is to keep a regular eye on your registry (esp. the...\run keys).  I only let 4 programs reside from there, and delete any other program from activation in the Registry.  It sppeds my machine up, allows conscious control (activate the \run programs by clikcin their icons, or else copying the shortcut to the start menu\startup directory, of you want auto start when you boot).<br />
<br />

Then a reboot and ran mcafee and came up clean expcept for Leak Test by Gibson Research which it identifyed as a virus :confused:..I got rid of it anyways.<br />
<br />
I had a look at the regedit but it really doeswn't mean much to me unfortunately.<br />
<br />
This is what I saw:<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/smashregedit.gif<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm think I'm ok now.Gonna go d/l Eudora now methinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 18, 2002, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is teh Eudora download.  I just downloaded the new version myself (I have 5.0.2, and 5.1.1 is current).<br />
<br />
http://www.eudora.com/download/<br />
<br />
The really cool thing about Eudora is that the same program has 3 built in modes:<br />
<br />
1.  Totally free, no ads, but some features disabled.<br />
<br />
2.  Totally free, ads, all features.<br />
<br />
3.  Totally free, paid, all features.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can fully try it out, before buying.  Or use the 2 free modes forever.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have used it for tens of thousands of e-mails for almost  10 years.  I thouroughly understand the OS-level design of both IE and Eudora, and pretty much for Netscape.    Eudora is far far more secure for basic data integrity, and doubly so for backup of data, and changing of users.  But I won't go into tech stuff about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eudora is totally compatible with importing/exporting data, including IE, NS, and Opera.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
@ anyone, not Smash in particular:<br />
<br />
****** READ AND HEED *******<br />
<br />
You can simultaneously maintain several e-mail systems of the **same** account on your machine.... but you have to make sure your e-mail program leaves the mail on the server when it checks e-mail!!<br />
<br />
Example.  You have NS, Outlook, and Eudora.  Assume you're smart, and will never use Outlook again (unless forced to by the Government or your work/school), so you want to try both NS and Eudora.  You plan to always check with NS first, and want to nake sure your 2nd e-mail program can download the same messages, too.  Without long words, here is what you need to do (NS 6.23):<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.com/uploads/CFC_NS_MailSettings1.gif <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note:  Personally, I never allow e-mail programs to delete any mail on any server anytime.  I manually command periodic eradications, as server capacity is reached.  A new ISP I am trying has a web page control that lets me wipe any or all the server stored email easily.  :)<br />
<br />
<br />
In your Browsers, you can easily check the option that makes Eudora the default E-mail program :D.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If E-mail is casual, Outlook is OK for light users, or people that read and delete everything, and don't mind system crashes and viruii.  But if you'll be keeping e-mail for years, or want to avoid all the terrible problems that plague Outlook (and always will, because MS designed it with grave errors), or want really powerful features... the Eudora is the way to go. <br />
<br />
BTW, Pegasus also makes a decent e-mail program, but it is not as industrial strength as Eudora.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have not tried the Opera mail program, and don't plan to, since I already use Eudora.  But Opera's looks promising, though I do not know how it works under the hood.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 18, 2002, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@ Smash:  Your screenshot is almost there.  You need to go to the \run key, and have a look at what is &quot;living&quot; in there:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.com/uploads/CFC_Registry_Run.gif <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You can copy the key data to an icon (shortcut) on your desktop, for these keys (in  \run).  That is because all of of these happen to be programs, not raw data.   <br />
<br />
The main thing is to know what you have in there.<br />
<br />
<br />
A fast way to get to the Run key is use FIND (pull down menu).  There is more than one, but this one does the real &quot;damage&quot; most of the time, since programmers like to put their program activations in this particular location.<br />
<br />
As always, be slow and deliberate when making registry changes.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 19, 2002, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, here is are details:<br />
<br />
The contents of this key (run) are nothing more than programs starting.<br />
<br />
If you copy (cut and paste) the entire data contents of each one to a shortcut (perhaps make on on your desktop, for example), then double click each one after you boot, everything will be the same.  Do not be afraid of this part of the Registry.... no mysterious codes, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing to do is this:<br />
<br />
1. Open Notepad.<br />
2. Backup the text (the name and data) of each key.<br />
3. Delete any keys you don't like.<br />
4. Make shortcuts if you want to activate any/all of them manually (insead of automatically, like HKLM ... Run will do).<br />
5.  I just put any I want to run each time into the Sart Buttin --&gt; Programs --&gt; StartUp directory, and take them out if I want a program not to automatically start.  That's far easier than re-editing the Registry each time!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 19, 2002, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now for some interesting news!!<br />
<br />
My NortonAV 2000 has not shown any viruses on my machine.  I decided today to check with a very good porgram that I have used for over 10 years, called F-Prot.  It is an Anti Virus program.  I downloaded the newest version of the program, and its 19August2002 updates, then ran it on my entire machine, including all archive files (zip, gz, tar, cab, rar, ace, etc.).<br />
<br />
<br />
Guess what.... I was stunned to see I was &quot;infected&quot; by the Klez and the Sircam viruses!!!<br />
<br />
Actually, they were in my Eudora attachment directory, and since Eudora is much much more immune to Viruses than MS outlook.  And guess what?!  Eudora was never even fazed by them.  They never infected my machine at all, they were never activated.<br />
<br />
I double checked this with Fix-It 4.0 Antivirus, which is just a licensed copy of the  Trend Micro engine, whici is very good.  It confirmed the diagnosis.  I no longer rely on Norton exclusively for AV scanning.  :(<br />
<br />
Here (http://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/virusencyclo/default5.asp?VName=WORM_SIRCAM.A)  is Trend Micro's website, alond with the Sircam info.<br />
<br />
Fix-It's website is www.ontrack.com .<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, here are the attachments that were in my attachment directory:<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.com/uploads/CFC_Klez-Sircam_E-Mail_Virus.gif <br />
<br />
<br />
Can you believe it ?!?!?!  <br />
<br />
Waaaay to to EEEurooooraaa!!  Yea!   Eudora is not totally immune to viruses, it is just that MS is so bad, and lots of hackers love to take advantage of it, LOL!!.  F-Prot fixed everything.   Just goes to show... better off without MS E-mail.<br />
<br />
:goodjob:<br />
<br />
Anyway, Not a single file on my machine is damaged, except for these source attachments.  I use Eudora to look at an read e-mails, but I don't activate (double click) or open attachments, unless I know the sources and/or scan first. <br />
<br />
:)  <br />
<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 19, 2002, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is some of the most pertinant info about the KLEZ, which I have copied and shortened from Trend Micro:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WORM_KLEZ<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
<br />
All KLEZ variants, except WORM_KLEZ.B, are mass-mailing worms. They mail themselves to specified addresses by sending SMTP commands to an SMTP server. The worm exploits a vulnerability that opens an executable attachment even in Microsoft Outlook's preview pane. <br />
<br />
WORM_KLEZ.B enables a remote user access to its infected computer.<br />
<br />
All KLEZ variants, except WORM_KLEZ.B, are multi-threaded worms, where each thread performs a predefined task such as network infection or emailing. WORM_KLEZ.B spawns multiple copies of itself in memory.<br />
<br />
I. Propagation<br />
<br />
Where it obtains target email addresses from:<br />
<br />
KLEZ variants .A, .C, and .D obtain recipients from the entries in the default Windows Address Book (WAB). Variants .A, .E, .F, .G, .H, and .I also gather addresses from the following files in the infected computer: MP8, EXE, SCR, PIF, BAT, TXT, HTM, HTML, WAB, DOC, XLS, CPP, C, PAS, MPQ, MPEG, BAK, MP3.<br />
<br />
<br />
The address used in the FROM field:<br />
<br />
Variants A., .C, .D, .E, and .F take the address from a list that is stored in the worm body. The lists changes for each variant.<br />
<br />
Variants .G, .H, and .I obtain email addresses to place in the FROM: field from the infected user's address book. This causes a non-infected user to appear as the person who has sent this worm's malicious email. It does this to hide the real sender of the infected email.<br />
<br />
Mail Subject<br />
<br />
Variants .A, .C, and .D compose the email subject line from a list in the worm's body. This list is the same for each of these three variants.<br />
<br />
Variants .E and .F compose the email subject line from a list in the worm's body. This list is the same for variants .E and .F.<br />
<br />
For variants .G, .H, and .I, the subject of the email is composed in a complex manner, but also taken from a list in the worm's body.<br />
<br />
Mail Body<br />
For variants .A, .C, and .D the message body is as follows:<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to do so,but it's helpless to say sorry.<br />
I want a good job,I must support my parents.<br />
Now you have seen my technical capabilities.<br />
How much my year-salary now? NO more than $5,500.<br />
What do you think of this fact?<br />
Don't call my names,I have no hostility.<br />
Can you help me?<br />
<br />
Variants .E, .F, .G, .H, and .I generate a random mail body<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
II. Payload<br />
<br />
For variants .A, .C. and .D, on the 13th day of any odd month (January, March, May, July, September, November), the worm attempts to execute its destructive payload. For all fixed and remote drives, it overwrites all files with zeros. This worm routine has a bug in generating the drives, however, and therefore fails to perform the task. The size of the original file does not vary. For each drive the worm sleeps for 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
For variants .E and .F, on the 6th day of any odd month, this worm searches the fixed and remote drives for files having the following extensions, and then attempts to overwrite these files with garbage code: TXT, HTM, HTML, WAB DOC, XLS, CPP, C PAS, MPEG, MPG, BAK, MP3, JPG.<br />
<br />
Variants .B, .G, .H, and .I have no payload<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
III. Killing Antivirus Processes in Memory<br />
<br />
Variants .A, .C, and .D kill running processes and occasionally delete the executable files of programs associated with some antivirus products. The list is the same for variants .A, .C, and D.<br />
<br />
Variants .E, .F, .G, .H, and .I kill running processes and occasionally delete executable files of programs associated with some antivirus products. The list is the same for variants .E, .F and .H.<br />
<br />
[b]IV. Network Infection[/]b<br />
<br />
The worm is capable of spreading via shared drives/folders with read/write access. ... For each entry, it copies itself to files with randomly generated filenames. Variants .A, .C, .E, .F, .G, .H, .I are capable of this.  Variants .B and .D are not capable of network infection.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All I can say is Thank the good Lord that He gave me the brains to know not to use outlook for the last 10 years!!  Even Netscape &amp; Opera are immune from these particular viruses, btw.  But you still need to scan for them and delete or fix the infected attachments.  :)</div></div><hr />

Klez and Sircam are both listed in the top 5 viruses, worldwide.  They need the assistance of MS to activate involuntarily, and they need MS to replicate to other machines.  If you activate them after they are downloaded (e.g., double click), they can still do some things on your own machine.<br />
<br />
by Gonzo:<br />
Hehe, use squirrelmail! Webmail for nuts. <br />
Most webmail is pretty secure.  The disadvantage is that it not local, and not long term.  However, with most webmail, you can access it with programs like Eudora and download it from the webmail's server.<br />
<br />
The webmail I use is eudoramail ( www.eudoramail.com ), esp. when I travel.   Yes, eudoramail is by the same people that make the robust industry standard e-mail program, Eudora.  But you don't need one to use the other.  One is a standalone product (Eudora) and the other is a fast, reliable, non-overloaded webmail service (you can  check, download, etc. with almost any stand-alone emailer, like OL, NS, Opera, Eudora, etc.).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, everyone should scan their machine for viruses, and if you are able (and if you download a lot), try and use more than one Virus Scanner!!  <br />

I have used it for tens of thousands of e-mails for almost  10 years.  I thouroughly understand the OS-level design of both IE and Eudora, and pretty much for Netscape.    Eudora is far far more secure for basic data integrity, and doubly so for backup of data, and changing of users.  But I won't go into tech stuff about it. I use Eudora exclusively at work and at home (love the search, filtering, and archiving for the 300+ e-mails I receive daily, plus the multiple profiles and many other things).  Did you know that development for Eudora has stopped completely??  Since basic e-mail isn't changing very quickly, this should go unnoticed for a while, but there will be a day when we'll miss it...:( <br />

I'll stick to my account at squrrelmail and I'll use mail2web (http://www.mail2web.com/cgi-bin/login.asp?lid=0&amp;il=0)<br />
