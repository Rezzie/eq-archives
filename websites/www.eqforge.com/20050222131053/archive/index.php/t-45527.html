I'm away from Saturday 1 March for a week. It's Lucy's first birthday and we're taking her to Disneyland Paris! :D<br />
<br />
Hopefully you'll carry on organizing the next game without me!</div></div><hr />

I've PMed DvR, and think he'll be allright. Once our cities are settled, and the production is set, the domestic advisor won't have very much to do.:)</div></div><hr />

Given that I don't usually get here on the weekends, that means I will effectively be gone from this Saturday until Wed.  IF I get elected to a position, my deputy will need to assume duties for the first play, as I will not even know I've been elected until probably after the first turns are played:crazyeye: I'll do my best to make that known, but would appreciate someone (DoM?) making sure a deputy is informed should that situation arise.  Thanks much</div></div><hr />

South Africa is one of the oddest countries I've ever visited when it comes to the society. The thing with the segregation...<br />
but food was cheap though, I gained almost 3 kilos, just like the rest of my family, and all the food we ate was good.<br />
Well, I'm back on duty as DA, and CG is my deputy:)</div></div><hr />

...well actually it's the afternoon, and it's Friday. But anyway, I shall be away for 10 days or so. I'll post when I get back. In the meantime Deputy Foreign Advisor puglover will be taking over.</div></div><hr />

I don't have a science deputy, so someone will have to pay attention to this during that time.  I might be able to peek at the boards once in a while but I definitely won't have the game or any of my spreadsheets and such with me.<br />
<br />
Frankly with all the war plans (and the fairly leisurly pace of the last couple turns) there hasn't been much for the science ministry to worry about lately, so it may not even be much of a big deal.</div></div><hr />

Work has gotten busier, I was away on vacation for a week, and will be starting school in about a month, so I'll probably not be around very much in the future :(  This has been great fun, and looks like the empire is progressing very nicely.  I'll try to at least keep up on the turn threads so I can celebrate our eventual victory with you all.</div></div><hr />

I am Back to the Civ2 Demogame. I returned and I noticed I missed the Nominations :(. I am looking for a Deputy Possition I see no reason why CivGeneral can't act as Deputy Science Minister while I'm out.</div></div><hr />

Dang, I should realy spend time partisipating in both Civ3 DG and the Civ2 DG. Now I have missed the elections, again. I am currently trying to hold a possition for Military Deputy untill the next Elections. I am sorry for going AWOL and I will devote most of my time in the Civ2 DG.</div></div><hr />
