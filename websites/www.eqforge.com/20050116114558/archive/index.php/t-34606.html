<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Oct 20, 2002, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yesterday, while searching some information about Lindows, I found the homepage of Winlinux. It's actually a Linux that can run all windows programs. Contrary to (the excellent, though) VMWare, it seems that it's not an x86 emulation engine so the performances are great. The only drawback is that Winlinux is not free. But that shouldn't be a problem, since it's not too expensive and looks pretty good.<br />
<br />
Ah sorry, forgot the link: http://www.winlinux.net<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: btw, I saw a friend running linux and VMWare, playing counterstrike. Guess what, it runs faster than on a windows powered machine. Actually he had a MP Athlon, and since Linux is MP aware, that explains a lot... Also, just slipping to VMWare: it is really amazing. Imagine, it emulates a machine with &quot;only&quot; 100meg RAM and it loads windows XP much faster than a real PC with 256MB! Incredible but I saw it really. I guess their memory management is excellent. wow.</div></div><hr />
