<br />
Gives the feeling that Snipers are out there and there's no where to hide!<br />
<br />
<br />
Flamethrowers are excellent as well. Nemo used them in SecondFront by puuting them in the partisan slot, giving it a bonus against 0-move 'bunker' units. Very realistic.<br />
<br />
I have Flamethrowers for both Germans and Soviets in my Stalingrad scenario. They are both never-before-seen units. I have some other interesting things going on in terms of missle units, so I may not incorporate the 'sniper's bullet' idea; though I hereby put my ™ on it! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

Anyway, I have a WWII scenarios that i created, I made a sniper unit. It worked really well, the AI used too, they always use the good ones and shun the bad ones.<br />
<br />
It was like a 6:1:1 2,1 And it wasn't detroyed after attacking.<br />
<br />
I give the idea a thumbs up.<br />

The Sniper!<br />
Hey can have the ability of the submarine, they can't be seen by most units. Maybe only other snipers can see them......<br />
Give me suggestions?<br />

I don't think either side used the sniper in combat. Just immagine: a sniper trying to knock down an entire regiment of the German Wehrmacht.<br />
<br />
However, it could be of use in a terrorism scenario, but then, a lot of such scenarios already have a sniper in 'em.<br />

In Holland we hyave a different name for those two types of snipers (scherschutter (sharpshooter) and sluipschutter (someone who hides in buildings and shoots at people on the street). But those 'snipers' were just German soldiers hiding in left buoldings, waiting for the enemy to cross the street and shoot him. This tactic was only used by the Germans when they were in the defence (so basically Stalingrad and later). It was used against tanks as well; the soldiers hide in a building with a anti-tank gun, you know the rest....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 15, 2001, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But if the sniper is used together with FMK's bullet units, it could work - but not for the AI as the bullets would not automatically follow the sniper as they would for a sea submarine.<br />
<br />
The bullet could have low attack and low cost but good range.</div></div><hr />

Now we have the bullets themselves as units.. Can see this being of use in WWII scen's where a city or unit or tactical objective or turnip field has been overrun, with snipers arising to boldly blast at the foe in much the same manner as partisans( who, lets face it, require a bit of a rest, popping up everywhere as they do. Anyway, the drab black uniforms of the little dears does get a little droll after a while)<br />
<br />
What a good sniper unit needs, in MMHO, is more than just cruise missile style bullets (aside: oh tish pish posh) but a whole overhaul! Give em proper invisibilty , and for that matter make truly stealthy aircraft, subs, snipers, grocers, and SAS/spetznaz ( ones own little predilection)! Also, use them to affect the events file, so particularly persistent or successful http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/snipersmilie.gif cause lack of moral, withdrawal, or conversely the sending in of reinforcements (indeed, from either side)<br />
One good, well trained soldier with a rifle can work wonders- just look a the Dallas Book Depository in 63! The game should perhaps mirror this effect!<br />

This made the German sniper shoot in that direction, giving his hiding spot away. The Russian sniper easily picked him off. He was 18, too.<br />
