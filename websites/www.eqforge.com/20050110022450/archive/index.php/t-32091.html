Most of the hardware of my computer was replaced because of the damage. <br />
<br />
Just now I was just shutting down Kazaa when the lines appeared again. <br />
<br />
Does anyone know what the green lines are to do with?<br />
<br />
p.s. I have Windows ME<br />
<br />
p.s.s. Break the bad news softly :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pillager</div><div class="date">Sep 16, 2002, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, that sounds more like a monitor or video card problem. <br />
<br />
Why did having a virus mean you had to change your hardware?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perfection</div><div class="date">Sep 16, 2002, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its either your display system, (moniter, video card) or your virus resurfaced through an unreplaced harddrive or a CDRW cd that has been infected</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Sep 16, 2002, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Try using the monitor on another computer, and see what happens. AFAIK, viruses can only change the settings on hardware chips. I don't think they can put a virus in hardware.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perfection</div><div class="date">Sep 16, 2002, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your right chieftess they can't.  I agree borrow a friends moniter and if it works get a new one, or you could go to your local computer joint pick up a new video cable and plice it with your old one,  it worked for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">redtom</div><div class="date">Sep 16, 2002, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was the win95chi virus.<br />
<br />
Can a virus affect the monitor? I thought it was like a TV to a video player</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perfection</div><div class="date">Sep 16, 2002, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No it can't effect the moniter but the damage could just be coincidental</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">redtom</div><div class="date">Sep 17, 2002, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It only occasionally happens when the computer disconnects. Just a minute ago the computer disconnected due to BTOpenworld's annoying two hour timer and the lines appeared but the screen didn't turn black, it was back to normal in less than a minute</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Sep 17, 2002, 11:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is a video card problem, related to either the drivers or the actual settings.<br />
<br />
If you have the latest drivers, try going down with the refresh rate and if you can alter it, the clock speed of the card as well. There are several programs for most newer video cards to alter these settings.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perfection</div><div class="date">Sep 17, 2002, 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I agree lucky but I still think it might be the moniter,  I would check it out before buying a new video card</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">redtom</div><div class="date">Sep 18, 2002, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well its not a virus and only happens occasionally, i'm not going through the stress of phoning up the computer geezers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perfection</div><div class="date">Sep 18, 2002, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Do you have another moniter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">redtom</div><div class="date">Sep 18, 2002, 05:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, but I still reckon, its to do with the drivers of the modem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Perfection</div><div class="date">Sep 18, 2002, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The modem?  Whats that got to do with green lines?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CornMaster</div><div class="date">Sep 18, 2002, 11:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a mouse that conflicted with the modem.  So crazy stuff can happen. :)<br />
<br />
Green Lines is usually a video card issue.  Happened to me with my TNT2 in Win98.  The problem went away when I changed to XP.  So I don't know how to solve it directly, however....if it's just when you disconnect from the internet (and a program closes)...then it's probably the program and not the modem.<br />
<br />
Of course....if it's not a program...then IT COULD be the modem driver/video driver conflict.<br />
<br />
What modem and video card do you have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Sep 19, 2002, 11:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My uncle's mouse conflicted with the modem once. It looked weird, since whenever you moved the mouse, it would display ASCII characters in the terminal window. :) I also have a network card that's conflicts with the sound card. So, it's possible that two devices can conflict.<br />
<br />
Go into your control panel, and look at your system settings. There's an option that shows all of your hardware. It might be a bit time consuming, but check to see that the IRQ ports don't conflict. Some times, it won't tell you they conflict, even when two devices are accessing the same port (like my sound card and network card).</div></div><hr />

I've experienced the same symptom when working on a Dell laptop a couple of years ago.  The resolution was a BIOS update from Dell.<br />
<br />
Worth trying...</div></div><hr />

This is straight out of a tech support guy's nightmare. <br />
<br />
I should know, I happen to be one ;)<br />
<br />
I had similar problem with my video card (GF2) once. Changing drivers usually helps.</div></div><hr />
