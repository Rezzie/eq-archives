<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">hgengstrom</div><div class="date">Mar 01, 2001, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was trying to attack a city and use an engineer to build a fortress next to it that I could use as a base for my attacks but a defender would destroy my engineer and defender each time.<br />
<br />
Finally, I had one building a mine while he was waiting for his turn to go.  I turned that task off, moved him in with a defender, and he built the fort immediately.  I then rushed in several additional units to this new fortress.<br />
<br />
Apparently, the engineer had stored up units of work while it was building the mine and was able to expend them on the fort.  I had heard this was possible but I didn't realize it would allow you to change the type of task it was doing.<br />
<br />
Anyway, now I can charge up an engineer before I send him into a dangerous spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stormerne</div><div class="date">Mar 01, 2001, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You will find this exact technique described in the CivFanatics War Academy... http://www.civfanatics.com/civ2scrolls.shtml#speedup <br />
<br />
I also recommend using armies of engineers for a technique I've described several times elsewhere. You can use this to take over a city (or several cities) in a single turn. Assuming hospitable terrain (grass, plains, deset or tundra), move engineer1 towards city, build road (road appears), move engineer2 onto new road, build railroad, move engineer3 onto new road with engineer2, build railroad (railroad appears). Repeat with next three engineers. Stop when you're at the city gates. Move in the heavy weaponry and pound until city is yours. All in one turn. No need to build a fortress unless you suspect partisans will attack your troops left outside after you've taken the city.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andu Indorin</div><div class="date">Mar 08, 2001, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Another useful technique for using engineers with &quot;stored work points&quot; is for bridging operations and transforming roads into railroads in hills, forests, and swamps.<br />
Often the computer civ will have built a road into such terrain, but has not yet built a railroad.  Normally, you cannot turn a road into a railroad over a river in hills, etc. in less than two turns; but engineers with sufficient stored work points can do this.  Then bring on the howitzers!  <br />
<br />
Before engaging in a major invasion of an enemy civ who I am going to take out of action, I will commit a dozen or so engineers to preparing for this invasion by transforming terrain in my territory for 3 to 6 turns prior to the invasion.  (You can think of this as &quot;training&quot; your civilian engineers to become &quot;combat engineers.&quot;) Usually the number is dependent on my reconnaissance of enemy territory through the use of diplomats/spies.  Once in action, these engineers allow me keep up the pace of my blitzkrieg through enemy territory. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kev</div><div class="date">Mar 08, 2001, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have an engineer question that is somewhat related in this thread:<br />
<br />
Is there a maximum amount of engineers that can be working on any single project after which additional ones make no difference?<br />
<br />
For example: I know that two egineers will irrigate away a swamp quicker than just one.  But will 20 all doing the same thing do this is like one turn?  Is there some point where more engineers provide no help?  Same question with changing the nature of the terrain - from mountains to hills,etc.<br />
<br />
Just curious.<br />

Andu this sounds like a great idea...I <br />

I would have never thought to try anything like this. It's amazing what people have tried with this game. You can learn new things on a weekly basis, which is amazing for such an old game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Mar 09, 2001, 11:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Has anyone put together a list of how many turns it takes an engineer (or settler) to perform the various tasks (and on various terrain) so we know how many turns to store up, and we don't accidently waste them by, say, completing the fortress/mine/transform/whatever, instead of interrupting them before they finish?<br />
<br />
Also, how does a unit's remaining movement points factor into this... Say a settler or an engineer has 1/3 movement point left when you set them to do something.   Do they apply a full turn to their task? or just a partial turn?  or no turns? etc.<br />

<br />
I keep hearing people talk about having scores or even hundreds of engineers running around.  I rarely seem to have enough food to support more than a couple dozen without crippling my big production or trade cities.<br />
<br />
How do you guys do it?!<br />
