We build a couple of Warriors and send them out to explore. We should research Bronze Working first so that we can build up some Phaixes (Hoplites) for our defenses.</div></div><hr />

The plan sounds good CG.  Just remember, foreign affairs does the exploration work.</div></div><hr />

Feck the prime directive! When we encounter a larger expansive civ we should attempt to make peace with them, block them in some forward cities and hold them in place for experimentation! :satan: <br />
<br />
With the aquisition of Marco Polos embassy we will know where everyone is (map trading), making exploration easier and military conquest that much quicker. The military advisor could use their influence in parliement to press the issue under the guise of increased concern about the nations trade industry! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shahadet</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2003, 08:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see why we should build Phalanxes so early on. There are plenty of huts to give us more powerful units and the shields could be better spent on settlers for more cities. I recommend producing two warriors from the first city then a settler. The second warrior should be ready just before it hits size 2 so it can control any unrest. The same should go for the second city. As I said before Marco Polos wonder is a great asset to exploration and should be obtained as early as possibly. Maybe before hanging gardens or pyramids?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2003, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion phalanxes suck !! Early on I like 'defending' against hostilities using high attack units with two movement points (horsemen at first and then chariots and then elephants) to kill any enemies before they get the chance to attack. I usually do not build defensive units (except for warriors for riot control) until I can build pikemen and especially musketeers. An exception might be phalanxes on mountaintops.</div></div><hr />

Once it has some value worth guarding.  After many turns, we'll only build Phalanx, when we are rich and capable and have value - and our enemies are dangerous.  And even then, won't we use Diplomats to guard against the barbarians?  Or don't I understand the Rules?</div></div><hr />

I have rarely (never ?) seen barbarian units with two movement points arrive from the sea and attack on the turn they appear near the start of the game. Early on barbarian triremes usually carry archers. This means there is always at least one turn to respond to barbarian threats and the response I like is either bribing them or killing them with a high-attack unit like chariot, elephant or (very early) horsemen. I don't like allowing them to attack first - phalanxes easily get killed by archers and chariots (unless they are on a mountain/hill).</div></div><hr />

There is no bonus for when they are defending, so, whenever possible, attack the barbarians unless we are confident the defending unit can handle the attacker.</div></div><hr />

I still never really found anywhere that has proven/tested this....?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And also, the barbs attack is multiplied by 1.5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Mar 14, 2003, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I've seen that and looked at his links to the Barb calcs as well.  Even there it is just stated.  I haven't gone much past that....  In practice it seems to be the case, horsemen and even warriors can readily attack and kill Barb Archers, but I haven't seen any actual game programming to prove it is the case.  Doesn't really matter much though....  with the attack bonus the Barsb get, it is definatley best to attack them whenever possible.</div></div><hr />

With the barb bonuses a non-vet chariot will kill a veteran fortified phalanx 50% of the time, and we probably won't have veterans for a little while.</div></div><hr />

The problem I see with this is that since barbarian archers/chariots can kill phalanxes fairly easily our cities can get reduced in size from barbarian attacks unless we have city walls which are very expensive to build early on. Having two high-attack units with a movement of two is better than two phalanxes IMHO, and one high-attack unit is often sufficient (whether it is sufficient depends on geography plus various other factors). And of course a few diplomats are always very nice to have since noone can resist a fistful of $$ ;)</div></div><hr />

That's what I meant to express, however, rereading my post I see it doesn't say that. :crazyeye:<br />
Until chivalry even 2 horsemen will by sufficient to defend a city from barbs most of the time.</div></div><hr />

The case for two-move attack units and diplos as defense makes good sense to me.  The problem is that no-one is voting for HBR in the science polls, so where do these 2-move units come from?<br />
<br />
And perhaps not in the early game, but I have regularly seen barbs land and attack in the same turn.  Not as often as when they land and give you a chance to attack first, but it does happen.</div></div><hr />

Well, it looks like writing is winning as alternate tech, from hut units, hut techs and bribed barbs, we should be able to get some 2 move units.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shahadet</div><div class="date">Mar 15, 2003, 08:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">With some luck huts will provide us with some chariots and/or horsemen. 1 or 2 hut units should be sufficent to guard the empire against barbs in the early game. Later on we should have discovered writing so as to bribe units and reduce the cost by capturing leaders. If at all possible the tech advances should not be bogged down with advances like horseback riding until absolutely necessary. However this depends ultimately on what game strategy we will be going for. Is it a total war of AC landing game?</div></div><hr />

There, post edited. :D<br />
I was only here for the first game, and I thought we won the last one by spaceship too for some reason.</div></div><hr />

Should a decision not be made now as to what way we are going to win this game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Mar 15, 2003, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it pretty much depend on. E.g. how well we are doing in science compared to the AI, or how strong the AI is militarily. Last game, we would've been able to do both IMO.:)</div></div><hr />
