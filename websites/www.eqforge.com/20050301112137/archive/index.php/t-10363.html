Ok, I recently captured an Indian cities two or three turns ago.  After the attack the city was reduced to five.  I stationed twelve troops a mixture of infantry, cavalry, artillery, fighter and a bomber.  The resistence was quelled within two turns.  But then to my surprise a couple of turns later the city revolted against me and I lost all my units.  By this time I had made peace with India and my culture was far superior.  The city was was surrounded by north to my cities and south to the Indians so i wasn't in the middle of his territory.  However I was fairly close to his capital .  <br />

What I want to know what are the factors affecting cities revolvting against you?  <br />

Don't capture cities that are surrounded unless youthrow upa temple and other culture improvements FAST</div></div><hr />

I agree, building a temple will probably help.  Courthouses supposedely reduce the chances of a city revolting as well.</div></div><hr />
