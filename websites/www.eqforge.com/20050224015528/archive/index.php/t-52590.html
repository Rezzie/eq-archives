<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 05, 2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think there are many things that need to be changed now since relatively few cities are about to finish what they are producing. Also only 5 turns were played.<br />
<br />
LP is about to finish a trireme. I recommend a diplomat next to explore to the north. While waiting for the diplomat to be ready the trireme can explore a bit in the north and then return to get the diplomat.<br />
<br />
LC should start another caravan but we might want to switch to a settler a few turns from now depending on how events unfold. I recommend to build a settler next in PB, we need to start improving the land around our Doughnutia ASAP.<br />
<br />
FW can't grow now so it should switch to the shielded grassland square.<br />
<br />
We should be able to get MPE unless something disastrous happens so switching from the forest square to the fish in Neumatic is an option, we want that city to grow.<br />
<br />
If we get $$ from the barbarians and we do not have any unexpected problems we should consider to IPRB a settler in one of our eastern cities (probably Naervana) a few turns from now.<br />
<br />
I recommend maximum taxes for a few more turns (possibly about 5) to be followed by maximizing science.<br />
<br />
As usual, all settlers to Doughnutia. We want the colossus ASAP. Once it's finished we'll want a marketplace (to increase trade) and courthouse (to reduce corruption). In a few turns we'll need to decide which one first.<br />
<br />
I'm not recommending rush buying anything now.<br />
<br />
I tried to shorten the poll by omitting stuff like &quot;X1. Change Y to Z&quot; and &quot;X2. Leave Y as is&quot; with the exception of C1/C2 - this is something I'm unsure of myself so I want an unambiguous result. Please note that you can vote for either E1 or E2 or neither (which implies &quot;don't change anything now in Doughnutia).<br />
<br />
I recommend keeping taxes at maximum for a few more turns until we are absolutely sure to get both the Colossus and MPE. The caravan arrival times in Dou may get slightly delayed because of the barbarians.<br />
<br />
Feel free to make additional suggestions if something seems missing from the poll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 05, 2003, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A.  Voted yes, but you might consider the following as well - Move EF worker from whale to fish (EF will produce 5s/turn), then put FW worker on whale.  Both cities get more food that way, FW gets more sheilds (albiet at the expense of EF) and perhaps more importanly, overall trade is not reduced.<br />
<br />
B. Of course! That's what micromanaging is all about!  ;) Just don't forget to move back before the city starves.<br />
<br />
C2 - keep working forest for shields.  As long as we get cities to size 3, growth should be from celebrations soon.  FW needs the food to grow but it's less important here.  Keep production up for the wonders. (Also note that I suggested to use that fish for the EF/FW whale swap in my notes for &quot;A&quot; above, so I've got ulterior motives :mischief: )<br />
<br />
D. Not sure...city growth is so stunted I would tend to lean against this, but consider my lack of a vote more of an abstention rather than a vote against.  Don't have a strong feeling one way or the other.<br />
<br />
E. No change is 3f, 5g, 2b and 6s<br />
E2 gives 1f, 6g, 2b, 7s which is better<br />
but E1 gives the same thing with one more food (2f, 6g, 2b, 7s) so it is clearly superior.  You give up 1 food for 1g + 1s.  With the celebration from HG, it is most efficient to work the three specials.  When we get a settler down there, we shouldn't take long before we figure out what that 4th special is.<br />
<br />
F.  I don't think this is too important immediately- maybe soon, but it's not urgent<br />
<br />
G  Ships need Dips<br />
<br />
H.  Sure why not.<br />
<br />
I. That's the safe thing to do while pushing for the wonders, but don't do it much longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blissful_Zen</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 12:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted for pretty much everything you 2 before me did.<br />
<br />
I hope, funxus, you plan on loading that Van on the ship next turn... as to have it out of danger... and it will get to doughnutia much faster.  <br />
<br />
I dont think we should  mountain jump...let see what they do, we may be able to get another archer out of this...keep the dip around but safe.  Once the lone archer is dead...have it head to banana as planned.  If we dont mind bribin the archer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should we build something in Dou before the  wonder? Maybe start a MP, and then RB (I'll plan it to not lose many shields if so) it before it's complete.<br />
<br />
Can't we build dip in RF?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 03:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, go straight for the wonder in Dou. Building a MP either delays the colossus or means spending cash rush buying. Both are too risky for my taste if we really want an SSC.<br />
<br />
Tim's alternative to option A in the poll is interesting.<br />
<br />
A dip in RF is an option as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We agreed to max taxes until Pottery was discovered, now we want to continue it?  I'm not sure why.  Our science is dying, we can get money from the barbs (especially if we don't spend more bribing them).  Has anyone else started Colossus or HG?  We have caravans on the way.  Once HG is finished, start Colossus right away and keep the 'vans coming, and I think we'll be fine, unless there is reason to believe another Civ is close to achieving it.  Unless someone can convince me otherwise, the OSR will begin advocating for a return to higher science levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I generally always build the city before clearing the terrain.  Unless its a case where the city wil starve because of it, get the city built first so it's producing shileds and trade, then let another settler clear the terrain later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far, there are only three wonders being built by the AI, and that's three pyramids. <br />
<br />
 Once HG is finished, start Colossus right away and keep the 'vans coming, and I think we'll be fine, unless there is reason to believe another Civ is close to achieving it. <br />
HG was just finished, and nothing else has been started yet in Dou. There are four caravans on the way to Dou, but if we use three of them we can finish the other 50 in 6 turns. The last caravan, and all other caravans produced will move to Dou and stored there until next wonder (Cops?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 06, 2003, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Our biggest possible problem may be if the barbarians head for PB and temporarily block the caravan route from LC to Dou. If this doesn't happen and we get the barbarian leader we can set science to maximum the moment it happens.<br />
<br />
The AI civs that are building wonders are all building the pyramids but once one if them finishes the others will switch to something else (HG, Oracle, LH, GW, GL or MPE).<br />
<br />
We have 7 temples worth a total of $280. So once three caravans have reached Dou we can lower the taxes. Then we'll also face the question of whether to store possible surplus caravans until later or use some of them to establish trade routes in Dou.<br />
<br />
Looks this tax/science discussion may be the first issue that causes a real disagreement in the government :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">May 07, 2003, 09:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love this kind of poll, and the discussion above :goodjob: .<br />
<br />
A. Switch from ocean to shielded grassland in FW , grow :)<br />
B. Switch to forest for one turn in LP to get trireme next turn<br />
?C1. Switch from forest to fish in Neumatic <br />
D. Build settler next in Point Blissful - W Road then LC to Dough.<br />
E2. Switch from fish to silk in Doughnutia <br />
?F. Irrigate Neumatic city square now - after Roading to it.<br />
G. Build diplomat next in LP - Ships need a Dip Captain.<br />
H. Clear jungle before founding city at C8 (recommended) <br />
?I. Keep taxes at maximum for roughly 5 more turns  Why?<br />
<br />
I did not vote C1 nor F nor I.  Road, W Road,  then F) Irrg Neumatic city square.  Regarding C1, if E2 carries we only need 3 Vans at Dough and the other can finish MPE, hence C1 Fish. <br />
I? Perhaps a bit more gold, we are nervous about Wonders, eh?</div></div><hr />
