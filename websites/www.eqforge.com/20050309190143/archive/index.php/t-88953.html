<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scoutsout</div><div class="date">May 23, 2004, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a little while ago I wanted to check an article in the War Academy, so I surfed over to the main site.  After experiencing some problems earlier this week, I have installed spybot and javacool's SpyWare Guard.  When I got on the War Academy page, I got the popup (which I expected) and then a series of warnings about a browser hijack attempt.  I think the popup was Classmates.com, but I'm not sure (I closed it pretty quickly).  I took a screencap, but it's a few kb over the upload limit.  I may resize it and post it if it will help...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dell19</div><div class="date">May 24, 2004, 04:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you save it as a .jpg you should be able to upload it to a post, iof thats what you have already done then you can use the upload link at the bottom of every page to upload a slightly too large file and then use IMG tags to post the image.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">scoutsout</div><div class="date">May 24, 2004, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately, the screencap is at home, and I'm at the office.  I won't be able to mess with any of this until this evening.  I'm fairly certain that the classmates.com popup was the one that popped up when I loaded the War Academy page.  I also got some script errors indicating that there were problems with a script.  I can't recall if it was a java or activeX script though.  I know that when I installed spybot it &quot;vaccinated&quot; the sytem, putting up specific blocks for some 1,500 known spyware things...  <br />
<br />
I know you site admins are doing what they can to prevent this kind of thing from happening, and I do hope Telefragged is putting language into their advertising contracts to give them some recourse against advertisers who behave in this manner.  <br />
<br />
The real shame of it is that I am now reluctant to refer anybody to War Academy articles (or to re-read those articles myself).  This behaviour is devaluing what is probably the single best part of the 'main site'.</div></div><hr />
