<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exsanguination</div><div class="date">Sep 26, 2002, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going crazy! Everytime I try to make something nice and fancy using either Jasc PSP 7 or Adobe PS6, I end up finding that need a tool the other one has!!!<br />
<br />
Example: I'm trying to create a picture with Bismarck as Layer 1, and a Panzer Attack frame (acquried through Flicster) as Layer 2. I want Layer 2 to be around 50-60% transparent (or opaque as they call it). I'm using PSP7 to do this since PS6 does NOT have to invaluable Ctrl+T selection tool. All it has is the bloody magic wand which worth about as much as a sack of stool :rolleyes:.<br />
<br />
BUT! Wait a second... I can't paste my Panzer selection as a new layer! Why? Who knows! Sooooooo... I go into PS6 (a program I am much more fluent in) and try to copy that same selection on to Bizzy. But lo and behold! It pastes the whole damn picture, not the selection I acquired through PSP7! <br />
<br />
Accordingly, I make all the feeble attempts possible to take that same picture I Ctrl+T'ed in PSP7 and make the selection I wanted. Of course, PS6 does not offer such convienences. So, I am stuck! Blasted!!!!! <br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to accomplish what I want? I want to simply get that damn Panzer on to Bizzy picture, while being transparent at the same time so it doesn't look so odd (I wanna so the same with X-Man and his Immortals but lets go one step at a time). I tried this with each file as a pcx, and then with each as a jpg. Any solutions? How the **** do I paste as new layers in PSP7 (I've NEVER been able to do that)?<br />
<br />
As you can see, where one is convienent, the other ISN'T. Or I am just lacking the right knowledge :(. HELP ME!!!<br />
<br />
(is this the right forum to post this?)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArmOrAttAk</div><div class="date">Sep 27, 2002, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey I know what you're trying to do. One day I was playing with PSP making selections, pasting onto another picture, not replacing the backround laying on top like you said. It was all pretty easy. The next time I tried I couldn't for the life of me remember how I did it. <br />
Guess I'll keep checking back here hoping somebody knows... :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exsanguination</div><div class="date">Sep 27, 2002, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I figured out how to do it the hard way with PSP. All you have to do is start from a fresh slate (new file). I kept trying to do it all with Bizzy as my first layer. <br />
<br />
The one thing I hate about PSP is that its so very user-friendly that its not very powerful. PS6 has many more capabilities, and is much, much better IMHO. But the Ctrl+T function is just an amzing function (especially when dealing with civ3 pcx's) that I almost always end up resorting to PSP7. I'll see if there is a plug-in. Any ideas where I could look?<br />
<br />
PH - I rather enjoy your sig as well.</div></div><hr />
