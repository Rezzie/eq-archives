So no, it is not OK to open the mail.<br />
But it is also much less worse than philippe's description, search for info about it in trendmicro.com if you wish.</div></div><hr />

It's a virus farm. I use web-based email, and just go directly to the site(s), also, I use Mozilla, which doesn't support ActiveX. Disable any scripting, although, many sites will not work, w/o Java enabled :-(</div></div><hr />

Argh, never know if they are realy or fake. You can normally tell if an email is real or fake by reading the title. :) Use Web based email and you pretty much have nothing to worry about. With hotmail.com you can set it up to only accept from email addresses that you enter in - That makes it really safe.</div></div><hr />

I just noticed this thread.... must have missed it earlier somehow.<br />
<br />
My personal solution is to avoid using MS e-mail programs because they have many vulnerabilities to attack, and MS is always one or two steps behind hackers.  MS does usually release a patch once a particular exploit causes enough damage or gets enough adverse publicity.... but the user must constantly check and update.<br />
<br />
With any e-mail program, you do not want to open an attachment unless you are sure of the sender.  Never open an unsolicited attachment.  With MS e-mail (e.g., Outloook), it is quite possible to activate a virus by opening the e-mail itself, but the virus of course must be designed to do this.  Most do not.... every virus is designed to activate, propagate, and cause damage in its own way.<br />
<br />
I use Eudora as my e-mail program, and have since the early 1990's.  It is not immune to viruses, but far less susceptible because many viruses are written specifically to target users of Outlook and Outlook Express.<br />
<br />
The other thing to do of course is to run an anti-virus program, and keep the virus definitions up to date.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Ideally:<br />
1.  Don't use MS Outlook/OE.<br />
2.  Don't open e-mail you're not sure about.<br />
3.  Never open an attachment you're not sure about.<br />
4.  Use an antivirus program.<br />
5.  Make sure you scan any incoming attachment for viruses.<br />
<br />

I have 2 emails for spam (yahoo has a great spam filter) and 2 for private use.<br />
<br />
Screw outlook.</div></div><hr />

I use totalise, they have a web based interface AND the ability to use it with e-mail programs AND 50MB (!!!) storage space.<br />
<br />
And I trust them for reliability since they are an ISP, they only setback is the co.uk ending.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean Lindstrom</div><div class="date">Jul 28, 2002, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The unexpected e-mails from people you know can contain virus (sent without their knowing). A virus e-mail may have a likely subject like &quot;important!&quot;, or &quot;I love you&quot;, and it's a shame to delete these! Encourage your friends to write unique, specific subject headings, perhaps including a signature character like &quot;+&quot; to make it clear they wrote it.</div></div><hr />
