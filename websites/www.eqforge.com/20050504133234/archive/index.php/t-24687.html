If you met a land unit or a naval unit on or near your continent (and its islands) then they found you.<br />

Use this thread to post any great details about the events surrounding your gaining contact with the other Civs during GOTM-8.<br />

The next turn I made contact with them and I was lucky to keep my galley.  I then return to my own coast after trading my Theology for World Map and other contacts.<br />
I did not tell them about France,  the only civ left on my continent.</div></div><hr />

The very first one &quot;made it&quot; to near the Japanese coastline, made contact and promptly sunk.  But who cares? Job done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But found that people in the other continent WAY behind in tech and economy. No one other than China would pay anything per turn for my outdated tech, so I played as the great isolator. Keeping those communications myself until I have discovered Magnetism and sold it to Joan.</div></div><hr />

Then i traded among the other continent for the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 14, 2002, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since we are half way through the month and I am the only one to post that they made contact via China, I should explain how that happened.<br />
<br />
I reality this should almost have been a contact via Japan because of where the contact occurred.<br />
<br />
When I got the GreatLight, it was near the end of a period of war with England and I had three galleys that had been invloved in exploration and helping to terminate Libby. As I got within two turns of the Great Light, I had the Galleys drop their other tasks along the former English coast and start probing outward to the West. Didn't attempt any suicide missions yet but I was looking for hint of coast or sea bridge.<br />
<br />
One Galley was up by an area that seemed to promise a sea rout and when the Great light popped, I struck out in that direct. Turned out to be a tube of sea that eventually seemed to end, but It had taken two turns to follow it that far out so there had to be something more.<br />
<br />
Cautiously stepped one tile out to the northeast and saw no sea on the other side. Time to chance it or turn back but the greatlight gives me four moves and I still have 3 left. I had the second galley just 3 tiles back so I went for it and moved forward 1 more tile, still no promise of a safe sea zone. If I go forward and can glimpse a sea tile then I can move to it, if no sea I'm in deep kaka.<br />
<br />
<br />
1 more move and a sea tile is just in reach to the north of my position and with my last move I claim it and a mountainous coast pops into view. I can only see the mountain with gems on it and a chinese worker madly mining away.<br />
<br />
I could see the border edge with another civ so I had contact with them the next turn and started my rounds of advantageous trading.<br />
<br />
By all basic map layout rules, the Chinese settler should have been Japanese but apparently the Chinese and Indians had succeeded running a few settlers up on this point before Japan could fully settle most of its territory.<br />
<br />
I would be interested to know if the people that made first contact with Japan did it across this same point only it had been settled by the Japanese in their game.<br />
<br />
I immediately turned my galleys around and headed back to the homeland to load up with settlers to probe for gaps while I could use ROPs that were essentially one way since the other civs could not cross the oceans yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fossil</div><div class="date">Jun 15, 2002, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my game the Japanese got the lighthouse. As soon as I lost that race, I cranked up research to get navigation.  <br />
<br />
Since the Lighthouse was built pretty late, sometime after 600 AD, it did not take all that long to get to navigation - this was still in the 700's.  Then my galleys took off.<br />
<br />
Not having this wonder, I was a bit surprised that I found them before they found me.<br />
<br />
The Japanese had the gems, and had captured the chokepoint.  With three luxuries that I didn't have, they became my first target on that continent.<br />
<br />
They died in 1590, defending their cities mostly with spearmen vs. my cavalry.  :crazyeye:</div></div><hr />

This type of poll will be a good summary overview for those players who do not want to wade through the whole sequence of the Spoiler threads and otehr topic discussions just to get a little picture of how their game may have compare to the play sequences of others.</div></div><hr />
