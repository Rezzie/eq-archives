You can answer this poll question even before you complete the entire game if you can reasonably be certain of the answer that applies to you.</div></div><hr />

I made getting the GL priority one - but didn't get it as soon as planned. I describe this on my site: Fossil's Dig Site (http://www.angelfire.com/retro/fossil)</div></div><hr />

Contact and Maps of other CIVS was traded for and as Japan is in first place it is they who I will concentrate on (so no ocean travel needed).<br />

I can't tell for sure, but did you choose one of the options in the poll?<br />
<br />
I so, I think you may have answered with the wrong choice and that will screw up the data. I think you may have chosen the option where you indicated you built the GreatLight between 300 and 100BC when you actual should have waited and chosen one of the two options where another CIV beat you to the GreatLight. Either you will win or you will loose, only time will tell.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you emphasized the Pyramids as important on the snaky home continent and that is not a choice I would have made because I find the Pyramids to be a great captured benefit in many games.<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can get a moderator to fix your poll response if it turns out to be mischosen.<br />

Thanks for participating in these focused one topic summary polls.</div></div><hr />

You could be right in the long run re: Great Lighthouse. but I found at the beginning when trying to expand as quickly as possible in the home island the pyramids help to get those settlers out. To be honest I did not expect to get it and was using it a pre-build. I have never won a race to this wonder as the AI sees it as a priority. Another side effect was it triggered my golden age far too early!!</div></div><hr />

This was a great thing in my game, I have had knowledge at 0% since the discovery of literacy, with the exception of the race for military tradition, and I have 2-3k in the bank at all times thanks to this.  I'm sure I would have been beat to the GL if I hadn't had my GA.  I have been able to use this money for my rabid expaninist wars, currently against both germany and pesia.  My first ever purposful two front war.  And all this because I didn't prioritize the Great Lighthouse!</div></div><hr />

I find the example of the Persian's building the great wall in 280AD to be a classic example of pre-programmed AI stupidity. They had to have their continent virtually full by that point and the threat from barbarians was really minimal in this game. The great wall wonder came at the expense of setting aside resources for something like the Great Library (denial stratgy) or Sun Tzus or Sistine.<br />
<br />
I am with you that a pre-1000BC light may have been of little value that early because I was really rushing galleys and pushing them out to the far reaches of the world and I still had not run out of coastal explore space by 500 to 400 BC.<br />
<br />
I had built enough galleys for at least one or two leaps of faith if they were needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cracker the Great Wall doubles city defense.  So it's not that stupid to have it for a militaristic civ like persia.  In my game they were constantly trying to take over more territory via war.  So they wanted to be able to defend there cities easier.  In my game they built Sun Tzus though, and germany got the great wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 03:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Skaternate,<br />
<br />
Persia is Industrious/Scientific (not militaristic). Walls cost 16 shields for them and also increase defensive values. The terrain on Persia's continent was narrow and confining where they met Montezuma and that would have let them get the benefit of the Great Wall for only 32 to 48 shields and careful city placement.<br />
<br />
Also the Great Wall is obsoleted by Metallurgy (cannons). Since Persia is scientific they can reach metallurgy in as little as 20 turns from around 280 AD and this will negate any defensive bonus from the Great Wall. None of Persia's neighbors had a UU strength that would have made the GW necessary. (perhaps the exception of Japan but we could be sure CB had Japan isolated by the Great Light gambit + geography.)<br />
<br />
If Persia had been militaristic then the cost of walls would have been 8 shields and it would have taken almost 20 cities for them to break even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cartouche Bee</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to add to this AI building Great Wall discussion.<br />
<br />
Persia being Industrious does match up to Great Wall because it is a Militaristic and Industrious type wonder. But unless the documentation is incorrect the Great Wall doubles the effects of walls built in cities. Now that is great, but I did not see any evidence that they built any walls anyway. Now, I'm pretty sure they did not have a Golden Age by the time they built the Great Wall, cause they started their war with the Aztecs later, so it would have satisfied an appropriate type wonder to trigger a peaceful Golden Age; so I suppose it may have been justified but didn't work out to their benefit.<br />

I don't bother reading the documentation I get my info from the editor.  IE screenshot of great wall.  You will notice the flag just says double city defense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reference in the manual is on Page 101 and it says&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;doubles the defense bonus for all your walls&quot;<br />
<br />
I quess this shows how little we really may know about the game.<br />
<br />
In the editor there is only one improvement or wonder that shows giving a defensive bonus to the city in which it is located and that is walls.<br />
<br />
As a basis for gaining acces to a Golden Age, that gives more potential value to the choice of building the great wall, but still this does not seem to be a really valuable wonder relative to the other choices that should have been available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">True.  But now I take a guess at the Great Walls true effect.  I would hypothisis since the editor says double defense of cities and manual says doubles effect of walls, that possible since a level 7+ can't have walls anymore that ounce a city is that large then it just doubles the city defense value.  So a small city has to have walls for it to work, and a big city just has to be big for it to work.  Or something like that at least.</div></div><hr />

I guess the real bonus was the +1 movement for my gallies so they reached Persia/Aztecs in time to sell them polytheism for lots of cash and getting the entire upper half of the ancient tech tree for free from my Great library just as my citizens started screaming for aquaducts.

I am not used to playing on Islands I totally forgot how useful the wonder would be until a bit later in the game.  I ended up switching my FP to the lighthouse (got lucky that I was building it in a coastal city), and built my FP ne city over.  No leaders yet, No war yet, just expasion, expansion, expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not finished yet (might not have time to finish), but I'm comfortable with my position (1100 AD, finishing off the Japanese, mid-Medieval Techs and only 1 tech behind - banking).<br />
<br />
The GL would have been useful, but not critical.  What I'm missing is trade capability with the rest of the world, and I need navigation (currently researching) or magnetism to achieve that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Colossus followed in 710 BC, the same year we discovered Japan. They built the Oracle in 670 BC. :(<br />
<br />
Egypt finished the Great Lighthouse in 450 BC and the Great Library in 150 BC. Of course after discovering The Republic in 250 BC our science rate had already been set to zero. :)<br />
<br />
Finally we completed the Great Wall in 150 AD, before we entered the next age on the following turn.</div></div><hr />

There was plenty of room for colonies on the islands to the north and in Japan to the east, which were already accessible to Egyptian galleys. In order to discover exotic Civs, &quot;intrepid galleys&quot; are generally much less expensive than the Lighthouse. (Not that the Queen wouldn't have enjoyed the extra culture!)<br />
