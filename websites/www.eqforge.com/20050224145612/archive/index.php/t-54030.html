<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 22, 2003, 07:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are not too many things to consider in a poll now since only a few turns have been played since the last poll. The things that were decided last time that do not need changes:<br />
<br />
(1) The Doughnutia caravan will be used for domestic trading and not sent abroad<br />
(2) Mike will be built in Neumatic<br />
(3) The terrain will be improved according to previous plans<br />
<br />
However, I'm including again the option of switching to crusader in FW. The reasons are that we now have (or will very soon have) enough caravans to complete Mike so a caravan from FW isn't necessary. More importantly our defenses in the east are alarmingly weak; had the Barbarians appeared near Igloria instead of BS we'd have been in serious trouble; they might have razed Igloria. I strongly recommend building crusaders in FW immediately. Also the Greeks are nearby.<br />
<br />
I'm including the option to build trireme in RF because we really need it to have some means of transporting stuff between our main continent and the continent to the west. The trireme north of LP will have that role near LP/Igloria for cities on the Aztec continent and the trireme near the Greeks is too far away at the moment.<br />
<br />
BS is adequately defended after we bribed a barbarian archer so would should switch from building phalanx to something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 22, 2003, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a) Sorry, but with over 40 s already in the pot, I'd finish the van in FW first (this can be done in 1 turn by reassigning a worker to forest for a turn), then build the crusader next.  It's a gamble, but one I would take.  <br />
<br />
In the unlikely event of a landing in that area, we can use the nearby warriors and dip to slow the invaders long enough to assemble the necessary power to counter.  Yes it puts a city like igloria at risk for a few more turns, but I wouldn't overreact.  This is the AI we're talking about here. ;) <br />
<br />
B)  Igloria can't very well handle support for another settler, especially with republic and 2f support on the horizon.  Also note: With the warrior out of the city you can put elvis to work.<br />
<br />
C)  With MC coming soon, I wouldn't make any rash moves to secure the city.  It will stablize with the chapel, then growth should be able to resume right away.<br />
<br />
D)  Since I have Igloria building a trireme, I'll vote against that here.<br />
<br />
E) we can use another settler in the west.  My second choice here would be caravan.<br />
<br />
F) No sense rushing a revolution, especially with mikes so close.  When we do revolt, there should be a fairly thorough examination of shield and food support.  We don't want to lose any settlers.  We'll probably want to get rid of several warriors once martial law is no longer effective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with Tim that we should finish the FW caravan. First of all, we don't want to waste the shields. Second, we do have a dip nearby and with the road almost complete in a few turns, we can restation the elephant for a while. Third, if we build a caravan in FW we'll be able to finish MC in Neumatic the same turn as we enter republic next oedo year. Otherwise we'll have to wait another four turns to switch.<br />
<br />
Still, we need more protection in the area, but I suggest we switch to a crusader in another city, either VM (ready in 6 without help, or 4 if we sack three trades) or Nae.<br />
<br />
I do think Igl should build a settler, because it'll be used immediately to found C5 or C6 with another settler. The one on the end of the the Aztec continent could be found in 5 turns.<br />
<br />
All of these options seem to be losing though...:(</div></div><hr />

One reason not to build a settler in Igloria is to get it to size 3 ASAP so it can be celebrated to size 8 once we become a republic (although this could also be done by adding settler(s) to Igloria...). If Igloria doesn't build a settler and we want to demand tribute before republic one of the nearby settlers should immediately go to Igloria so C5 can be founded ASAP.<br />
<br />
I mostly agree with Tim on this trireme/settler issue.<br />
<br />
It seems to me C5 can be founded on the turn we probably become a republic so on that turn we could demand tribute from the Aztecs and Zulus by first continuing in monarchy and then switching to republic on that same turn. Seems to me like this tribute issue is the foreign advisor's responsibility (I'd love to get tons of cash for the upcoming WLTP).<br />
<br />
Regarding crusader vs. caravan in FW it seemed to me that not building caravan in FW would not delay Mike but I can't recheck this now because I'm at work :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 23, 2003, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3 on their way to Neu from West, 2 in Neu, 1 being built in Neu and 1 on its way from North. One is also in Nae, but each turn we wait for it is another turn we'll have to wait for MC.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 23, 2003, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 7 caravans that will all have reached Neu in 440 AD when there will be a revolution so we need one more. I've found a solution to this problem that looks like a nice compromise. FW builds a caravan (it will reach Neumatic in time) and Neumatic immediately switches to crusader that will be completed 2 turns from now, sent to FW and probably rehomed there and voila: Enough caravans and my beloved crusader are all there :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your plan sounds good.:)</div></div><hr />
