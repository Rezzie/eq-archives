The Viking: you won both elections for Domestic and Military advisors. As you can only hold one main Government position, you need to choose which one you want to do most, and you can hold the deputy position for the other post. The runner up for that election will then hold the post.<br />
<br />
So, if you want to be Domestic advisor, naervod will be your deputy and Blissful Zen will become Military Advisor and you'll also be his deputy - and vice versa.<br />
<br />
Please post your decision here. <br />
<br />
Well done to all elected officials!! :D</div></div><hr />

I haven't really noticed which weekdays Jayne has been playing, but are Wednesdays and Weekends (Saturday or maybe Sunday) allright?<br />
<br />
I'm off school every wednesday and unless we have a lot of schoolwork I will have plenty of time then, and I'd prefer Saturdays because I usually plan to do schoolwork on Sundays.:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks to everyone who voted for me :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
As long as the turns are reliably done twice a week or so, plan whatever days work for you best.  A Wednesday/Saturday schedule looks good to me.  If you are ever not able to play a scheduled turn, contact the Vice-President and see if they are available to play.  If they cannot play, contact me and I can play the round.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for playing, I will be able to play pretty much any day of the week, but will be gone for the whole day on the 16th and 17th and two days on Memorial Day weekend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Apr 30, 2003, 01:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a general rule, yes, but since the Civ 2 game doesn't use a chat session where you can see who is avaiable to play at that momnet, we can't expect the President to PM each person in the CoC and wait for a response.  My post above it meant as more of an impromptu 'something came up all the sudden' proceedure.</div></div><hr />

~CivGeneral By all means, and you can start right now :D  I will be away from a computer until probably Monday, so could you handle any polls/discussions that will need to happen before then?<br />
<br />
thanks a bunch.</div></div><hr />
