<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have 18 size 3+ cities and well over half of these can grow if we continue celebrating. However, food shortage will soon prevent them from continuing to grow so we should celebrate for a maximum of two more turns. This is option A2 - there the decision whether to celebrate one or two turns would be made by the president depending on the situation one turn from now.<br />
<br />
When we stop celebrating luxuries are lowered to 20% (a lower value results in civil disorder).<br />
<br />
There is also a lot of things we want to accomplish, science discoveries to be made, we need many new engineers, barracks and military units to start peacekeeping operations in Hell, libraries in the big cities, more banks, supermarkets when we discover refrigeration etc.<br />
<br />
There are some important techs we will soon discover. From the science ministry's recommended tech path we still need the following (in this order):<br />
<br />
Leadership, Electricity, Conscription, Tactics, Refrigeration<br />
<br />
Refrigeration is extremely useful to make our cities grow and we have lots of cash so the Ministry of Domestic Affairs is recommending setting science=80% and taxes=0% until we have discovered all of these techs and probably steam engine as well. This enables us to make roughly one discovery per turn. We can afford to run a tax deficit for almost 20 turns if we do not buy anything, we have $1522 and an upcoming caravan delivery.<br />
<br />
The different options result in the following amounts of $$ and discoveries:<br />
<br />
B1: $1144/77, 6 turns<br />
B2: $499/77, 2 turns<br />
B3: $0/77, 1 turn<br />
<br />
Once this is accomplished we'd collect cash by setting taxes to 70-80% for a few turns. This yields more than $1000 per turn.<br />
<br />
Build queue polls will be posted tomorrow. It should be noted that the 'contents' of the build queues will not be affected by the results of this poll; only the speed with which they can be implemented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedBull</div><div class="date">Jul 05, 2003, 12:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Were it up to me, I say we follow the recommended path, rushing to get to Machine Tools, and then proceed to get rid of the Zulus first and foremost after we replenish our funds.  All we need toward the end of this game is a primitive wamonger civ to throw kinks in our plans when we need to be our most precise.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot the rest...<br />
<br />
After we get a substantial force over to the Zulus, we could use the first couple cities of thiers we conquer to finish production to end that war, allowing us to focus &quot;our own cities&quot; on the suggested domestic advances.  It's just a matter of rushing the tech, getting cash, and rush building a few units.<br />
<br />
As for the Greeks, I'd have a mind to simply try to hold them off until we get a chance to sign a treaty with them.  Too big of a civ to really put a dent in with the domestic issues at hand.</div></div><hr />

The additional science from the libraries should offset the lower science rate in a few turns.</div></div><hr />
