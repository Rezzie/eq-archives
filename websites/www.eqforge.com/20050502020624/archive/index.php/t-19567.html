<br />
I have a strange problem playing GOTM VI, which I have not had when playing &quot;normal&quot; games. I did install the 1.17 patch (and not the 1.16 since I bought the game recently) and more or less everything has been working OK.<br />
<br />
Initially I opted for the Great Library as a wonder, and I finally got it, then I tried to build the Great Lighthouse, but was beaten to it within 15 turns. The City Governor suggested I change the production (in the city in question) from the Great Lighthouse to Marketplace (which was fine, it was an improvement I needed - and I was fair and square beaten to it by another CIV). <br />
<br />
Later I tried to build the Hanging Gardens (I was late into Monarchy, but it was just some 10-15 turns away, so I decided to go for it - I though I could switch to Smiths Trading if I was beaten to it, since I was going for Economics at the time). When I was 10 turns away from the Hanging Gardens another civ built it - and I waited for the Governor to suggest a change in production - BUT NOTHING HAPPENED. Also I could start building other GW already completed by other civs.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't really know what happened here. I know this was a problem when I first played the game (without 1.16 or 1.17 patch), but I though they fixed this in the 1.16 patch.<br />
<br />
I don't think I can finish this GOTM since it is clearly something strange going on here, and a reload is not to think about (i'm all fair and square....) :)<br />
<br />
Any ideas what can have happened??</div></div><hr />

Don't listen to the governer.  If you are not building the wonder in your capitol city, then switch the production to a palace, if you won't build it before said knowledge is learned.  You can then continue building it until a wonder comes around.  If it is in your capitol then build whatever costs the most shields to save yourself time in the long run.</div></div><hr />

You can then continue building it until a wonder comes around. If it is in your capitol then build whatever costs the most shields to save yourself time in the long run.  Yeah, that I've learned - so that's my strategy for most of my &quot;must have wonders&quot;, to start pre-production on something costly, and then switch to the Wonder in time for a fast completion. Referring to the &quot;Hanging Gardens&quot; problem, I wanted to switch to Smiths Trading (and was merely waiting for my Governors expectedly silly suggestion), but the City kept on working on the Hanging Gardens for a few turns before I quit the game. I closed it before I would have been finished with the Hanging Gardens (although I should not be allowed to) - since it was rather late in the night :)<br />
<br />
So, I don't know what happened to the game, but I will open it again tonight, and see if it keeps on going with multiple GW or if it is something important I've missed. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kipner</div><div class="date">Apr 05, 2002, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well,<br />
<br />
I actually re-opened my game and continued to build the Hanging Gardens - Persia finished the HG 6 turns before me, I was allowed to continue and also finished the HG (complete with the wonder splash screen). I know that someone else (a civ I hadn't made contact with yet) also made the HG - which means that there are essentially 3 Hanging Gardens in my world now.<br />
<br />
So, I'm closing this GOTM now, a pity since even if I wouldn't be top 20 (or even top 30) it would have been nice to compare yourself to the magicians on this site. I'll have to wait for the May game (which no doubt will be a Deity game in which I will be killed in 3950 BC or something..... :(<br />
<br />
Now, a question. Was this an issue pre v 1.16 patch? (That you could complete a wonder even if you were beaten to it). My memory is weak since I only played a couple of games before loading patch 1.17. I went straight into patch 1.17 since I bought the game late.<br />
<br />
I may have to re-install my game and the 1.17 patch to see if it is solved. Irritating though since my random games have always worked according to plan regarding the wonders.<br />

<br />
To my excuse, I played the game late at night, and did not really pay attention to what happened (get to the point).<br />
<br />
Well, I have never been aware of the fact that the Cultural Advisor give you an indication when another (known) civ is beginning the construction of a wonder - &quot;Persia is building the Hanging Gardens&quot;.... In my dazed confusion I thought this was &quot;crap! I lost this wonder race - how come??!!&quot;. <br />
<br />
Of course it was just the indication of commencing the construction. <br />
<br />
So, thanks anyone for spending time on figuring this out (even if you didn't post), and I'll make sure that I wear my silly hat for a few days, and carefully check things before I post such thing as a &quot;problem&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have continued my game now, and even if I'm going to be far down the ladder, I'll submit my game when I'm finished.<br />
