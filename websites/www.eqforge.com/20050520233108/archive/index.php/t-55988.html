Sad to see you go, again.<br />
Good Luck with whatever it is you're doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
also- what happened?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please reconsider, as you are still a valuable part of the game.  I mean, you should of course take the needed time to mourn your loss.  <br />
<br />
Please take some time and think about it.  In the meantime, I will find someone for your Term 2 positions.  :)<br />
<br />
Also, since I didn't get a chance to do so in the other thread, I would like to extend to you my deepest sympathies.  <br />
<br />
DZ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Immortal</div><div class="date">Jun 15, 2003, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey jen, you know youve always got a nice place over there. <br />
<br />
We would love some stories about your cousin too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bootstoots</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CT, simply because TF selected DZ over you to mod this forum doesn't mean that he's rejected you.  He probably wanted someone new to become a moderator.  We all support you here, you're a great player in our demogame.  Please stay here, we support you.  We certainly understand that you need time off while mourning your cousin and while beta testing, but I really want you to stay in the game.  You are one of the best people I could have imagined to mod the demogame, I'm sure it was a tough decision for TF.  <br />
<br />
BTW, if I were TF, I'd have picked you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ur leaving the demogame? :cry: <br />
<br />
This isnt good. U and Shaitan are the greatest people in the whole dg. I am sure most demogamers would agree wo that..<br />
<br />
my deepest condoloances for what hapend to ur cousin :(<br />
<br />
I hope u come back some time...<br />
<br />
The DG will miss u..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 03:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK, this new development makes my previous post look entirely underhanded, which is truly not the case.<br />
<br />
I was only guessing what CT's reason for leaving was and until 5 minutes ago(upon reading Thunderfall's PM) had no idea that I was even in the running for the moderator position! :eek:<br />
<br />
Not that I am not honored to be considered for this position, but could someone have even told me?  I just show up today to find that I am the new mod, not to mention the guy that drove away Chieftess.<br />
<br />
All of this during my embattled presidency to boot.  This should prove to be interesting.  I am honestly as surprised as you are, CT.</div></div><hr />

TF just added several new forums to your responsibilities.  I really wish you would stay.  :cry:</div></div><hr />

I would have thought you would at least been informed of the option in advance so you could at least decline if you so desired.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the past, TF usually will not act on a decision until a couple days after he announces it.  Anyway, I thought Shaitan had talked to DZ about this, since he made the original recommendation.  I am a bit surprised myself at how quickly this moved along...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Immortal</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 05:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hey, Im not pointing the blame at anyone, all Im saying is that we've experienced a communication breakdown</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">WTG, DZ. I sure you'll make a great Mod.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Strider</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2003, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CT, Don't quit... Please :).<br />
<br />
Also, Just because DZ got the op poistion and not you doesn't mean anything. Well, atleast to me it doesn't...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2003, 12:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CT, please dont go :(.<br />
<br />
Remember what you told me not to quit after I lost the election.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cannon</div><div class="date">Jun 17, 2003, 01:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">sorry... :splat:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2003, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ct:<br />
hmmm. im sorry to see you go, but i think the reason you stated is not a good one... i would be disappointed of you if that was the real and only reason...<br />
<br />
anyways, i will delete you from the op position in the #demogame room and will deown you from the room, too... sorry ct, if you come back i will be glad to give back the position to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gingerbread Man</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2003, 03:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, at least you haven't left CFC all together. You were great in DG II, and you're the best player in the MSDG.<br />
<br />
Will you be lurking in these forums, just not Modding? or have you left this totally?<br />
<br />
I'm leaving the SP demogame. Goodbye.<br />
Oh, OK. Well, thanks for all the help you gave to newbies, when I was one. I remember the first Turn Chat I went to, and you were very helpful.</div></div><hr />
