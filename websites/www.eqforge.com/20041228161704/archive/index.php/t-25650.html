I just wanted to say TRY OPERA! www.opera.com  <br />
At least try a browser other than IE. :D</div></div><hr />

-Now you can configure how Opera handles the multi windows. (All windows inside Opera or different windows on the taskbar).<br />
<br />
- With the release of Mozilla and Mozilla based Netscape, the web pages will be more standart coded. There are really few ones left that only works with IE. I don't remember when was the last time I identified as IE. And things will go better.</div></div><hr />

Each has their advantages and disadvantages, but unfortunately most websites have been made for IE today. :o<br />

:D You won't believe but; sometimes people come and ask about &quot;opera&quot; to opera.general news group. :) What can I say? :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2002, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have opera and still have it installed on my computer.  I love the program, but there are a few things I don't like about it.  The biggest one I don't like si that it won't display anything on the screen untill it has downloaded everything (or almost everything) from the web server.  So if you get your connection dropped or queued you may have to wait an extra 20 or 30 seconds before you can see the page.  What happens more often is that you can't get a response from the server responsible for the banner ads, in which case you have to wait untill Opera decides no give up on that connection.  <br />
<br />
Opera = good program, few glitches, still outclassed by IE.<br />
<br />
Who did you play in Turandot, IceBlaze?  Calaf?  Liu?  Timur? Ping?  Pang?  Pong? or Turandot herself?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KaeptnOvi</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2002, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use it quite often, especially on sites that spawn lots of pop-ups, nobody handles them as easily as opera.</div></div><hr />

Once in Firenze, and once in Israel (Keysaria). Both were good.</div></div><hr />

You have just made the case for dismantling MS into many, separate companies and about 400 to 600 billion dollars in reparations to the literally hundreds of companies that MS has forced out of existance by exrecising their illegal monopoly power.<br />

Kind of contradictory with your other post, no?<br />

I've been in Turandot (twice)...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wouldn't it be better Civ3 to have an &quot;ad bannered?&quot; free version? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gonzo_for_civ</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I use an incredibly stripped down version of IE, it runs fast and lacks a lot of security flaws. I used IE 3.0 for a LOONNNGGG time. Very fast program.<br />
<br />
I have tried Opera before and it's still on my comp but I don't have a need for it because IE works fine for me.<br />

Edit: 2nd paragraph</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TedG</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I used Netscape for a while, until I started using IE instead. IE works well with Windows because of MS's monopolistic (sp?) integration of IE and Windows. It's fast enough for me anyway, and rarely crashes. When I used Netscape, it was slower and crashed more than IE. But that was a while ago - maybe they've since improved it. I haven't tried Opera or any of those other browsers because IE has been working fine for me and I don't want banner ads if at all possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chiefpaco</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like Opera.  Seems to crash the odd time, perhaps less than IE did on my PC but at least it does not take windows down with it.  IE almost always did that on my PC here.</div></div><hr />
