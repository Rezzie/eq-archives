If you let them capture a city and let them keep it, would you be able to destroy all the remaining civilisations and thus ensure that you get your 3 points per turn guaranteed for keeping peace, when you are amassing points scoring.<br />
<br />
To stop the Barbarians wandering you just surround the city with a few tanks.</div></div><hr />

No, that's not possible. Once you have killed all other Civilizations, the game is over.</div></div><hr />

Actually, not to say your wrong but it will sometimes ask you if you want to continue playing even though everyone is dead/go to AC/reach 2020AD and your score won't count.<br />

I've done it anyway but it's boring. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/cwm33.gif<br />

I read what has been said above, BUT is it proven?<br />

<br />
If in 1800(any year will do) you did this and you wiped out all other Civ's would the game end.<br />

I wanted to do the same thing but unfortunately the game just ended. Speaking of Barbarian cities, I was just going through my city.txt for spell check and remembered at the bottom that they have their own list. Can the Barbarians build cities? What if I purposely setup a city to be taken that is producing settlers, will they then produce settlers? I remeber a patch that allowed play of hotseat multiplayer on classic civ2 and you could be the Barbarians but when you took over a city you couldn't change what the city was producing or the game would crash. Does anyone still have a copy of this patch/hack?<br />

<br />
No, they spend all their shield on building military units. I think the names are used when a Barbarian unit stumbles upon one of your undefended units. Then it says something like:<br />
<br />
Barbarian leader Atilla of the Huns: &quot;Give us 50 gold or we we mercilessly crush Townsville&quot;<br />
<br />
Reminds me of another question: does the AI ever do anything with those barbarian diplomats?<br />

They do not appear to make any diplomat type missions, nor do the barbs have a treasury to pay for any missions.</div></div><hr />

I then used it to bribe barb military units. (Multiple shiploads kept landing to harrass an isolated city with moderate defenses that couldn't kill them all, so I bribed a bunch and then built a city where they were landing to stop them.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
No point qoting them all.<br />
<br />
The game is over when all the the civs are dead, even if the barbs are in the game.<br />
<br />
There is no point playing after the game has ended, because there is no score, and that SUCKS!!!<br />
<br />
Yes the barbarian dimplomats are the guys with the horned helmets.<br />
<br />
If you want to continue the game... instead of leaving a barbarian city, why can't you just leave one opposition city? That would do just the same thing that you are querying, no?<br />

I'm pretty sure that there is no extra score for all the Civs you have vanquished before launching the space ship - At least I have never experienced that.<br />
