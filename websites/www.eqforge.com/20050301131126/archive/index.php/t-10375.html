I have learned a lot about this game from the different strategies that have been posted. I also have had a lot of questions that were answered right to the point and easier to understand than the manual.<br />
I hope all the discussions don't stop and all the egos stay away cause I think that this is a good site for all beginners to come to.<br />
<br />
I would also like to know if there is other sites for other different games to get good advice from as well and if there is a general cite with multiple games. If anyone can come up with a good one for STRONGHOLD would be cool with me.<br />
<br />
Just thought I would express myself and sorry to stray you from the game stuff.:goodjob: :scan: :rotfl: :beer: Canadiangloworm excepts help from anyone!!!!!!</div></div><hr />
