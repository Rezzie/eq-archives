Ive GTA:III and GTA:VC and Im waiting for San Andreas to come out, tho that looks to be a long time for the PC.  <br />
Somtimes I just like to cruise, no real missions to do, thats the thing that attracts me to GTA, the open-endedness of it.<br />
So what do you want to see implemented in SA? <br />
<br />
Uh yeah bbasically some random questions, I just want to get a disccusiion about GTA going.  :mischief:</div></div><hr />

That toy helicopter mission in vice city was probably the hardest for me :) (I have the pc version)</div></div><hr />

I like the atmosphere of 3 better myself, grimy real, true to life stuff. VC was a good game but there wasnt a whole lot of.. hey Im doing somthing wrong here apeal to it ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smash</div><div class="date">Jul 22, 2004, 01:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kinda like the Italian mob thing of 3,but overall,VC was better.<br />
<br />
The helicopters are great.You get a plane that actually has wings!<br />
Motorcycles!...luv cruzin on a hog.<br />
<br />
Did I mention boats?...this was much cooler than 3.<br />
<br />
Vice City is Al Pacino's Scarface.Of course everyone found the Scarface apartment?<br />
<br />
How bout the chocolate easter egg?<br />
<br />
My all time fav Mission is/was Phom Phen or whatever.The one where you ride gunner on a helo in VC.Honorable mention to the Bank Job(also VC-The Driver is the toughest mission in all GTA games..so far).I also luved the import/export garage in 3.<br />
<br />
And yes I did get get 100% on 3 and 200% on VC.Finding thoses packages was a challenge and a half!<br />
<br />
San Andreas sounds really cool.Looks like you start out as a sorta street gang member and go from there.Can't wait!<br />
<br />
The thing I really like about the last 2 GTAs are the freedom you have and that missions can be completed in different ways</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BCLG100</div><div class="date">Jul 22, 2004, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i havnt played played GTA vice city ive played GTA 3 though and i found that little remote controll thing so frikkin boring it was beyond belief.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spycatcher34</div><div class="date">Jul 22, 2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow hey smash :)<br />
<br />
Now while Ill give VC its props for the scarface stuff (yeah the apartment was a nice easter egg, thats what I love about Rock* they have the best sense of humour and hidden stuff), I liked the mafia in 3 better. But VC was funnier IMO, and I think thats the point most people miss when they get angry about this game. It's not meant to be take seriously, its a paradoy of itself.<br />
Motorcycles, I LOVE 'em! Seriously w/o them VC would have sucked as far as unique jumps go. That in itself gives the game more replay value over 3.<br />
Ting into how you said missions could be completed in differnt ways, my favourite mission from GTA3 is sayanora salvatore where you must hit him before he gets into his garage. The first few times I tried the mission I'd get blown to peieces by his goons. Then I discovered tha roof across the street...perfect sniper postion. Ive also tried it where you block his garage door with cars and then blwn him up when he arrives back at the mansion... so many ways to do the mission.<br />
One thing that is annoying about the GTA games that really isnt fixible is how you cant replay a misson without starting a new game.<br />
I've been lookingon some SA fansties, and it looks like the game will be HUGE. <br />
I'll sum it up for those of you who dont know yet. San Andreas is a state(California) an there are three main cities. Los Santos (Los Angeles) will apparently have a large 'ghetto area'  which will fit into the whole 'gang theme' -Im not too sure about that but what can you do? The city that is a mock of San Fransico is San Fierro, from some of teh game artwork Ive seen theres a cable car and hills in that town. The other city is Las Venturas (Las Vegas) you'll be able to build and control your own casino here reports say. Each of these cities should be roughly teh size of VC, but also between the cities there will be countryside. With smaller towns, a gas station where a mission will be featured,a desert, and a big mountain. All in all this game looks to be gigantic in scale.<br />
<br />
@BC the RC missions are SO hard for me, it took me a long time to pass the helicopter one in VC, i dont like them and thats one thing I wouldnt mind not making an apperance in SA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfe Tone</div><div class="date">Jul 23, 2004, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been replaying VC at the moment. I have the PS2 version and I've borrowed my friend's PC version. I'm not sure which one I like better. The PC version is cool in the fact you can aim any gun, but the lack of auto aiming can make some missions harder than the PS2 version. I also like being able to use my own MP3s as a radio station.</div></div><hr />

I agree with the Banshee being the best in 3 but the Banshee in VC is still a pretty cool car. My favourite in VC has to be the Stinger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I asssume there will be more great radio stuff in GTA-SA.As well as more great music.Prolly be some rap in SA.Hope they don't overdue it(I hate rap)<br />
<br />
My fav car is/was the Mafia Sentinel.Not a great performance car but I felt &quot;cool&quot; in one.</div></div><hr />

I also hope they have more on the radio except rap. Lazlow had better be in the game, it's become a tradition.</div></div><hr />
