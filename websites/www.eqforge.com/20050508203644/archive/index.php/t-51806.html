<br />
<br />
we must create a knighthood that will go out to find the parts of this crown. i got a message from the spirit that it shall be called the knights of the octagonal table and there will only be eight knights at all times, one for each side of the knighthood table.<br />
<br />
the spirit said that it will say more to the me of the other knights who join. please say everything you hear about the crown in this thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">Apr 28, 2003, 04:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a good idea with the exception of knights. Change it to warriors for now and &quot;upgrade&quot; to horsemen then knights when appropriate.<br />
<br />
One other thing: Nobody can join anything at the moment as there are no characters yet. Players interested in joining this group will need to generate a character and have that character join. This will be possible by the official start date of the RPG (May 1).</div></div><hr />
