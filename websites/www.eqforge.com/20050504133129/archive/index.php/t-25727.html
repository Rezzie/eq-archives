<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zeke44</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2002, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was my first GOTM game and I thought I was doing ok, but now things don't look good.  I controlled about 40% of the continent, as well as the island off to the North.  Russia and England are gone, India is teeney, China is small, Japan is the third largest power.<br />
<br />
I had the largest industrial base, and was trying for a space race victory when France decided to attack.  They must have had nearly 100 units in a stack marching toward my major city of Leipzig.  My only chance was to use tactical nukes.  It did work and I wiped out at least 80% of the units outright and my panzers picked off the rest.  Unfortunately he responded by nuking two of my cities.  I responded by nuking one of his, and he nuked a third (this was obviously a blunder on my part).  I think I will be able to hold off his army now, but his bombers are doing a number on my improvements.  <br />
<br />
On the plus side, I still control all my cities and have modern armor.  He has three tactical nukes, but has chosen not to use them.  <br />
<br />
Exciting game, but I'm not sure I can survive.<br />

Fired a tacitacal which took out her stack but no damage to the cities themselves. <br />
<br />
I also nuked most of her other cities as I conquered because those mechs were a pain to beat in size 20 cities. They get sooo many defensive bonuses.</div></div><hr />
