<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CanadianGloworm</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The game I'm playing now, I have 24 cities and I just expanded on an island with 2 cities. How come it takes so long to build things there (80 turns for a library, 60 turns for granary).<br />
I haven't looked closely at the shield rate but I do know that its on one of the better production terrains. (if you understand that)<br />
Is it useless to get city inprovements in these cities or what??Why worry when worry kills :goodjob: Still love this game</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">von Brumi</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 11:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that's called corruption. your cities are far from the capital, people pay from pocket to pocket, and you get low prod, low tax, low science. a harbor will help a little, and a courthouse too, but you'll probably have to bear with it.</div></div><hr />

I have a harbor and court house, no change.<br />
should I forget about city improvements and build military or just leave it alone. HELP!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ironfang</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sell the cities for mad cash and technology advances. You will gain ALOT more from the sale than from keeping the cities. always avoid cities on islands.<br />

I guess the next best thing would to trade for resources.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sam_Catchem</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 01:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm..Keep'em if there are some resources on that island.  I like little islands even if there is a lot of corruption.  If you have mad cash go buy all the upgrades/cultural improvement etc.  The corruption will still suck..but it can prove to be advantageous.  I do not know what time in the game it is..but if it is early..those little islands can sure help with new resources.  On more than one occasion My sole source of Oil, Aluminum etc..came from one of these little islands.   If it turns out there is nothing there ever..sell'em.  But not to just one civ..but multiple ones.  Let'em fight over it.  Sell them to rivals!  Let'em duke it out over useless terrain.</div></div><hr />

You need to keep track of how may cities you have for each government.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CanadianGloworm</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 02:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have 24 cities on a Republic.:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One further suggestion to building harbor, temple, and courthouse.  Food is not affected by corruption, so you should be able to grow the city to size six.  Now do what you must to have it celebrate a WLTK day.  Maybe build a marketplace and bank and cathedral.  Make a couple people entertainers.  A continued WLTK day should reduce your corruption a little more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rmsharpe</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, if you're on a very small island, chances are you won't be able to build much until you are able to build offshore platforms...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Endureth</div><div class="date">Nov 28, 2001, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Build the forbiddon palace.  In my experience it doesn't really matter where you build it.  Build it in a place you'll have it quickly.<br />
<br />
The manual says it reduces corruption in nearby cities but in my experience it just seems to raise the number of cities you can have before corruption gets bad.<br />
<br />
Distance does seems to play a minor role but maybe it's just my play style.  In my games I take out one maybe two civs at most and this keeps corruption at a managable level.  It is more than enough to sin the game (unless you like to maim and kill everything in sight).<br />
