<br />
Just wondering if anybody has noticed any trends along these lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Protaxis</div><div class="date">Nov 26, 2001, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, not that I've noticed.<br />
<br />
I just recently began giving other civs techs for money, though, so I'm not sure. Thus far I haven't had anyone declare war on me during those 20 turns, but then again I am the the undisputed king of the world during my present game. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jc011</div><div class="date">Nov 26, 2001, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I have noticed this!! I have already mentioned this before... If there is a civ that is giving you letsay 20 gold per turn and Ivory for 20 turns. If they happen to attack you, you no longer recieve the Ivory and the 20 gold per turn!! This is cheap!! Although you could use this to your advantage! ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say, no.  All per turn deals are off if they attack you.  However, I found this is very rare because it will damage their rep if they renege in this way.  When you or the AI attack while you're the payer in the middle of a &quot;per turn&quot; deal, it affects your rep and other civs will be a lot less likely to deal with you and trade luxuries/gold on per turn basis for fear you'll backstab them.  So the AI doesn't do it much unless it's desparate.<br />
<br />
This is actually a good way to get civs off your back.  If you have a per turn trade going with them they are far less likely to become the aggressors against you.  Of course, if you start hostilities with, say, the Zulus, and they have MPP with your per turn trading partner, the Babylonians, than they automattically go to war with you and the deal is off w/ no damage to Babs rep.  Same w/ military alliance.  The Zulus may pay off the Babs to break agreements w/ you and declare war if you started hostilities.<br />
<br />
But if you're not the aggressor I've found having lots of per turn trades w/ other civs keeps them happy and off your back.  No one has ever initiated a war with me when I had a per turn deal going with them.  And I certainly don't recommend doing it to other civs and backstabbing unless you are completley in control of the game.<br />
