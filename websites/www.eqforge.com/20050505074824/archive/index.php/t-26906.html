<br />
&quot;whenever you pop a goody hut, you cannot get a settler from the hut if you HAVE ANY CITY BUILDING A SETTLER or a settler already roaming around.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is important, because you can temporarily switch cities producing settlers over to something else during the turn where you pop the hut.<br />
<br />
You can also bypass the hut for a turn or two until you get any current settlers founded into cities.<br />
<br />
Getting a free early settler (or two) early in the game will absolutely turn the whole game around, so make sure you take every chance you can to let the game randomly give you a settler.<br />
<br />
Doing these things will not guarantee you a settler, but it will make sure that you have not guaranteed that you cannot get a settler just because you do not know about this hidden code block that was installed by Firaxis.</div></div><hr />

I have heard the rumor but is it documented?  I can swear I got a settler in GOM7 with settlers out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jul 10, 2002, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This was posted on Poly about two weeks ago and I have seen it in discussions there.<br />
<br />
The most recent summary discussion was on July 3rd on Apolytons general forum.<br />
<br />
There was a lot of discussion on goody hut probabilities here on civfanatics in mid June but I have not heard more lately.<br />
<br />
My suspicions where that the resultsfrom goody huts were not a straight probability function and that other hard coded conditions and variables that were not documented could have a significant effect on what you could get out of a goody hut.<br />
<br />
Until things are confirmed it is easy enough to take the precautions to make sure you have a chance at a settler.</div></div><hr />
