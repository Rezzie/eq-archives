<br />
YES! I had the same set up (mine had a 20MB HDD),<br />
And I used to play &quot;Gorillaz&quot; with a friend- and the other one &quot;Nibbles&quot; or &quot;Snakes&quot; or something... like you said- the good old days.<br />
<br />
That was the first computer I owned- the first I used was in my high school- I have no idea as to its specs- but its input was via cards marked with pencil.<br />
<br />
Oh- I forgot- actually the first computer I &quot;used&quot; was built by my eldest brother- a big metal and wood framework cabinent full of vacuum tubes! I'll never forget the smell it made when it got warm!</div></div><hr />

Found out it's a 4.77Mhz 8088, 21MB HD, 320K RAM. I was running Dos 3.0. Much like CMs setup(same processor/ram) but I'll bet I bought mine sooner as there was no deskmate yet(none that I knew of) IIRC. It also had a 5.25 floppy drive. It had a monitor that I don't have anymore and a keyboard with the label rubbed off. I have lost most of the documentation but I want to find out what monitor I had so I can hook it back up!</div></div><hr />
