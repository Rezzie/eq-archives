<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grath</div><div class="date">Jan 21, 2002, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, ive expanded all the way down the mountain range, with a port city at the bottom with a harbor, plopped a city on the island with horses off the southeast coast of japan and built a harbor there, the horses are connected to the island city, and my continantal port city is connected to the rest of my cities, yet the horses arent available anywhere on the continent!  there are 8  squares of enemy water between the island and my port, so i got a rights of passage with the japs and sailed a boat to the island, still no joy.  in both cities the harbors have the corruption icon next to them, does that make the improvement useless?  i remember an enemy barracks that had the same icon yet it would still heal my units fast.  this sux, what should i do?  i just wasted 5 turns revolting to republic to see if that would fix anything.  taking japan is gonna be a pain in the ass without horses.  and no, no one will trade me horses, the bastards.  thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Headmaster</div><div class="date">Jan 21, 2002, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you need magnetism and/or navigation to transport over ocean squares, astronomy to transport via sea tiles.<br />
<br />
in this case you only need astronomy.<br />
<br />
btw if you build the great lighthouse, can you connect harbours by sea squares?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carbon_Copy</div><div class="date">Feb 03, 2002, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Lighthouse functions exactly like having Astronomy and Magellan until you research Magnetism (though it is not cumulative with Magellan, IIRC).  As long as you possess it, you can establish trade routes that cross over sea squares, that has been established over the course of some of the RBD succession games.</div></div><hr />
