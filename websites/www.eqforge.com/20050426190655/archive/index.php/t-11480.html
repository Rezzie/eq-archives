<br />
1) Improvements are so much more expensive(banks, cathedrals, Universities, factories all +40/20 shields)<br />
<br />
2) Techs are lot more expensive<br />
<br />
3) Light House no longer allow galleys travel safely in OCEAN squares, and i learned that the hard way (I had the Light House, and had a galley with 2 hoplites sank while enroute to the largest continent.)  So I had to build units locally from cities I took from the French for a long time until I research Magnetism :(<br />
<br />
4) Civ leaders are harder to trick now.  All those city trading or when you offer a large amount of gold/turn would be turned down.  And the time laps between war and their willing to accept you audience for peace had increased.  This made it harder to exploite them repeatly while they were losing a war.<br />
<br />
5) Corruption reduction was not really a big deal, did not help much.<br />
<br />
It is not hard to achieve victory, but the patch made it harder to do so.<br />
<br />
So my conclusion is you would get a MUCH better score playing GOTM2 with pre-patched version, that is if you playing my style: early millitary conquest.<br />
