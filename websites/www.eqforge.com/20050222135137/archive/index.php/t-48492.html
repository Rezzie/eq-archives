We will, eventually, discover Monarchy and will need a new science goal.  Where we are in the game by then may impact what we decide to pursue, of course, but wouldn't hurt to start getting some ideas out now.  Philosophy for the extra techs?  Trade for caravans? Map Making for Triremes? A particular Wonder tech?  If you have some thoughts start posting them here.  When we get closer to actually achieving Monarchy someone (I may not be Science Advisor by then) can post an official poll.</div></div><hr />

I'm also wondering if pottery might not be be a good secondary tech to get the Gardens when the camels start walking.  There's nothing like a happy civ. :dance:   I almost always go for trade before philosophy and still don't often have a problem getting the Golden Age.</div></div><hr />

for exemple, the Gardens are much more usefull that the great lib.<br />
<br />
Is it possible to propose a poll about which wonders we would plan to built ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Mar 25, 2003, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I never build the GL these days. Marco Polo is vastly superior to it, using MP you decide which techs you get (via exchanging techs) but when you have the GL you can get useless techs at a bad time (for example when you are about to discover something important, thus delaying your important discovery).<br />
<br />
We should head for philosphy, pottery (=HG) or trade (=MP) next, depending on circumstances. At the moment we are behind the other civs in just about everything so getting philosophy before everyone else may be difficult.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Mar 25, 2003, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Elsaak, I think a poll about what wonders we want is an excellent idea, and could help inform our discussion re: Science.  Jayne, DoM, et. al., would that fall under the domain of the Domestic Advisor?  Or should Elsaak just start one as a concerned citizen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Mar 25, 2003, 10:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it could come under a number of departments. I think to begin with it would be Science because it may guide what tech path we take, then later Domestic to decide when and where to build it. Foreign and Military may also want to campaign for particular Wonders eg Marco's or Sun Tzu.<br />
<br />
I think for now, Leowind, you can post a poll - but if you are short of time then Elsaak may post one for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ideally, polls should be started by the Advisors.  That way we can try to keep things organized and try to avoid times where dicussions may be duplicated and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">puglover</div><div class="date">Apr 04, 2003, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been appointed the new Science Advisor. I chose Leowind for a Deputy. I don't want to start a new thread so I'll just use this one. I think we should aim (after monarchy) for Literacy and the Great Library. We should stay ahead in Science.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">EnriqueCR</div><div class="date">Apr 06, 2003, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I vote for Philosophy as the main objective. An extra tech is very important. I´ve no doubts about discovering philosophy over others</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Apr 06, 2003, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While the cities are small I always prefer to increase science by building something that makes it easier for the cities to grow bigger using WLTP. This results in more science and more production and trade while libraries only increase science. So marketplaces and caravans (to increase happiness via trade) and temples are more useful IMO. I never build libraries until my cities are between 8 and 12 (usually closer to 12) in size, except in the SSC which gets a library immediately after it has a temple and marketplace, without waiting for it to reach a specific size.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2003, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would tend to agree with the Viking.  Marketplaces and Trade will do more in the long term for science than libraries.  Trade would be my option for the next big science goal, but I could support a detour through Philosphy on the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2003, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I assume we are planning to get a Wonder or 2 from the AI.  For that reason, I believe Trade is indispensable.<br />
<br />
I suggest Library in SSC before Market.<br />
SSC Neumatic: Temple 14/40 in 13, grows in 11, problem?<br />
