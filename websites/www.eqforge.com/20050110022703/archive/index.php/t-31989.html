<br />
On my computer it's set up fine - I can share the chosen folder, and issue an invitation to my colleague to subscribe to the folder. However, he receives the invitation as a straightforward e-mail, with no option to accept. On his computer, Outlook reports that Net Folders is correctly installed, and he can issue invitations too. I can receive his invitations and click 'Accept'. The folder is then correctly set up on my machine, but his machine doesn't acknolwedge that I've subscribed.<br />
<br />
This seems to suggest that my setup is OK, but not his. :crazyeye:<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had the same problem?<br />
<br />
BTW, my machine is running Outlook 98, his Outlook 2000.</div></div><hr />
