<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creepster</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2002, 01:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">She had about 650 in my game.  I found here to be a great friend.  She gave me all kinds of cities, money, and techs.  What more could you ask for?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might say she was a friend to me as well, she gave me one city and 3 slaves. May not sound like much, but as a percentage of what she had you might say she gave me a bigger cut.<br />
<br />
Cathy and I go way back, even before CIV3. But in CIV3 I think the breaking point was in a game in February where I had not really been too much into spies but Cathy was my neighbor. The map was a modified version of the continuous alternating land grid with choke points in four direction between almost every land block and where every block can basically only support one metropolis. The modification to the map added more bays and inland seas.<br />
<br />
About every ten to twenty turns, Cathy and Montezuma would take turns puking up a single horseman or cav unit in the coastal cities near my capital and say &quot;Just checking defenses we will leave now.&quot; They didn;t have an ROP and I was usually 1/2 an age to an age in front of them. Just harassment and it went on for almost 1000 years. I finally stopped it by blockading the mouth of the bay with a solid line of 10 destroyers and ironclads.<br />
<br />
During the same game, Cathy kept throwing spies at me like gnats every 3 or 4 turns. I would get messages like &quot;Mr. President, Catherine the Great's spy has been caught trying to steal a technology and was killed.&quot; I still do not know how she could afford to plant a spy and attempt to steal plans or sabotage production at that frequency.<br />
<br />
When I attempted to plant a spy in Russia the first time, the spy was caught and killed and Cathy instantly declared war on me and attacked with two SODs of about 30 cossacks each. My MEch Infantry, Artillery, Cruise Missisles, Modern Armor and other military forces in a railroaded empire made short work of the assault forces. That was also the first game where I realized that 9 times out of 10, my land based bomber aircraft could rarely if ever reach to cities outside my culture boundary because the range was less than the distance between cities. <br />
<br />
It's been downhill ever since. On diety level she either whips me like a redheaded step child or bleeds me dry for extortion money and any thing of value at almost every turn. If I get lucky and am close enough to her to kill her at about 1500BC, then I can have a chance at winning deity.<br />
<br />
I long for the opportunity to have at least one leader and at least one civ that has the fidelty gene truned on so that they can actually be trustworthy and reliable allies. Perhaps MP will give us the chance for these types of games.</div></div><hr />

That is quite the story.  Now I can see why the two of you should never be invited to the same dinner.  I have not had that many problems with her, but I have had the same just testing boudries BS.  France has been kind enough to do that to me in this GOTM.  So I was kind enough to provide Joan wih a quick military lesson on something called Panzers.  She is learning a lot at the moment.:D <br />
<br />
I do know what you mean about never being able to generate a true ally though.  I have tried on many occasions, and they have all failed.  I even gave one civ techs every other turn, and still they ended up turning against me.<br />
<br />
Oh well, the only good civ appears to be a dead one.</div></div><hr />

I would like to encourage people to keep posting there results to this poll so we can get a better cross section of results to reflect how people played the GOTM8 but in a concise format that does not force everyone to read through hundreds of spoiler posts just to get an idea of how things played out. <br />
<br />
I think that some people (like me) are still in the process of playing the game to completion; I could give you my current score for Catherine, but it keeps going down each turn! :lol:<br />
<br />
The polls are a good idea cracker, and although I enjoy reading the spoilers thread once my game is &quot;won&quot;, I know that it can be a chore wading through so many different posts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">watorrey</div><div class="date">Jun 15, 2002, 09:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cathy had 337 points in my game. I let her live with 2 cities that in retrospect would have increased my score some if i had taken them. I started feeling sorry for her and gave her free luxuries and even another little city i didn't want that Joan use to own. She was, of course, furious with me for most of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2002, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please remind players to complete this poll as they submit their GOTM files and as the end of the month nears. This type of poll will be a good summary overview for those players who do not want to wade through the whole sequence of the Spoiler threads and otehr topic discussions just to get a little picture of how their game may have compare to the play sequences of others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">God</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2002, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cracker: Cathy was left with about 95 points. I waited till swordsmen so she got a higher score. The others used archers and got her earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Jun 23, 2002, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Game finished; Cathy had 204 points at it's close. Full write-up will be done (with luck) in a day or two.</div></div><hr />

Look at the final score page for your GOTM-8 game submission and post the final score that you see for Russia (Cathy).<br />
<br />
Then you can use this thread to really bash Cathy all you want.<br />

Remember the real objective of the Civ3 game is to always Kill Cathy. ;) <br />

Now you tell me...</div></div><hr />

I was beginning to wonder if they were the weakest civ or if there was some flaw in the AI programming...</div></div><hr />
