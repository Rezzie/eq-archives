<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 03:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of our 3+ cities are now well prepared to start celebrating to make them grow. When we start this we should have finished the two wonders we want (Bach for celebrations and Magellan for faster ships and to prevent the AI from having it). We can finish them in 2 turns if we are ready to use some cash to speed them (there are not enough caravans near any city to finish them both using caravans only). So I suggest building Bach in Neumatic using the caravans there. This would be accomplished by finishing the caravan there next turn and then dumping the caravans in Neu into the wonder and using cash for what remains. In RF we would start Magellan next turn (I suggest rush buying engineers there now to found a city on Coresux' northern tip; see the relevant build queue poll (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?threadid=57306)), dump the nearby caravans into it and use cash for what remains. Exception: Caravans from cities with less than 3 trade routes (FJ and BP) are to be delivered to Dou.<br />
<br />
It should be noted that having Bach is useful for celebrating, especially if troops need to leave a city to deal with barbarians or AI civ invasions.<br />
<br />
I also suggest building Statue of Liberty in the near future, switching between governments during peacekeeping operations without Oedo year constraints is useful to prevent the senate from interfering and also preventing the AI from switching to fundy and getting lots of cash is nice. However, no AI civ currently has democracy (the Indians are researching it) so SOL can be delayed a bit (maybe even until we have finished celebrating).<br />
<br />
To fund Bach and Magellan and the improvements necessary to keep celebrating and growing I suggest setting taxes to 70% for the next 2 turns. Then we'll start celebrating by setting luxuries to 40%. This is sufficient to start all size 3+ celebrating. Taxes should be kept at 50% to continue gathering cash for stuff like sewers, courthouses and banks. Once the cities start growing we probably need to increase luxuries to more than 40% and rush buy stuff, therefore taxes should be kept high while celebrating.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather spend on improvements and delivery vans.<br />

Rest of the plan sounds good.:goodjob:</div></div><hr />
