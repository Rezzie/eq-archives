I only played a few turns this time, and notice that next year is an oedo year. So if we want to revolute, we can do it now. I suggest we do it next oedo year though, because Mike's could be ready that turn too.<br />
<br />
Things to consider:<br />
<br />
Shall we prepare for republic until next oedo year? Revolution now?<br />
<br />
Shall we build a trireme in Igl or shall we continue with the settler? Both would be ready next turn. I suggest settler.<br />
<br />
FW settler ready - what shall it do? Improve or board trireme?<br />
<br />
Growth halted in VM for now. Shall we leave it like that until Mike's ready?<br />
<br />
How much are we ready to offer other civs techwise to get their maps?<br />
<br />
If we want to trade abroad - Athens seem to have a lot of trade. Wine and river.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">May 21, 2003, 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We should wait for the next Oedo year to prepare for Republic. As stated above, Mike's could be that turn.<br />
<br />
I would continue with the settler. I would like to gain footholds on other continents for assaulting the civs later in the game and would also think we have enough triremes as it si.<br />
<br />
This could go either way, I don't mind either. It would be nice to have more settlers to finish building the infrastructure on the home continent, but at the same time, we should expand. For now, I would go for improvements, but I am partial to either option.<br />
<br />
Even thoguh I am a city growth fan, I want to get Mike's ASAP, so we should just keep it at no growth and leave it like that.<br />
<br />
I would offer them some minor techs, none that could give them a huge advantage. I love getting maps, but am not particularly keen on giving away techs that could help another civ in a large way.<br />
<br />
I think we should give trading abroad a shot. Athens seems good, and Paris might be OK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 22, 2003, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A revolution now is IMO premature, we should wait a few turns until Mike has been completed (hopefully before the next Oedo year).<br />
<br />
The empire seems to be running well but there are a few issues.<br />
<br />
The barbarians near BS show that our defenses are too weak. Had they landed near Igloria (or even LP) instead we'd have lost that city to them. I was disappointed that building crusaders near Igloria (in FW) was voted down last time so I'll include the crusader option again in the next domestic poll :D. Also the Greeks are nearby.<br />
<br />
I notice that the terrain improvement plan from the map I posted has been followed, except near Dou :confused:. IMO roading the forest there is a waste of time at the moment, irrigating the river is better, we want lots of food there. Also building a road directly west from PB is better since it takes a shorter time, gives PB trade from one square and connects it to a future road on the river, thus connecting PB to both LC and Dou instead of Dou only as the forest road does.<br />
<br />
I don't think we badly need the Greek map since they are very near us and thus easy to explore. In fact I don't think we should give the Greeks any techs, they are near us, usually pretty aggressive and we want to conquer them sooner or later (I think we should start military operations against them not too many turns from now).<br />
<br />
One interesting option we have is building barracks and 4-5 crusaders in our eastern cities and visiting Tenochtitlan or the Greeks while the western cities continue developing. This is something for the military/foreign advisors to decide. Also they should decide whether to demand tribute from the Aztecs and Zulus once C5 is founded (the extra $$ would be useful to RB some stuff when we start WLTP). This must happen before republic which is starting to look doubtful since a trireme was not rush bought in Igloria.<br />
<br />
I plan to post a poll earlier now (roughly 12 hours from now) than last time  even though I'm busy, including a complicated deity+2 game where I'm pathetically weak (only 8 rather small cities) but attempting to change that by sneak attacking Persia with a 74 unit military force, including nukes :nuke: :rocket2: :tank: :soldier: :satan:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 22, 2003, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I realized that I wasn't following the plan near Dou when I had moved the first settler on the forest, so I continued. The reason is that I think our SSC should be connected with the rest of the empire, it's very isolated out there. And soon we'll get our first caravan in Dou. The idea is to connect it with LC and PB with Dou. Please insert in poll what to do with them.<br />
<br />
A 74 unit attack, that sounds really fun. :)</div></div><hr />

I see no reason to post a new poll for science priorities: They shall remain as they were: Theory of Gravity (Isaacs); Medicine (Shakes), and Bridge Building/Banking in a tie for third.</div></div><hr />
