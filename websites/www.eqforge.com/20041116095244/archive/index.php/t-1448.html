Wehave several times complained tha the Map Editor was unable to generate  map of more than 10,000 squares... In fact, even if he's unable to GENERATE them, he can effectively WORK and MODIFY them... You only have to open a .sav of the wanted size, than transform it!<br />
<br />
What do you think of that?<br />

Jorrit Vermeirens &quot;MapEdit&quot; util allows for maps up top 10,922 squares, and they work fine with the Mapeditor.<br />
<br />
But MapEdit won't accept maps larger than this, so that leaves out the possibility of making the larger maps with a bmp editor (such as Paintshop), and then converting them into .mp-files with MapEdit. Do you know a way around this?<br />
<br />
-Of course, if there are any great large maps (over 10.922 sq) already made, they can be modified with the mapeditor! Great news! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
Do you know of such monsterlarge maps? I would definitely like to take a look!<br />

If not, it's probably why you don't understand what i'm talking about... Check the link and you'll understand my point. Anyway, as I just said, whatever the siza of the map, The Map Editor is able to work on it, limits apply ONLY on the GENERATION of maps.<br />

<br />
Yes, I heard about it -and I downloaded it too. But it didn't seem to work very well, so I left it alone. It did not work with the mapeditor, which I hoped. But I can see what you mean. If you generate a random map using this patch, then save, and then load in with the mapeditor -things should work out? -Do you know if these maps play on versions of the game without this patch? If they work fine with version without this, then this is really great! I think I'll try it out!<br />
<br />
See ya around,<br />

<br />
As far as I can tell from my small test, the gigantic maps won't work on classic Civ2 (or they will, but with strange bugs), but works fine with MGE, also without the no-limits patch installed! GREAT NEWS!<br />
<br />
NO NEED TO COMPROMISE! Now we can make a monster map of Europe! (or any other part of the world) GREAT! -this allows for even more opportunities in scenarios!<br />
