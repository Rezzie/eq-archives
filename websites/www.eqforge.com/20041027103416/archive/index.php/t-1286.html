oryx is right. Even I can't do a scenario in a month that is decent. A contest is a good idea, but maybe it should be for the best scenario of the year...or of the season...something like that...but we already have the Scenario Hall of Fame...so maybe if you have some nominations, you could send them to me...<br />

<br />
Yes, you're right about the longer to do an scenario.<br />
<br />
But, something what who can be does, that's a contest who will be not too longer but not too short too. So about 3-4 months each? And make a historical each time and a fictious each time. By the way, that'll help the people who only play to have a better choise of variety of one kind of scenario. By exemple (it is only an exemple): Vietnam war. If people search about 37 scenario does, they'll be able to have the best of us! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif And more pacific competition will be on the line for the best creator http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif.<br />

<br />
After all Jesús Balsinde's entry in the First SDC took him just two days to make, and it won the second price!</div></div><hr />

That won't be enough. At first, I thaught I could do mine in 2 weeks, but that's an ilussion. The problem at this moment is that all my .scn and .sav files have been deleted. I found a backup of my scenario, but it's only in the early stages of development. The other problem is I can only &quot;play&quot; two hours a day. Like me, other people have their homework (from school or their job). So I go with the season-thing. <br />
Maybe different levels of creation would be good, too. Otherwise, the new guys would get their first real chance after 2-3 years, and John Valdez or someone else would winn all the time. (I don't wanna say anythin' negative, JV)<br />

This is the ideal place to take over. We can try themes that are less common (a day at the office?) so we can get more variety or impose conditions (like no fighting?).<br />
<br />
I think four months per contest should be about right. (I can do one in two weeks if I'm not doing the art from scratch - only problem is takes another 10 weeks minimum to test, balance and debug it, he he )<br />
