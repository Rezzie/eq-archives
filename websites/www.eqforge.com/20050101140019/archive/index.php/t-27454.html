<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maple</div><div class="date">Jul 18, 2002, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been having problems connecting to the internet. Here are the details:<br />
<br />
I cannot connect to the internet<br />
<br />
My PC is a: <br />
900 mHz AMD Athlon<br />
786 MB Ram<br />
Windows ME<br />
nVidia GeForce2<br />
2x 10GB Drives<br />
-not sure about BIOS-<br />
<br />
<br />
It was a byo (build your own) system, so there it is not a specific model. I have configured my ip settings correctly, replaced the RJ45 wire connecting me to the hub, and even wiped the hard disk and reinstalled windows. I use AT&amp;T Broadband for my ISP, and the cable modem is connected to a hub, which is connected to my computer and another computer. <br />
<br />
The other computer<br />
850 mHz Pentium 3<br />
128 MB Ram<br />
Windows ME<br />
HP Pavillion<br />
40GB Drive<br />
-not sure about BIOS-<br />
<br />
The other computer uses the same ISP, is connected to the same hub, with the same kind of wire. The problems began when I tried to download a copy of Creative Jukebox for my mp3 player. On my third try, I downloaded something called Nomad Explorer. It is an extension of Windows Explorer. It adds the ability to view the player's contents as another drive when it is connected to the computer. <br />
<br />
Anyway, the thing didn't work, so when I opened Internet Explorer (v5.0) to look for a different copy of the program, I got a cannot find server. I looked at my network settings of my computer, and instead of my normal settings, I got the default settings. I entered all of the information back in, and restarted the computer<br />
<br />
The information for my Network Settings<br />
Auto-detect ip address<br />
disable WINS<br />
added my DNS server<br />
added my Gateway<br />
<br />
After I rebooted the machine, I tried to access the internet. I wasn't able to, but I know I can connect to the network. I used ipconfig in dos to see what my IP address was, and used this computer to ping myself. I got responses all within 14ms each. I tried again to connect to the web, but no avail. I reinstalled windows but that did nothing. Then I realized that the Nomad Explorer could of had a virus, so I backed up my data on the second drive and formatted the first one using a startup disk. I then installed Windows ME again, and now still have this problem. :argh: <br />
<br />
Then, I thought it could be the hardware, so I replaced the wire connecting me to the hub. Still have the problem. I would try replacing the card, but the card is build into the motherboard. <br />
<br />
I would REALLY appreciate help, thoughts, ideas, rants, etc on this topic. And I want to play v1.29f civ3. :)<br />
<br />
Other tidbits of info:<br />
On the C: drive (10 GB)<br />
Windows ME<br />
Starcraft: Brood War<br />
Office 2000<br />
Civ3<br />
<br />
On the D: drive (10 GB)<br />
Loots of Music<br />
Lilo and Stitch (movie)<br />
Attack of the Clones (movie)<br />

<br />
ping 65.192.137.178<br />
<br />
(which is forums.civfanatics.com). If the ping works you can enter that ip address in the &quot;Address&quot; field at the top of your browser.<br />

<br />
If neither computers can connect but they can see each other on the LAN, did your try pinging your At&amp;t DNS router ? <br />
<br />
If you were unable to ping the DNS server then the problem may be with your router at your house.<br />
<br />
If you were able to ping the DNS server, but unable to browse the web, then it sounds like At&amp;t's system is the problem and you should contact them.<br />
<br />
As long as both computers can see each other on the LAN, then you should call up at&amp;t and complain because more then likely its a problem with there system.<br />
<br />
When i first got DSL i could connect to there network, but they would not route me out. I had to work with them on the phone for 4 hours till they realized it was THEIR problem and not mine.<br />
<br />
If it is interminent, which is what it sounds like.. its almost certainly a problem with At&amp;t's system.</div></div><hr />

This is really good! :goodjob: As I was answering your questions, I realized that the driver for my ethernet card may be corrupted. Right now I'm reinstalling the driver for the card, but here are the answers to your query:<br />
<br />
sumthinelse-<br />
<br />
This is weird, first I could ping the other computer's ip. Now after the disk has been wiped I can't ping anyone at all. Not the other computer, not civfanatics, not anything! :argh:<br />
<br />

<br />
Other computers can can connect, but I can't see them and they can't see me anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again guys!</div></div><hr />
