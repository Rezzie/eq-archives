<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2002, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Problem<br />
Most problems are related to one of the following:<br />
<br />
1. Errors on your Hard Drive.<br />
2. A registry setting(s).<br />
3. A driver issue, esp. video.<br />
4. Motherboard BIOS.<br />
5. Hardware.<br />
<br />
Description<br />
You have system hangs, video problems, problems after installing new software.<br />
<br />
<br />
Procedure<br />
1.  Collect all the information about your system and software you can.<br />
<br />
2. Open a thread and describe the details of your problem.  The more you provide, the more that others might be able to help.<br />
<br />
3.  As a guide, please try to post the following detail:<br />
<br />
a.  What is the Make and Model (M &amp; M) of your Computer.<br />
<br />
b.  What is the M &amp; M of your video card?  Have you installed the latest stable drivers for it?  What driver revision (&amp; date) are you using?<br />
<br />
c.  BIOS.  Have you ever changed a default BIOS Setting?  Have you flashed (upgraded) the motherboard BIOS (don't do this if you have not already)?<br />
<br />
d.  Are you able to confidently edit your system registry? More importantly, can you back up and restore your registry?<br />
<br />
e. Are you overclocking, or have you set any MB settings yourself? <br />
<br />
f.  What is your computer cooling situation like... e.g., fans, chip attachments, usage of heat transfer grease/teflon. <br />
<br />
g.  Have you upgraded any hardware (e.g., RAM, CPU, CD Rom, Video Card)  yourself? <br />
<br />
h.  What Make and model of hard drives do you use?<br />
<br />
4.  You can just cut and paste the above if you want.  If this seems like a &quot;lot&quot; of work, remember it takes work for others to help you, and the above info will likely increase the useful suggestions you'll get.<br />
<br />
5.  You do not need all the above to post a question, and you may not even be able to find some of the info or understand some of the terms, so just provide all the details you can, even if you think they are not relevant...<br />
<br />
<br />
Caveats<br />
Just post all the info about your problem you can, but you need not have every bit of info to post ;)...<br />
<br />
