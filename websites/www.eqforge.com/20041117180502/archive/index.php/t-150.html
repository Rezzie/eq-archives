<br />
Most of mine were size 1 cities with nothing, but there were the rare size 2 cities with a temple and a marketplace.<br />
<br />
The largest I discovered was a huge size 4 city with temple, marketplace, barracks, granary, and a courthouse.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I had to disband the city because it was in the middle of the desert with minus 3 food.<br />
<br />
Has any of my fellow CivFanatics discovered larger tribes?</div></div><hr />

The computer will only build citieson what it considers 'fertile' terrain: plains and grassland, so I'd've thought that you'd only get advanced tribes on these terrains as well.</div></div><hr />

One time it was in a position that was just missing fish and a whale, and it was encroacing on a nearby city as well.  That was a tough choice, but I think I ended up keeping it where it was.<br />

I never get good stuff like all of the above.<br />
<br />
I only ever get a size one. I vaguely remember getting a few with 'an' improvement inside.<br />

It had a temple, marketplace, granary.  As an aside, whoever it was(oh, Lenin) that said they got a courthouse. . . no, I don't think so.  You NEVER get a courthouse in any city that you capture or acquire.  Even a bribed city loses its courthouse.  It's the game's way of saying that different civs have different laws, so the old courthouse is worthless to the new civ.  You CAN'T acquire a city with a courthouse.  Period.  Well, I never have anyway.  And we all know that I'm just a god incarnate, so it has to be true. . .</div></div><hr />

The later it is, the better/advanced the tribe is. I generally get size 3-4 of city, with something like temple, Marketplace, library, etc. don't remember saw anything higher than 5. Coz I generally don't play till that late.</div></div><hr />

I've never had a city on a desert though. Or Forest even.</div></div><hr />

I don't think the probability changes throughout the game but I'm not sure though.</div></div><hr />
