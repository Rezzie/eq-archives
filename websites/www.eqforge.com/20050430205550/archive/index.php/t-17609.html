<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pearman</div><div class="date">Mar 02, 2002, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, this month is my first GOTM, and I must admit, Im getting my butt kicked.  I would say there is about a 1 in 100 chance of me winning the game at all :crazyeyes <br />
<br />
Anyway, I noticed that fantasy_sports is creating a COTM (cheiftain of the month) contest, and it gave me an idea.  Why dont we have Warlord and Regent games of the month?  They could be VERY informal, maybe we would just post the results as a thread on this board.  We wouldn't need a global standings page or anything, the games could be played purely for training purposes.<br />
<br />
If we did have this, I know I would use it.  I have only completed two civ games so far, both on cheiftain.  I was about to move up to warlord when I found GOTM, and got hooked, even though I stink ;).  If there was a Warlord GOTM I would play it, and probably move up to REgent GOTM the next month, and then I would  be ready to really compete in the real GOTM.<br />
<br />
What do you guys think?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But there will always be one official CFC Game of the Month...per month. ;) Which by the way will also be on easier difficulties occasionally.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I completely agree on the one official GOTM, which is why im suggesting unofficial GOTMs for people to get some experience on.  It would probably help if you guys (namely you, Matrix ;) ) &quot;supported&quot; these games.  In other words, mention them in your announcements of new games maybe, or post an announcement asking for someone to run a game.<br />
<br />
I would be willing to do a warlord GOTM next month, unofficial of course.  That is, if anyone would want to play it.  Would anyone play it if I made a warlord GOTM?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Mar 03, 2002, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's something I need to tell. First of all, in the first GOTM, 11 people got killed. In the second, third and fourth resp. 11, 10 and 11. That's not logical since the second and fourth were more difficult. They did have less submissions.<br />
<br />
But also if the game is beyond your capability you can still play the game. Of course you die (or perhaps even not) but there is always the competition: try to die better than others :rolleyes: so to speak.<br />
<br />
Now, of course playing a too difficult game doesn't help your skill. Therefore you should (also) play games on your difficulty. Also because it's more fun to win than to die. ;) (Although I'm a weirdo who doesn't care much.)<br />
<br />
But then the main problem is: is an unofficial GOTM (just for the rookies) :p fun enough to play? Or can't you just simply play a normal game then? Does it have to be a GOTM?<br />
<br />
In any case, if you're starting a warlord game or anything, I'll make the thread sticky. ;) Unfortunately I can't help you with the results because I'm busy enough. http://www.straland.com/images/smilies/undecided.gif<br />
And I wonder if fantasy_sports isn't going to feel left out. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Oh, and one more thing: I don't perform well in the GOTM's. In the second (monarch) and third (regent) I got killed. So when the fourth started (emperor) I definitely thought I was gonna get slaughtered. But I won histographically. :eek: I surprised myself. ;) ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My personal answer to that would be yes.  I like the whole GOTM thing, except for the fact that I suck ;)  Ive also talked to a bunch of people who would also like to play a newbie GOTM.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thats perfect.  The game would be unofficial and probably pretty small (I would guess maybe 15 people would do it?) so I could handle the results and stuff.  All we would need would be a little moderator help (from you :P) to make sure people know that this is going on.<br />
<br />
This isn't really supposed to be seperate from the GOTM, I will still play the real GOTM.  It will just be to help us sort of train to become good enough to compete in the GOTM.  I would only do this for a month or two, until I felt I was ready to move up, and then it would be up to someone else (like me) to either continue the training GOTM or just let it end, with all the people participating it going full time into the real GOTM.</div></div><hr />

i disagree.  maybe its just me but i usually learn a lot more from getting my butt handed to me on a platter than from victories of any sort, be them decisive or marginal.<br />
