<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm going to appoint one (or more) citizens to a new official position. This position will be primarily tasked with welcoming people to the game and helping them to get into the swing of it. None of the duties are particularly onerous or difficult but if done well this position will do a lot towards getting people into the game quickly and painlessly as well as retaining those folk who drop in and then fade away.<br />
<br />
Duties:<br />
 When a new citizen registers, send a PM or email with a welcome message including links to the Welcome Center, current save game and rule set. Anything else that would help but not overload (frighten away ;) ) the new citizen is also encouraged and up to the official. This can be a standard write up that is sent to each new citizen, with a current link for the save game.<br />
 Help new citizens to get into government. Find out what aspect (department, judicial, governor) they are most interested in and serve as a liason to get them involved in that office.<br />
 Serve as a help desk source. In the welcome PM make sure that the new citizen knows he/she can PM you for advice and help with the game.<br />
 Follow up when new citizens fade away. Keep a hot list of the most recent citizens and check once in a while to see if they are still active in the game. If not, send them a friendly PM encouraging them to come back or at least determine their reason for leaving.<br />
<br />
The person appointed to this position will need to have a good familiarity with the rules, the layout of our forums and a good grasp on the game as a whole, including keeping up with current events.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you are interested! :D</div></div><hr />

Good luck!<br />
Havent we tried doing this on various occasions, only to have it be burried several times?<br />
If we seriously decide to do it this time, I may consider joining. Lord knows this would have been helpful when I started, so I didnt have to make a fool of myself at my first TC by asking &quot;What civ are we?&quot;<br />
Only to get five simultaneous responses of &quot;Persia&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 01:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was discussed in various forms, always got lots of kudos as a great idea, and then always faded away without being implemented.<br />
<br />
This time I'm not discussing, I'm going straight to appointing. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it's possible. This office doesn't conflict with any of the elected offices and is not a &quot;Leader&quot; position.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noldodan</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll join up!  I have lots of free time to do this!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 20, 2003, 04:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eklektikos and Noldodan are appointed to the positions of Directors of Citizen Support as outlined in the first post of this thread. As they say, two heads are better than one.<br />
<br />
It should be fairly easy to coordinate. When one of you responds to a new citizen post, just PM the other so they know that it has been done already. You can get together to develop a standard message for fist contact or go for it individually. It's all in your hands now. :)<br />
<br />
@CivGeneral &amp; SAAM - I appreciate your offers of support as well but chose EK and Noldodan as they do not already have in-game commitments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noldodan</div><div class="date">May 21, 2003, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, Shai.  I have another suggestion: if someone runs for an office for the first time, I suggest that either Ekl or I should kind of help them through their campaign as a mentor of sorts.  Sound good?<br />
<br />
PS - What's with you sig?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">May 22, 2003, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's an excellent idea, Noldodan. Any help you can give to our less experienced citizens to get them involved in the game can only be a benefit.<br />
<br />
My sig? Well, I've been calling John Denver &quot;hellspawn&quot; for many years so when I saw that quote I just had to use it in my sig. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noldodan</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just want to know, does this look like a good part for a PM?<br />

(This part was written a while ago, and so is not heartfelt at all.  In fact, if you wish, just skip down to the next paragraph, as you may find this one to be boring and unhelpful.) Hello, citizen of Fanatica!  Now, according to my job description I’m supposed to do a few things in this message.  This is our Welcome Center, (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=51405) the current save, (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=54293) and our rule set, (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=54293) which is only the Constitution for now.  Also, I would like to let you know that if at any time you have questions, Private Message (PM) them to me. (You can PM from the handy Private Message tab in your User CP)  And if you wish to become involved in government, I can serve as a campaign manager, if you wish.<br />
<br />
(This part of the message has been tailored according to your post in the Citizen Registry thread)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good enough?</div></div><hr />

Maybe tune it to be a little more upbeat and outgoing.</div></div><hr />

BUT I AM!  But on a serious note, I guess I can try to do that.<br />

EDITED VERSION:  (This is the previously-written part of the message.) Hello, citizen of Fanatica!  First, an introduction.  I am Noldodan, but people also call me Nol, Nold or Noldy.  This are links to our Welcome Center, (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=51405) the current save, (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=54293) and our rule set, (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=54293) which is only the Constitution for now.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">May 27, 2003, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since I cant be a full time Director of Citizen Support. I was wondering if it would be possible for me to voluntere my time to be an Assistant to one of the directors. I could be an Assistant to Noldodan :). I know I already have In-Game Commitments, but I would still like to voluntere my time to help others :).</div></div><hr />
