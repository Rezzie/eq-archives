Do some of you have a suggestion of how to improve it? I'm especially unhappy about the way I show what special award everyone has won. (lower lists)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I don´t think it´s so bad, I´m not sure what to improve. :eek:<br />
<br />
The other option would be to list the players by awards again, from most to few. And then only the symbols instead of the name and maybe a seperate column for the earlier awards.<br />
Like this:<br />
<br />
All award winners:<br />
Player                Awards             Earlier awards<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------<br />
SirPleb               Di                 Co  Do  Cu  S<br />
Lucky                 S                  Co  Do  S  FF<br />
...<br />
Where Di, Co, etc. are the appropriate award symbols. :yeah:<br />
<br />
On another note concerning the HoF!<br />
I should have 2 SS awards, one fastests SS and one old SS award. But in the main medals list, only the old SS award is showing! (the shaded one)<br />
Not sure if you don´t want 2 times the more or less same pic, but you also made the distinction between old and new awards anyway.<br />
Just a sidenote.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fossil</div><div class="date">Jul 17, 2002, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've visited the U.S. baseball &quot;Halls of Fame&quot; in Cooperstown, NY. A few observations about it - perhaps you may get some ideas.<br />
<br />
Each member of the Hall had his own &quot;plaque&quot; that listed his accomplishments - years played, teams and career stats. Players from the same era were in proximity.<br />
<br />
Applied here, it would mean organizing the page around players, so that once a player was in the Hall, you could add to his &quot;plaque&quot;, but only a new member would require an additional table entry.<br />
<br />
Also, they made the bloody thing look like a cathedral, as if the players were gods.<br />
<br />
There were also sections of the hall that had team and league history, but these were given less emphasis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creepster</div><div class="date">Jul 18, 2002, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overall I like what currently exists, but here are a few thoughts, <br />
<br />
I like the idea of individual pages for each of the winners.  You could have a similar layout to the one you have and by clicking on the individuals name you could go to their page.  On that page would be some details of the game they won.  Perhaps a screen shot of the map, or details of the statistics for the game (population, GNP, etc.).  If the winner agrees mayby they could submit a writeup of the game strategy that they had in winning that game.  This might help others to see how these people won the game and what was done differently between their game and the winners.<br />
<br />
As for the special awards, I would suggest a different table for them.  each  award should have it's own table seperate from the main table.  For example, every month there is a winner in Diplomacy.  They should be recognized as the outright winner in that field with only their name at the top.  This way you will still have the medals, with their own rankings and others can try for rankings in the seperate categories.  This will help to offset the milking a bit and allow for others to dominate in their own right.  I also imagine that this will get people to try for different victory conditions to get at the top of the ranking.</div></div><hr />
