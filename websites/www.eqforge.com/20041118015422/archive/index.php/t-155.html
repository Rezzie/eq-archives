It was only a few percent higher. The problem is, I don't see how the new top game is better than Komlumbuses.<br />
<br />
In the current top game, there are a bunch of small cities. I saw at least 5 cities that are size TWO!!! An there are cities without full farmland, a bunch of cities under size eight, and only a few future techs.<br />
<br />
In Kolumbuses game, there is only on size 8 city. All the others are size 15, 20, 30, and 40. He also has more future tech, and all of his terrain is developed.<br />
<br />
So how did that guy get higher than Kolumbus? I don't even think he has 254 cities!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kev</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2001, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Vlad:<br />
<br />
That's my game on the top of the HOF Deity.  The reason I had several cities that were relatively small was basically poor planning on my end.  You can probably follow a thread I was writing in in the &quot;general&quot; section of the Civ2 forum entitled &quot;scoring question&quot;.  In essence, I was hapily going along when in 2005 or so I realized that I did not have the max cities.  I eventually DID get to 254, but it was too late - even with &quot;We Love the President Days&quot; and buying improvements - to get them any higher.  It would seem that cities won't go into the WLTPD unless they are size 2 or 3 and for some cities it just never got there.<br />
<br />
I never looked at the last saved game from Kolumbuses, so I don't really know what his cities were like.  I can say that I had most of my cities totally maxed in size - though I did NOT know that you coould increase them with food caravans or by &quot;building&quot; with a settler inside a city.  I didn't do anything like that.  My only thought is:<br />
<br />
His is on an Earth Map while mine was random.  Perhaps the Earth Map has less decent land to use or less land in general.  My population read 10,145 while his was 9,507 so this is my only conclusion.  I don't think the score penalizes you for using the Earth Map.<br />
<br />
For the record, I let the map give me whatever it wanted - I did not set it for a certain temperate zone or age.  I don't think I had any huge advantage as there were plenty of dopey little islands and the like that I had to go and colonize.<br />
<br />
You know, I went to the Apolyton site just for kicks to see if they had a hall of fame as well.  I was amazed to see that there were like 8 or 9 people with scores over 12,000 and the high score was well into the 17,000's.  <br />

It does take a minimum population of three for &quot;We Love the King Day&quot; to kick in.  (Hopefully, when I turn over the Classic Succession Game, we'll have that and the Republic in effect.  Where is that game anyways?)</div></div><hr />

Sorry for the criticism. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
You could've kicked Kolumbuses @ss if you had all those cities fully grown. Nice game!<br />
<br />
I got another question: Why didn't you cut down any of your forests? You could've gotten more food that way, and REALLY kick Kolumbuses butt!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kev</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2001, 03:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Andu- thanks for the verification.  Toward the end of the game I would build a city, speed buy a harbor if applicable, speed buy a supermarket and try to use farmland nearby, and hope.  It was painful to watch those new cities grow so slowly.<br />
<br />
And where IS that succession game??  Does Flatlander have it?<br />
<br />
Vlad:<br />
<br />
Thanks for the compliments.  It was a bit frustrating knowing that there was so much more growing that I could have done.  I DID irrigate away alot of forest - not to mention a ton of swamp and jungle as well.  I did not have total control of the world until the early 1900's, so the work my engineers could do was relatively limited.  I thought it better in some cases to produce farmland on grassland squares (giving 4 food with supermarket) rather than taking the time to irrigate trees to plains, irrigate for two food, and then make into farmland for a total of 3 food with supermarket.<br />
<br />
Given all that, I still don't think it could have come close to the 17,000+ score I saw at Apolyton.  How did they do that???<br />

But after what I learned about food caravans, I know now that it is possible.<br />
<br />
Hey, you could have a city of infinite size! But I think the maximum is 126 (over 50 million people).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Andu, when do you get an upward spike? Only games like Roger Hoffmans and such get upward spikes.</div></div><hr />

Well, it must be close to the Armageddon. Lord, you know that I won’t fly by that lesson you taught me, to pull out my Wesson you brought me, and i’m not stressin’ it softly. Get ‘em up off me, ‘cause all we wanted harmony, been bombin’ ‘em. Yell up outta my ghetto, “I won’t settle,” get on my level.&lt;/FONT c&gt;&lt;/FONT f&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kev</div><div class="date">Mar 17, 2001, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have no way of explaining why the powergraph in my game did what it did (drop all of the way down and then go back to the top again).  I think I remember seeing other games where this phenomenon occured.  I can tell you that I've not once even tried the cheat mode.  What can I say, I never thougt about it and I was never someone who ran experiments.<br />
<br />
I can certainly understand suspicion when the graph hits the top in the first few turns - given what Andu discovered it seems pretty reasonable that someting fishy may have gone on.  Has anyone discovered why the powergraph would go back up?  Perhaps it happens as the game ends with a landing on Alpha Centauri?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goodbye_mr_bond</div><div class="date">Mar 26, 2001, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now I'm really confused. Andu says that a downward spike occurs at 4096, but I'm almost positive I beat that in my last game (gotta go home and check) without my PG going down. I'm assuming you mean population score only, btw.<br />
<br />
Also: I don't know if this is normal or what, but in one of my high-scoring games, my pop suddenly dropped for no reason. It was at 320 mil for so many turns I stopped checking, then the next time I looked it was like 85 mil--without affecting my city sizes at all. This was quite a while ago when I had no contact with other civvers, and I never payed much attention to scores and such then, so I don't remember if my powergraph actually dropped too. THe final percentage score was around 850% on Deity though, with the final pop way under 320 mil.<br />
<br />
Anyway, since then I've been afraid that there's a point beyond which your score actually goes down. Is that true, or is it just a quirk? Unfortunately I didn't save that game as I played, so I have no idea if my score actually crashed down from 1000% plus or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mindfields</div><div class="date">Mar 26, 2001, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The 17000 score can be beaten, but it takes a very long time.  I tried, but stopped the game. It was about 1000ad and i had a score of    13000 - 14000. And i made some mistakes. If i started again i could do better. But it's so boring when you do nothing else then building caravans and move them to cities. I irrigated the entire map twice.  Income of netto 20 thousand. 1 turn takes about 10 minutes, so i stopped playing it.</div></div><hr />
