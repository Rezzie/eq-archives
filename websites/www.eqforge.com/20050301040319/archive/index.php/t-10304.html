1)<br />
Can you ever have more than 1 leader at any time?  I sometimes save a leader for an import wonder for a long time, and I could never get another leader before i use the current one.  After I get my first GL, it is always a tough decision whether to make an army from this GL, then make Heroic Epics; or just save this GL for a wonder you know you need 20 turns from now.<br />
<br />
B.S. The Heroic Epics does not seem to help by too much :(  <br />
<br />
In my current Deity game being Persia, I expanded early and fast against other 15 civs.  As a result, I got a leader early in the game(50AD), I saved him for a while, and finally made an army with him in 250 AD, and build the Heroic Epics.  But the process took so long(until 490 AD), during this period, Egypt build some important wonders: Global Suffrage in 470AD and Hoover Dam in 600AD.  By the time I got my second leader in 620AD, I missed all these import wonders.  <br />
<br />
BTW, Hoover Dam is the key to modern warfare/Space Race win on Deity level.<br />
<br />
When I checked Thebes of the Egypt on 670 AD, its got the Iron Work wonder and is producing 140 shield in 1 turn!!!<br />
<br />
This leads to my second question<br />
<br />
2)  I was lucky enough to have 1 city being able to produce the Iron Works(got both coal and iron in the city radius), I am planning to build it.  What happens if one of these resource expire after i build the Iron Works ?  Anyone know?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

2)I don't know about that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Airness</div><div class="date">Nov 26, 2001, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thx ACM,  let me clarify my first question:<br />
<br />
Did you have 5 leaders at the same time, or they come only when you used your previous leader?  <br />
(when you hit F3, under the &quot;Available Leaders&quot; box, can you have more than 1 at any time?).  I have never had more than 1 leader in any turn in any game i played so far(I was fighting 3 civs with like 25 Elite inmortals in one turn and NO GLs would emerge unless i spend the 1 i current have :( .<br />
<br />
It will be nice to have 2 leaders in you nation, so you can make 1 army, make Heroic Epics and save another for that all important wonder/Forbidden Palace.  :p <br />
<br />
If you did have 5 leaders all availabe(WOW!), what level were you playing?  I wonder how the GL availability were set for different difficulty levels.  Maybe in the hardes levels, the game would not give you more than 1 leader at any time period   :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ACM</div><div class="date">Nov 26, 2001, 07:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got five GLs when playing with the romans on warlord level. I don't remember if I had more than one at the same time (it was my second game, a few weeks ago). <br />
Before the game was launched I saw a picture of three available GLs in the box you mentioned, but I don't remember where (maybe at civ3.com).<br />
The rest of your questions are very subtle and I don't know if anyone can answer them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NetDanzr</div><div class="date">Nov 26, 2001, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. I remember having two leaders at the same time.  I do remember it because it was the only time I got leaders at all (not a big surprise, being as peaceful as I am)...<br />
<br />
2. Nothing - the prerequisite is to have the two resources at the time you begin to build the Iron Works.  It's the same as with disappearing strategic resources - you always get to finish the troops/improvements you started to produce before the resource disappeared.  But if you are afraid that a resource will disappear before you start building the Iron Works, don't connect to that resource until you start building...</div></div><hr />
