Clad in rags, he did speak with great wisdom of a new way of looking at the World. He called himself McNultus. <br />
<br />
Harken unto me ye citizens of this new land, for I bring news of great joy. I speak of a power greater than any mortal force. I speak of the power of the unseen one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crag Ors: McNulty? McNulty is that you?!<br />
<br />
McNultus: Ahh, go to see you old freind. How is CivGeneral and Mara Jade doing<br />
<br />
Crag Ors: They are organising some sourt of Specal Ops. Luckly it is a Government supported thing. CivGeneral is the Commander and Mara Jade is Second-in-Command. I was just on my way over there to sign up<br />
<br />
McNultus: Here are some Documents for you about the power of the unseen one. Hopefully I can see that you become Chaplin of... What is the name of the Spec Ops?<br />
<br />
Crag Ors: The Jade Commandos, and thanks<br />
<br />
Edit, OOC: McNulty, it is perfictly safe so long as (Bleeped out DG2 Nation Name) is not mentioned.</div></div><hr />

Remember, as fare as we know, we don't have even mysticism, much less ceremonial burial.  It'll be awhile before anyone here understands religion...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 01, 2003, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, we can't have religion threads yet (which must be created by a players' character) until Cerimonial Burial. Also, take a look at the new character stats which will be voted on soon.</div></div><hr />
