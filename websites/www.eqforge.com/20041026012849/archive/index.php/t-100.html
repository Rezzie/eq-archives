<br />
1. The go command! 1/3 times, when you tell them to go somewhere really far away, the just go in circles or backa and forth! And they don't even use the railroad. The purposely go off the railroad onto the mountains so they can use up their movement points.<br />
<br />
2. Sometimes, wonders don't work. A lot of the times, my Adam Smith's does not pay for the improvements, and leonardo's only upgrades when you first build it, and when you discover a tech. It should upgrade every turn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Leo's-No.That is how it works.First build and new tech.Not every turn.<br />
<br />
Adam's-pays for improvements that normally cost 1 gold upkeep.Check trade advisor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cunobelin Of Hippo</div><div class="date">Feb 06, 2001, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem that gives me the most grief is the bug in MGE where a tribe at peace with you is all of a sudden at war, with no warning of a sneak attack or declaration. I find myself being attacked by nations that I had treaties with, and they often take new cities it seems.<br />

It calculates the path using only straigh line segments north/south &amp; east west, probalbly somthing to do with cartesian coordinates.  It also does no like to cross the 0 column.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smash</div><div class="date">Feb 07, 2001, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Probably reflects modernization.Ancient barracks would consist of a lean2 or possibly tents.Nowadays it would have dorms,lounges,washrooms etc.<br />
<br />
1stbarracks-1<br />
2nd-2<br />
3rd-3<br />
<br />
That &quot;it says peace but really it is contact&quot; thing is annoying.Embassy's will tell you the true story.Advisor screen will say &quot;peace&quot; but embassy will say &quot;contact&quot;.I've had this happen for many turns consecutively.Had negotiate a new treaty every turn.<br />

<br />
That coastal fortress bug only occurs in your capital city.  It happened me once.  Several people have posted about that bug in the civ2 newsgroup in the past.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TIA</div></div><hr />
