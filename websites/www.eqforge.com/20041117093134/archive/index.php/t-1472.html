<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">allan</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2001, 07:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I finally figured out (with some of you all's help, a thousand thanks) how to move a cities.txt and a rules.txt into a scenario file. I made a sort of &quot;test&quot; scenario where I relocated starting positions on the world map and replaced seven original tribes to new ones: English-Canadians, Germans-Brazilians, Spanish-Colombians, Sioux-Inuit, Chinese-Thai, Japanese-Australians, and Russians-Turks. I edited the cities.txt appropriately too, and that worked out.<br />
<br />
But what happened was, the Brazilians (replacing the Germans), which should have been dark blue in color, were green JUST LIKE the Australians (replacing the Japanese). I.e. they were indistinguishable, which was an issue for me playing the Thai because at one point I was allied with the Australians and they were at war with the Brazilians, and I couldn't tell either apart!<br />
<br />
Anyone know how this could have happened, and how to remedy it? Has anything like this ever happened when you've created scenarios?</div></div><hr />

I find if you change the color of a Civ's flag, that Civ will turn a different color. I've seen every color from black to penis pink. If you changed a flag, just change it back. This might help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">allan</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2001, 11:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I figured out why--I had altered the middle numeral in the first series of numbers after the German (Brazilian) civ name in the rules.txt, and I forgot I did it. I thought these numbers determined the attitude, and when I realized they didn't (it's the next series of numbers), I changed the number I altered back to what I thought it was, but I was wrong. Anyway I forgot all about that when I ran the game. <br />
<br />
I thought of this right after I posted my question. Don't you hate it when you ask a stupid question, then right after you've exposed yourself to some humility you realize the answer? I do....</div></div><hr />
