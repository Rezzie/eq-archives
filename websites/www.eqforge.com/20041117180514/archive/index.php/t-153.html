- The AI changes government far too often, even from Republic to Monarchy (!!)<br />
- The AI rarely uses democracy and consequently loses the science race<br />
- The AI attacks cities with (medieval) naval units such as sails, galleons etc. ! MY ships are far too expensive and important to me to risk them in such a stupid way, , since I want to move troops to attack the enemy<br />
- I doubt the AI sets its science rate even to 40, because in a typical size 10 city there are always abaout 4 happy citizens: how come?<br />
- Barbarians sometimes bypass UNDEFENDED cities (especially in HotSeat)!!<br />
- Exchange of knowledge: I would NEVER give away Monotheism, since I want to build M.s chapel myself (occurs for many wonders)<br />
-Sometimes you will see a &quot;stuck&quot; enemy ship: they just go back and forth, probably due to some error in the backtracking algorithm...<br />
<br />
Some cheats: I doubt that the AI plays fair as far as unhappiness produced by absence of troops is concerned<br />
- well..one cheat, anyway..</div></div><hr />
