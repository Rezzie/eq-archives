Things to consider:<br />
Lots of money, where to spend them? I've tried to adjust the taxrate to the amount of science needed and that has resulted in high taxrates for 2-3 turns where much science wasn't needed. I've also spent them on caravans and an MP in EF.<br />
<br />
Maybe a plan for Shake's, now that the French are building it.<br />
<br />
We'll soon get sanitation, this means we'll be able to celebrate Dou if we want to right after Shake's and sewer are built.<br />
<br />
What about the trireme waiting outside RF, and the two Dou caravans moving towards RF (gold and hides).<br />
<br />
Not many barbs seem to show up outside Berlin.:(  I have only moved the dip on the east side of Berlin though.<br />
<br />
I celebrated EF to the size it was before the settler, and we can get it to 10 or 11 if we want to. Do we?</div></div><hr />

The reason the science ministry agreed to the high tax rate was to spend it on infrastructure and caravans.  I have started developing a more detailed plan to address these items. I don't have my notes with me here, so i won't be able to post anything until later, but it involves rushing nearly everything currently in production and getting shake's by 1100.  More to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2003, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was also going to suggest spending a huge amount of money ;) almost immediately but will wait to see Tim's plan. Having a big amount of cash and not spending it is a bad idea at this stage in the game IMO. I'd like to get Shake well before 1100 AD.<br />
<br />
We can have marketplaces, at least one trade route (preferrably 2-3) in every city on our main continent, harbors where needed, aqueducts everywhere and Shake within a few turns so the big question is: How many turns to democracy ? This is important because if there are only a few turns we'll not celebrate next until we are a democracy, otherwise we'll celebrate all cities to size 12 or more while still a republic.<br />
<br />
Also it seems we need to find a way to squeeze out more settlers somewhere, I'd really like to have 2-4 additional settlers to improve terrain. And too many of our settlers are located in the east.<br />
<br />
We also should start considering build queues for the bigger cities once the stuff mentioned above has been built (banks next or libraries or something else ?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2003, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tim, every time we had a delivery going on I've tried to make sure that we didn't waste anything by lowering the sci rate. So these 2-3 turns were never in a row, and only turns where science would have been lost anyway. A lot of the money also comes from the recent delivery to Ten.<br />
<br />
Plans help me a lot, so they are very welcome.:)</div></div><hr />
