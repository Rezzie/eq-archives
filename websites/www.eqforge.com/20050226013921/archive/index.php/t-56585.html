<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2003, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To build everything we want in our cities to prepare for celebrations we need $$ and the sooner we can celebrate the better. We need a lot of $$ to accomplish this. The total cost of the improvements in MoDA's shopping list is roughly $8000 if we rush buy everything without having accumulated any shields. Needless to say we will always accumulate some shields (at least one turn) before rush buying; this lowers the cost to well under 50% of this. Regarding units (caravans/crusaders), if we IPRB all the units the cost is $2900 but in practice it is considerably lower.<br />
<br />
This is a lot of $$ but I still recommend E1 instead of E4 for several reasons: There are some interesting techs ahead. Also once Dou reaches size 20 all of our trade routes start yielding more $$, in total probably at least an additional $40 per turn and Dou will also soon have a stock exchange. The reason for the initial 70% tax rate is that next turn we will deliver a caravan; if we do too much science now we either have to delay delivering it or the science bonus will be partially wasted. The additional 70% is simply because we need a lot of $$ and also Dou will be about to reach size 20 two turns from now (its size will be 19). Last but not least it's not necessary for us to have finished buying everything when we start celebrating; we can continue buying stuff while celebrating.<br />
<br />
Option C is there because once we celebrate we want as many of our cities as possible to celebrate. This means more emphasis (i.e. rush buying) on poorly developed cities like BS, FJ, BP, BBF etc.<br />
<br />
Option B is there simply because the game has become so complex now that in practice it is impossible to exactly decide everything in advance although priorities can be stated (for example the stuff marked with &quot;RB&quot; (rush buy) in the build queues).<br />
<br />
Option F is there for obvious reasons; we want Adam Smith which requires economics which the Aztecs and Indians have. This is unlikely to become a problem since neither civ has started building it.<br />
<br />
Finally, option G is there if we want more $$ or science for some reasons and do not want to make 'global' changes by adjusting the tax/science rate.</div></div><hr />
