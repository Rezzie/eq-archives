<br />
I have a problem, and i don't think that it's just my cds being dodgy :)  My autoplay doesn't work.  CD's don't start when they're put in.  Also the icon doesn't show up for CDs that always used to work.  Something else might be connected to this - my civ3 cd (which i was hoping to use since i just finished my exams) doesn't seem to work at all (it claims a data file is missing or some such nonsence).  Maybe the CD isn't reading properly.  It sounds hardware-ish to me, but maybe i've just done something stupid to my settings.  Help.<br />
<br />
oh btw, you can still read/explore the cds</div></div><hr />

Try the CDs with another drive to see if they are ok. CDs also wear out if frequently used, especially if frequently taken out and put into the drive and the case.<br />
<br />
Other than that, do what Genghis said. Or go to START/Settings/System Properties/System/Hardware Manager/CD-ROM and make sure that the &quot;Notify on change&quot; box is checked.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

Also - is that hardware manager thing you mentioned just the device manager on win98 - i only assume you're running a different version because mine doesn't have the same thing.</div></div><hr />
