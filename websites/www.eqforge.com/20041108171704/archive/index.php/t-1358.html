There will be FIVE different scenarios in this package and it will be largest single pack of scenarios to be included in a modpack since Kevin Gilbert's Trek Modpack. <br />
<br />
This scenario is an &quot;Early Federation&quot; scenario that plays like a typical &quot;space&quot; version of the TV series. Follow the scenario instructions and tell me what you think. <br />

I apologize for the large sound files...but they are absolutely necessary for the scenario...if they weren't, I would not have included them... http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/biggrin.gif<br />
<br />
For those of you who pay for download time <br />
http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/frown.gif, in the future I will try to make minimal files for your beta tests. <br />
<br />
The good news is that I do not expect to make any changes to the zip files for sound so you probably won't have to download them again...or if I do make changes, I will zip any additional sounds in a separate zip file. (I'll do the same with the additional scenario files).<br />
<br />
hmmm...anything else...I can't think of anything right now...hehe...back to the scenario making...<br />

<br />
Ok, ok...that's a good point...I should have used Robert April for the first Enterprise-- But, I didn't because I wanted to keep the appeal to light trekkers as well. Many might not know that Robert April was the first Captain...although placing George Kirk as first officer was something I hadn't thought of...dang it...<br />
<br />
What I could do is use this scenario to teach about the chronology...that might be a better way to look at it...<br />
<br />
I must be slipping...I should have looked at it that way earlier.<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />

<br />
I've been working on the second scenario for ST:Generations and I couldn't get the first motion picture scenario to make sense so I redid it as The Wrath of Khan. However, I've had to completely chop the scenario to such a point it's not true to the movie really...hmmm...I don't know...it's not a bad scenario...I'm still ironing out playability...it's different...I think I'll send it to you both this weekend to try it out and tell me what you think...<br />
<br />
I've been able to work out some pretty advanced effects for it...but like I said it doesn't follow the movie really...<br />

I'm having fun playing so that's a good sign http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/biggrin.gif<br />

It sounds like a very good approach, JV. The early days are untouched as far as scenarios go, so if it teaches about this era, I'm all for it.<br />

I've been toying around with an idea for my next ST scenario which involves continually changing terrain due to the ripping of the fabric of space time (a la the Wounded Sky by Diane Duane). If it can be done, I'll adapt it to go with Generations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2001, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just tried a few turns to see if I could do the scenario I planned. Seems like you used the Outerspace scheme so I'll have to think of something else.<br />
<br />
By the way, Kirk served on the USS Republic and USS Constitution before Enterprise but not on the ship (can't remeber the name now) that was mentioned in the events message. There is a brother's keeper mini-series of novels that deals with this and it is also mentioned in the ST Encylopedia.<br />
<br />
Second question, did you mean for the science vessel to be the most powerful ship (more powerful than destroyer and reliant) at the start of the scenario? Or did I miss something about the hitpoints/firepower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2001, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the info on the Trek...keep it comin' because I am adding it into the events to tighten it up...<br />
<br />
As for the science ship, Kobayashi, I had to increase its defenses for two reasons:<br />
<br />
One, on the series it seems that these ships lasted forever in a distress call situation...<br />
<br />
Two, the first reason never had anything to do with it...Klingons and Romulans kept trashing the science vessels so I increased their defense strength just you could have a chance to get a colony ship to another local space system. Otherwise, you'd never expand anywhere.<br />
<br />
I raised their cost too...they are basically naval units anyway so they can't do much good to enemy cities...you really need the other ships which are actually air units for attack.<br />
<br />
hmm...let's see...oh...and you could actually use one or two of the terrains to make space fabric if you want to....I've only used the &quot;desert&quot; and &quot;grassland&quot; positions in my map making for these scenarios if I remember right...that would make it possible to make some changes. I don't believe I made any appreciable changes per se to the terrains parameters in the Rules.txt (although I may have and forgot since I've done too many mods).<br />
<br />
Keep me posted.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help on this.<br />
<br />
John</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2001, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you shouldn't call them science vessels. In TMP, Spock boarded the Enterprise from a shuttle which had a warp sled from which it could detach. I suppose the main purpose of the science vessel is to carry the colonoy ships and people so the name is not that suitable - but a warp Sled would fit the bill. You could make it such that the other short range ships would fit ontop of it like for fortress.<br />
<br />
In any case, toning down the attack factor would be a good idea.</div></div><hr />

 &quot;The Cardassian War&quot; idea is on the table...what do you think?<br />
Hard to research, and limited units would be availible, if this is the conquset of Bajor that I think it is. It could be done if the map is only of Bajor, and the units could be insurgents, hitsquads, security forces and so on.<br />

I've decided to go with the Warp Sled idea...it's a good one and I think it makes sense...I'm also changing the attack factor on that...<br />

AoA,<br />
<br />
I'd forgotten about the Klingon/Cardassian War! That would be a perfect for a DS9...<br />
<br />
The &quot;What if&quot; TNG Klingon war is pretty good...I'd never thought about that...<br />
<br />
I've also thought about one recently...the episode where Q flings the Enterprise-D into the Delta Quadrant; essentially the Borg eventually decide to come to the Alpha Quadrant, assimilate Jean-Luc, attack at Wolf 359 and somehow the Enterprise wins...<br />
<br />
willem,<br />

Good idea on the Borg scenario...keep updated...we've got a regular ST thing finally happening...<br />

Also, I'm going through my hard drive to find all the ST scenarios that I have...I want to compare what I've got to everyone else...<br />

MODPACK/SCENARIO AUTHOR NEEDS YOU!<br />
<br />
ST:Generations is near beta testing...soon, there will be some play testing but before I send it out I need volunteers who can commit to playing at least one of these scenarios very thoroughly. In addition, it will mean that I will be implementing changes to the scenarios which will delay my expected release of mid-summer to late summer...but first, let me explain to you what has happened on this MASSIVE project so far:<br />
<br />
1) Massive units overhaul for the last scenario, which I have almost finished. <br />
<br />
2) Some additional sounds never before used in ST scenarios have been added.<br />
<br />
3) The most complete readme I've ever created and VERY trekkish.<br />
<br />
4) The total number of scenarios in this modpack is now finalized; there will be 5 of them to choose from.<br />
<br />
5) Screen shots to be released this weekend from ALL five scenarios. <br />
<br />
I will need at least 5 volunteers, since there are 5 scenarios (AoA, you are already going to get a scenario from me). The reason this is such a big deal is because I have to work on these scenarios simultaneously because they share the SAME modpack. One change often affects the other 4! But in the process, bugs may develop that I've never thought of.<br />
<br />
So, just reply to this thread to volunteer...<br />
