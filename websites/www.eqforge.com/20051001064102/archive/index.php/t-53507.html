<br />
Based on the costs of techs, and our current research, our research time now is 3x the cost of the tech (minus devaluation).<br />
<br />
In other words, Writing's cost is 8, we get it in 24. Masonry is 4, and we get it in 12. Lit's is 10, so we can expect it in 30 turns.<br />
<br />
So, that means we have about 54 turns to prepare for The Great Library. This is why Masonry is so important - the palace prebuild.<br />
<br />
TGL is 400 shields, which means we'd need a city with an average of 7spt. This is why we need a granary for fast growth, and a palace prebuild. Gorina or Penguin would be good for this. Gorina is the better of the two, as it can go above size 6.</div></div><hr />

If you look at F7, America is building the Collosus. Wonders are starting. We don't want to be beaten to the Great Library.</div></div><hr />

CivGeneral looks through Chieftess's Presentation<br />
Uhh Huh. The Wonder race has begun. its time to take innitiatives (Spelling?) to secure the most benifit Wonders for our Empire. In DG2, we were fortunate to capture the GL from the Aztecs once they were done with it. Hopefully this time, we will not lose in the Wonder races :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falcon02</div><div class="date">May 16, 2003, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes we need to start a pre-build as soon as we are able and we have a decent base in our other cities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">May 16, 2003, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If we are to consider a pre-build in Gorina, we may need both a Granary and a Temple first.  If Gorina has only a Granary, it will grow quickly and unhappiness could set in.  Plus, a Temple would culturally expand its city radius so that we have more options available for laborers.<br />
<br />
I would rather have Gorina as the Settler factory for now, as we would only need the Granary to make this happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">May 17, 2003, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think the Great Liberry is all that important.  I also liked the idea of having the Culture Department oversee our Wonder Building Program.  Domestic has enough to do right now so why not spread the work load a little?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falcon02</div><div class="date">May 17, 2003, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What difficulty lvl are we again? Given Donsig's opinion I feel that's a vital factor in deciding what wonders we should aim for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">May 17, 2003, 12:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is not due to the fact its MY city, but I say Penguinadua. Gorina needs to crank out military. Penguinadua is still young and doesnt have a destiny in line, yet. <br />
As stated by others, Gorina should be used now for settlers. Penguin is near no river. It is a hilly city with a cow, which it will not get until it expands. Gorina is by a river. It can grow quickly and make settlers.<br />
At this time in our nation, growth is more important then wonders. Let the citys that grow handle the settlers. Let those that do not handle the wonders. Please, let Penguinadua live up to its namesake (Padua). Let it be the cultural center of arts and science which I have envisioned and its location may make possible.<br />
Get masonry soon, possibly from Abe in a trade. Then, begin work on a prebuild in Penguinadua.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Let Fanatica be great. Let Penguinadua be great. Build the Great Library prebuild in Penguinadua</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Siegmund</div><div class="date">May 18, 2003, 02:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see much point in starting prebuilds when we have no temples and only one luxury.  We still have &quot;pre-prebuilding&quot; to do, preparing a city to grow to a decent size that has reasonable shield production. Peng might be suitable - Gorina at the moment still seems to be our best bet for settler-making, lots of grassland but few shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">May 19, 2003, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get the Great Library on most of my monarch games...not because I aim for it, but because it is what I 'cascade to' when someone beats me to the Pyramids.  We dont' need the GL to keep up in technology at this level, at any rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 19, 2003, 11:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe I just need to hop back down to playing monoarch games again. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You end up waiting around for AGES for everyone else to research.<br />
<br />
I vote skip any wonder building until the middle ages when we have an economy big enough to afford it.<br />
