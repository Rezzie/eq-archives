<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 12, 2003, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not a very big poll this time since there have not been too many turns since the 100 BC polls. This one mainly revolves around improving terrain, especially near Dou and on building more settlers to expand since the knowledge we have of the AI civs through MPE shows that we will get Cope without difficulties and Mike as well unless something highly disastrous happens.<br />
<br />
I think we should build a courthouse next in Dou. This improves science, trade and production by reducing corruption while a marketplace only increase trade. I think we should finish it before starting a wonder - we have enough caravans (and time because we are ahead of the AI civs in science) to finish Cope after we build the courthose. The courthose should probably be rush bought when we discover astronomy. To increase production (meaning we need less $$ to rush buy) I strongly recommend switching to silk in Dou. This also increase trade. Food production is slightly less but not significantly when taking into account roughly how many turns from now we will become a republic and grow Dou using WLTP.<br />
<br />
The settler in option D would build the road between EF and LP and then probably head north to found C5, C6 or C7, possibly first building road from EF to FW.<br />
<br />
Option E reflects the fact that we really need an attacking unit in the east in case enemies show up.<br />
<br />
It's possible that we should try to find time/opportunity to build another elephant and/or diplomat in the west but I'm not including it in the poll this time, it probably wouldn't be finished before the next poll anyway.<br />
<br />
The F options ask what to do with the settlers. I think we should improve the terrain a little before founding new cities so the cities can easily grow with WLTP once we become a republic. Once we are close to finishing building new settlers we can start founding cities.<br />
<br />
I'm not recommending any changes to science/tax/luxuries and probably will not do so until we have discovered monotheism (and maybe republic as well).<br />
<br />
If you disagree with something or have any suggestions please indicate so in this thread.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The results of the poll (at the time of this writing :D) seem to be headed for clear results except for what to build in Doughnutia.<br />
<br />
Sending a caravan from Dou to Ten is as interesting idea but it takes a lot of time. I'd prefer starting with domestic trading by sending caravans to Dou (Dou is busy building improvements and wonders and therefore I do not like spending any time there building caravans). We can build a caravan in Dou once it has finished building a library, courthouse, marketplace, aqueduct and Cope.<br />
<br />
Some additional micromanagement and rush buying issues:<br />
<br />
(1) One turn from now LP should switch to from forest to grassland for one turn to avoid surplus shileds when it competes its caravan.<br />
<br />
(2) The settler production in Ipec or VM (probably Ipec) could be speeded up by rush buying something cheaper now (diplomat) now. I think we should do this or rush buy the settler 3 turns from now since we really need a settler there. I do not recommend simply rush buying the settler now, it's too costly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't look at the city screen, but generally courthouses in this early stage don't help that much.  Marketplace, then Wonder.  I would even build a caravan before a Courthouse, I think. (I might change my tune if I looked at the city screen, though)</div></div><hr />

With a courthouse we get 1 gold less, but 2 more beakers and one more shield at our current tax settings.<br />
<br />
Marketplace and silk: <br />
taxes: 6<br />
sci: 13<br />
4 corruption <br />
1 waste<br />
