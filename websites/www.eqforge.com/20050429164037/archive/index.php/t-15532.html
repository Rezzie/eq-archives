After two Regent and one Monarch level GOTMs, it's time for us to play on a more difficult level: Emperor! This GOTM is more challenging than last month's not just in difficulty levels -- the English's special unit Man-O-War is commonly regarded as a not so useful unit. The good news is that the starting location for this month is excellent and you may be able to use the Man-O-War to good effect on this archipelago map...  :)<br />

I tried it once but got killed before 1000 AD because I never give anything to the AI, not even 5 Gold. :cry: :cry: :cry:  It's time to change that old Civ2 habit I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChumChum</div><div class="date">Feb 05, 2002, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've never played on emporer before so i've started an similar game with the zulu first (who are quite similar to the english except for the early golden age) to get some practice.   (i assume this is ok :rolleyes: ).<br />
<br />
obviously i haven't looked at the english map yet so my question - is archipelago number 1 the lots of water, medium water or little water setting.  cos it will make a difference.  i'm playing on lots of water setting.<br />
<br />
p.s. (its 500AD and the emporer isn't as tough as i thought.  prob because the computer hardly has any landmass, though still seems to research like a mad nun).<br />

<br />
I've been waiting for quite a while now... :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
:goodjob:  I know your doing a Great Job  Matrix, but it seems like you need some help with compiling all the data, right?<br />
<br />
I hope I can keep up my results from the last GOTM...</div></div><hr />
