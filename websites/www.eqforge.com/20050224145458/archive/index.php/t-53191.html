Vote for what tech we want to take next time offered.  Those listed are the ones that should be available to us.  Should we pop a hut and manage to make Polytheism available, it should be taken.  Agreed?<br />
<br />
BTW, I will be at a conference the later half of this week, so am asking my deputy CivGeneral to take over the reigns of the OSR until Monday.</div></div><hr />

It's needed for Bridge building, which we definitely are in need of, and can be traded with others.<br />
<br />
Leo, we are able to get polytheism through tech exchange with the indians. So, we probably will have the alternative to research monotheism. Which I would've voted  for.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">These are the techs we could try to exchange (from head, since I'm at school):<br />
<br />
Iron Working (Indians)<br />
Construction (French)(Chinese)<br />
Warriror Code (Indians)<br />
Polytheism (Indians)(Zulu)(Aztecs)<br />
The wheel (Indians)<br />
<br />
EDIT: List is updated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Several AI civs have polytheism (and construction IIRC) but when exchanging techs we should keep in mind which civ is our key civ.<br />
<br />
We should try to get polytheism from an AI civ so we can research monotheism next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Butter up the Purple civ (our key civ) by gifting heavily to them, and trade for polytheism.  That will make monotheism available as soon as we finish astronomy.  <br />
<br />
If everything remains status quo, and we are given only those choices, I would vote for Republic, with strong thought given to seafaring as my second choice.<br />
<br />
Depending on how many turns will be played (and how much tech trading might go on) you might want to take a slightly longer range view as well.  I believe we have the prereqs for University (although it, like polytheism, will not be offered), and acquiring some of these other techs will open up other possibilities for us.  It would probably be a good idea to start looking at our next priorities...for example, I think seafaring is a good idea and it will open up Navigation, but I would put other things (University for SSC, construction for SSC Aquaduct, Republic, possibly bridge building) ahead of Navigation, but others might feel differently</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I decided to abstain in this poll since I'm assuming we will acquire polytheism from an AI civ, making it possible to research monotheism next.<br />
<br />
Had I voted I'd probably have voted for republic with seafaring as second choice (LP and FW really need harbors). And bridge building (or rather its prereqs) would be nice for roads near our SSC to increase trade. University is a longer term goal for our SSC. We'll need to acquire construction from the AI once we become a republic (aqueduct in the SSC). Navigation isn't as important as it sometimes is, we can easily reach other islands/continents using triremes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As it seems likely we will get Polytheism through trade before we research Astronomy, this poll is likely moot.  Still, may give some guidance next round should we gain a lot of techs via trading.</div></div><hr />
