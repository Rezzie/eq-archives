<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">May 10, 2001, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's most surely in the game code, so you'll need all the hacking tools and knowledge of the inner workings of the machine, that you can get hold of! -It's probably not possible, unless you really get into the program code and knows how this is designed.<br />
<br />
But even if you cannot edit the game code, there are still many ways to improve AI &quot;thinking&quot;. Design of the map, placement of cities and units, and settings of attitudes/reputations surely can go a long way. Also clever ways of using barbarians can also make the AI seem more &quot;clever&quot;. The AI (and human) players has fewer restrains on attacking barbarians than other player tribes, for instance. This can be tweaked quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Also clever use of the Events-file with MGE should also solve many of the AI problems along the way, although this is an area I don't have great experience with.<br />
<br />
Personally I think the AI plays pretty straightforward, but not necessarily stupid. It depends on the scenario, and how the map and units are laid out. The AI makes use of what you give it to play with! Including wonders, improvements, techs, units, cities in favorable spots etc. Thats the key point I think. With all this something can be done, and make for an enjoyable game.<br />
