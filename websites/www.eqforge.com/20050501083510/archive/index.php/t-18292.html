<br />
First of all I don't have the time. Secondly (as has been discussed before many times, but you didn't know that) there will always be one official GOTM with varying difficulties.<br />
<br />
Starting an official GOTM is entirely up to you. You may use this forum for that, but I must tell you that any such attempt hasn't succeeded really well... :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldasar</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2002, 04:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm... But if i would like to i could start an official GOTW (Game Of the week)????? If i had the time and such?? If i could that i will do it later. For now is it to much exams and such.<br />
:) I will join this months GOTM at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the 13th of the month today, and I'm wrapping up my game of the month.  So thats two weeks that it took me to finish this one.  I would have no chance finishing in a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caldasar</div><div class="date">Mar 15, 2002, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah... But the point is a FAST game for peepz interested in it.. U don`t have to be in every week. Or maybe a 2-weeks game... But if it is a game every week we would have new winners all the time instead of the same peepz winning each time because they are MUCH better.</div></div><hr />

http://apolyton.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=136<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the leader there, MarkG seems to be away at the moment and there is no March game yet.<br />
<br />
There is also Chieftain of the Month in the General discussion area for beginning players.  I believe there are also tourney type games, or monthly games on several other sites, for those that need more :)</div></div><hr />
