<br />
I'm having some technical difficulties with the problem and need to .bmp files, and anyone that has the game and at least one of the expansions should be able to help me if they are willing.<br />
<br />
In the C:\Program Files\Maxis\The Sims\UIGraphics\cpanel directory, there are two folders.  In each one is a bmp.  I would appreciate it if anyone who has it could put these in a .zip and attatch them here.<br />
<br />
If they do, I will be eternelly indebted to them :).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

I don't have that game.  A good place (well, as good as you're likely to find at CFC for a Sims question) might be the All Other Games Forum:<br />

PS, I had a thought.... there might be a &quot;Sims&quot; website where you'd find lots of Sim-ers more rapidly  :).</div></div><hr />
