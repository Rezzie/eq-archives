We're in the middle of celebrating, shall we continue with it for a while, or is it time we wage active war against anyone? The french with only one city left aren't very keen on fighting...<br />
<br />
There are wonders to build CfC and WS, andthe reason I haven't built WS is that it's tempting to deliver the vans instead of using them for the wonders. With our new factories and the money we have, we probably can build them in 2 turns if we want.<br />
<br />
What to do with the barbarians approaching Ipec? We don't have time to build a warship, so we need to defend it, but how?<br />
<br />
I've picked what seems best in science, but I have chosen not to pursue some dead-end techs like Espionage and guerilla wf (won't give us much until Mass Prod), but maybe we want them?<br />
<br />
There are a whole bunch of freights in LP, BP and outside Ten and also one outside Delhi, but one good delivery per turn seems to be enoough for science, so they queue sometimes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedBull</div><div class="date">Sep 27, 2003, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It might be a good (read: fun) idea to leave that French city as our pet...<br />
<br />
The Aztecs look ripe for eliminating after we get ourselves some armor, eh?<br />
<br />
Espionage might do us well if we were to immediately follow its research with another war.  It'd be nice to run spies alongside armor to leave the armor free to concentrate on clearing out and taking cities as the spies quickly and efficiently &quot;clear&quot; the battlefield ahead.</div></div><hr />

I'll try reminding some of them to give their input.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still, it's not a bad idea to go ahead and build WS, then use it to take out a few civs with the lower war weariness.</div></div><hr />
