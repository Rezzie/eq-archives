My reason is entirely just for my own entertainment. I have some knowledge as to how programming languages work. Any suggestions? I seem unable to find anything that does what I need. That is, accept user input, and simple animations, music, sound effects, and be FREE. Preferably including a manual or tutorial so I could actually learn the thing :rolleyes: <br />

Here is one that is free:  MS Visual Basic 6.  The books like &quot;Sam's Teach yourself Visual Basic 6 in 24 hours&quot; include a the MS VB  program on CD for free (subject to a certain limitaion or two).  C++ is another one.  But I'm more of a practical person; there may be other &quot;simple&quot; starter languages, but I just don't use or know about them.  :)</div></div><hr />

You can solve almost any problem without going too deep into real programming. Many interfaces and classes are already freely distributed, so it´s not too big of a problem to create a great program.<br />

<br />
My 2 cents... I suggest you start programming using DOS tools. Normally, I would suggest MS QBasic to start with, since you probably have it if you use Windows, but your age suggests that you could start off with Pascal. Most people I know (that have started at your age) started with Pascal and then (not necessarily) made a transition to C.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jun 22, 2002, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">C++, the language itself, is free. What you see people charging for are the compliers and editors and debuggers. If you live near any Office Depots, Office Max, or Staples go into the store and look in there computer programs section. A lot of times they carry some old MS Visual C++ (like 4 or 5 and maybe even 6 soon) programs for $25-$40. I have also seen Visual Basic sold for cheap also. They were in yellow boxes but I cannot remember what company was selling them (it wasn't MS).<br />
<br />
The are also free compliers and editors online. Do a search on &quot;Free C++ Complier&quot; that should give you a few hits. Unfortunately they aren't as user friendly as the non-fre products.<br />
<br />
Also, you could always type a program in wordpad or notepad. You would still need to debug it and compile it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lovro</div><div class="date">Jun 23, 2002, 03:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://www.delorie.com/djgpp is a freeware C/C++ compiler. It is a port of the Linux GCC. It also includes an IDE  (Integrated Developement Environment, you can call it an &quot;editor&quot;) called RHIDE which is buggy, but will run properly under Win9x systems. I personally do not use the IDE, but write in an editor (joe) and compile from the command line.<br />
<br />
http://www.freepascal.org/ is a freeware Pascal compiler available both for Windows and Linux systems. It also includes its own IDE, which is even buggier than RHIDE, but still usable under some systems. When in need of Pascal, I also program using an ordinary editor and the compile the program from the command line.<br />

Both of these are &quot;new-generation&quot;, free 32-bit compilers and used very widely.</div></div><hr />

The Simple Direct Media Layer (SDL) is a free, cross platform toolkit for writing games using C/C++.<br />
<br />
If you want to try something easier, try the language Python. It's free, easy to use, and a *great* language to boot. It has a free library called PyGame, which can be used to write games in. Python also integrates very well with C and C++, so you can write the speed-critical parts in those languages.<br />

<br />
Further, I think that the Java language is badly mis-designed. Its type system is stuffed up very badly, and it is simply lacking in the powerful features that makes C++ great. Its one redeeming feature is static exception specification checking; but that's not near good enough to bring it in line with C++.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh.. ok, for real now .. :)<br />
<br />
For learning programming, including OO concepts and to in general get the hang of what &quot;programming is like&quot;, I would recommend Java. It has the benefit of being a &quot;real language&quot;, and besides I do consider it to be the most elegant general purpose language around... in this, I would strongly disagree with Sirp. Of course, Lisp is THE language, but it's not really something you'd use for everything you do...<br />
<br />
C++ is something I touch only when I must. That is, when I need to do platform-specific, really, really quick code. They say that C++ gives you all the rope you need to hang yourself, and they're so right. C++ is powerful for sure, but in elegance and having a good core set of features, Java wins hands down.<br />
<br />
I think the only thing Java could have that it doesn't is templates, but I'm not sure...<br />
<br />
Btw, I don't want to be a spoilsport, but &quot;I want to make games&quot; is what most programming newbies say... and then they realize that games programming is one of the most demanding fields in software development... it's not something you just start to do as your first thing, unless the games you have in mind are something akin to Minesweeper or Tetris.<br />
<br />
EDIT: *nngh*, sorry for responding to a year-old thread, didn't look at the dates...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirp</div><div class="date">Sep 08, 2003, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's okay: a year later Java still sucks :-)<br />
<br />
When I programmed in Java, it just made it incredibly irritating to do all the things you typically want to do in a program. Say you want to store a whole heap of integers, in a long list, populating the list and then perhaps performing operations on it. To create the list, in Java, you go,<br />
<br />
ArrayList mynumbers = new ArrayList() ;<br />
<br />
In C++, for instance, it's,<br />
<br />
vector&lt;int&gt; mynumbers;<br />
<br />
Not so bad either way. To add the number '5' to the end of the list, in Java it's,<br />
<br />
mynumbers.add(new Integer(5)) ;<br />
<br />
Which is starting to look a little awkward. This is due to the inelegance of primitive types not being treatable as objects, so it has to be 'wrapped' in this Integer type.<br />
<br />
In C++ it's as easy as one could expect:<br />
<br />
mynumbers.push_back(5) ;<br />
<br />
C++ also has better type checking here. In the Java version you could accidentally add something which isn't a number to your list of numbers, and then later on, boom. The C++ compiler will guarantee that you really do add an integer to the list of numbers.<br />
<br />
Then we come to the real killer when you want to get, say, the 3rd number back out of the list again, in Java it's,<br />
<br />
((Integer)mynumbers.get(2)).intValue()<br />
<br />
While in C++ it's,<br />
<br />
mynumbers[2]<br />
<br />
You call a language which requires the above construction just to get a number out of a container 'elegant'?<br />
<br />
Of course to make your code truly robust in Java, you are going to have to catch the bad cast exception that could occur if the object in the container isn't really an Integer. (Of course, you can just write your code asserting that your container always has only Integers in it, however either way, it's more burden on the programmer). C++ will guarantee that the container only ever contains ints.<br />
<br />
This kind of horrible casting everywhere is the anti-thesis of 'elegance', and was horribly irritating when I had to program in Java, and is horribly irritating to me now that I have to program in C# (which is very similiar to Java, but worse, because it leaves out Java's only mildly redemptive feature).<br />
<br />
Then there's the way Java (mis)uses exceptions. It's a nice feature that Java has well-defined behavior on an array-out-of-bounds error. The problem is what that behavior is: anytime I make such a programming error, I want to get an immediate assertion failure of some type, hopefully with a nice stack trace. Instead Java throws an exception.<br />
<br />
Why would someone want to throw an exception on a programming error? Exceptions are useful if you are going to handle an error and perhaps recover from it. If your own program has a bug in it, there's no way you can gracefully handle it or recover from it. Exceptions are useful if your database fails, or if your network connection dies, or the system runs out of memory, or the user enters bad input. They are not useful if your program has a bug in it. Why the Java designers think they would be is beyond me...<br />
<br />
Further, making your program exception-safe in Java is a nightmare. I have frequently had to have nested try...catch...finally blocks to do it, and verifying that all possible code paths will satisfy your desire exception-safety requirements is very difficult. Further, since so many things can throw exceptions in Java, guaranteeing transactional exception safety semantics (i.e. if a function throws an exception then it will leave the program state otherwise untouched) can be very difficult.<br />
<br />
As an example, suppose you have a function which is going to call three operations: op1(), op2(), and op3(). Each of these operations will throw an exception if the operation fails. If an operation fails, you want to ensure that your function exits with none of the operations having completed. You have the functions op1Rollback(), op2Rollback(), and op3Rollback() which can rollback an operation that has been done. Doing this in Java requires nested try...finally blocks. It can be implemented in C++ without any try blocks at all, and with lots less headaches for the programmer.<br />
<br />
That's not to say C++ is the greatest programming language either. It has issues, big issues. Its difficulty to learn being the most prominent. Its undefined behavior and inconsistent implementations also being severe problems. It is elegant in some parts, but ugly in others.<br />
<br />
The only truly 'elegant' languages I have used aren't used nearly enough in practice - languages like Haskell and Lisp.<br />

<br />
I could go on and on about how cool the latest features in Boost are that are set to be standardized in the next revision of the C++ standard.

I'm kind of a newbie when it comes to java, but I'm not too bad. From what I've heard C/C++ is much better, and beats java in the long run, I think you make java a bit to hard though in your array example. What's wrong with this code:<br />
int[] a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};<br />
System.out.println(a[1]); <br />
<br />
It does the same thing, only using the data type int instead of the class Integer. If you dynamically want to add numbers to an int array, the code isn't worse than this:<br />
int[] b = new int[4];<br />
for (int i = 0;i&lt;b.length;i++){<br />
    b[i]=(i+1)*2;<br />
}<br />
System.out.println(b[1]);<br />
You seem to be an experienced programmer, so you probably have good reasons to not liking java, I just thought it sounded worse than it is when you described it.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirp</div><div class="date">Sep 10, 2003, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">funxus,<br />
<br />
The problem with using arrays the way you show is that resizing them (1) takes a for loop, which is horrible to do just to add an item to the end of an array - the code I wrote didn't look nice, but is far better than actually having a (!) loop construct for such simple operations (2) is an O(n) time operation, which is unacceptable in any container. (In simple terms: it's slow).<br />
<br />
The entire reason why there's a vector class in C++ is because having to do this all the time is horrid, not to mention terribly inefficient.<br />
<br />
Suppose we were writing a program that received incoming network packets. Every time we received a network packet we would log the length of the packet and add the length to the end of the array.<br />
<br />
Suppose over the life of the program it received 1,000,000 packets and so had an array of 1,000,000 integers. Given your implementation, it'd have to allocate one million arrays, and copy around half a TRILLION integers around.<br />
<br />
The implementation I gave, using ArrayList, would probably make around 30 allocations [1], and copy around maybe 3 million integers.<br />
<br />
You could argue that your implementation is easier if you'd like (although I'd disagree, casts are bad, but I'd take one over an error-prone loop), but it's certainly not better with how unscalable it is.<br />
<br />
-Sirp.<br />
<br />
[1] Actually it's likely Java would have to make a heap allocation every time you called new Integer, so that'd probably be still a million allocations. But they'd be smaller. The C++ implementation, on my compiler and library implementation, makes just 21 allocations, and 1.04 million integer copies.</div></div><hr />

I can only say &quot;Too true, Too true&quot;. It may be something I dont like about tutorial-style teaching, but claiming that you will be taught C++ in 21 days by copying code out of a book is a whole heap of *10#.<br />
<br />
Tell me, is the Stroustrup book too complicated? I have heard heaps of conflicting reviews on amazon.com. Some go to the extent of saying &quot;it is good for beginners&quot;, then others say &quot;not for beginners&quot;. But then, the same was said for the Kernighan and Ritchie C book. Which says something about amazon.com's reviews...<br />
<br />

Thanks, everyone. Essentially, my purpose is to make games. My main question is &quot;What is a good Freeware language and where can I get it?&quot; C++ is out, because, IIRC, it costs money, I can't find a good site offering Pascal, and other languages either cost money to get the compiler, or don't offer the functions I need. But, then, perhaps the difficulty just comes out of a bad search engine. ;) <br />
<br />
C++ doesn't cost anything. You can get a very good and free compiler from either Borland(www.borland.com) or GNU (www.gnu.org). Plus there are several good editors out there.<br />
<br />
If you want a good language set search for &quot;DJGPP&quot;. For an editor search &quot;Rhide&quot;...<br />
<br />
IIRC, Gnu also has a compiler for Windows.<br />
