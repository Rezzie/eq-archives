<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2002, 08:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started this new thread because I have really been encountering the civilization &quot;respawning&quot; phenomenon in the GOTMs at way too high a rate.<br />
<br />
For those people who may not have notice respawning, it is the effect where you charge an army over against an opponent early in the game and destroy his/her last city, only to have a new city reappear by immaculate conception at a new location.<br />
<br />
I have opened the autosave files to verify that this is a magic internal bug and not just a lucky settler escaping. In my games, the civs typically respawn with 3 spearman, 1 archer/bowman, 1 settler, and 1 worker plus the new freeby city. This new unit ratio even occured in GOTM6 at warlord level.<br />
<br />
Spent time on the phone with Firaxis Tech support and they say respawning does not and should not occur under the V1.17 standard rules. Quoting Firaxis &quot;We all play the game everyday,, and have never seen this respawning thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tech support suggested that something in the GOTM map files is corrupting the game code and causing respawning when respawning should not be occuring.<br />
<br />
I would like to invite a little discussion of respawning and its impacts.<br />
<br />
My personal take is that it should not be occuring and we need to get Firaxis to fix the problem. Then everyone could just play at a higher difficulty level in a more realistib mode instead of giving the AI's a free second chance at every Civ.<br />
<br />
more later ....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2002, 09:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Respawning happens when there are large tracts of land still unsettled or without any roaming units.  Usually this means a civ will respawn 1 or 2 times if taken out early.  The most I have seen is 3 respawns by the same civ.<br />
<br />
I don't see it as a problem in GOTM's.  It should work the same for everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grey Fox</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2002, 10:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Aeson. There is teqniques in hindering the AI to respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sparrowhawk</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2002, 07:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a very annoying respawn happen in GOTM 5.  I killed the french early on (like 2000BC) and they respawned about 7 units and a new city.  So despite what Firaxis may say, it does happen.<br />
<br />
As for whether it impacts the GOTM -&gt; I don't think so.  It was incredibly annoying, but really, I had the land I wanted and they still had nothing.  Obviously it will impact aggressive players more, but I don't see how it could unbalance things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melanic Sheep</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2002, 01:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Respawning happens, Mabey the firaxians are on glue....<br />
Or Mabey they havn't been able to wipe a civ out while there was available land space ;) ....  But I find that hard to believe.  I wonder why they would deny that respawning occurs? <br />
<br />
Sorry i didn't add anything of real value, but I've seen it happen with my very own eyes.</div></div><hr />
