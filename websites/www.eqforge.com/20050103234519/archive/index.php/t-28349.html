<br />
Thats what the technician said to me.<br />
<br />
I was innocently surfing the net,Apolyton as a matter of fact,when my IE froze.So I wait a sec for task manager to come and say &quot;this program not responding blah blah&quot; when my mouse freezes.<br />
Hmmmm.<br />
A few minutes later I get the BLUE screen of death.<br />
Uh oh.<br />
I restart but get yet another blue screen with a new message.<br />
I restart again<br />
I am now down to a black dos prompt screen with &quot;F1-help&quot; and &quot;F2-setup&quot;<br />
Setup reports there is no hard disk installed and no cd-rom drive installed.So much for last resort -re-install OS.<br />
It was right about here I had visions of macintosh in my head.<br />
<br />
Off to technician.<br />
$429 and all is well.No data lost.<br />
Techie has no idea what caused it.This is unsettling to me.I kinda had hoped to hear &quot;Virus&quot; although I have no idea how it snuck thru if  it was.<br />
<br />
He says all checks out well inside as it should only being 6 months old.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid to go to Apolyton now ;)<br />
<br />
Did I miss a big one lately or was it just me? :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Often there is no visible reason behind it. I had such a problem a few months ago, I started my computer the one day and he couldn´t boot Windoze. :eek:<br />
Somehow he managed to put most of the needed vxd and dll files in the Windows/System dir into 4 big unreadable files. No idea how that happened, he somehow must have made a mistake when writing the adress table for the HD.<br />
<br />
It´s rather difficult to find out the reasons, Murphy´s law really rules the world, especially the computer world.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
What did the technician charge you $429 for?  I hope that is Canadian, and not USD  (that's about $270 USD, I think).<br />
<br />
What did he do, exactly?<br />
<br />
<br />
For free, I could have told you what happened, how to fix it, and how to prevent data loss if (when) it happens again ;).<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not have access to your computer, and cannot check certain things to be 100% sure, but this is very probably what happened:<br />
<br />
1.  MSIE caused a routine fault.  It does this a lot, and is extrememly bug-ridden, particularly with heap problems and out of bounds references under certain circumstances.<br />
<br />
2.  Most MSIE faults will, at worst, corrupt some disk files that are relatively unimportant.  But you very likely (like most people) allow windows to put temporary files on your boot drive.  This increases the chance of boot drive corruption with the routine MS beta software that people mistakenly call an &quot;OPERATING Styem&quot;.<br />
<br />
3.  In this case, given that you said the machine would not recognize the hard drive, at least one key bit (and maybe more) in a special part of your hard drive was corrupted.  The BIOS then will not recognize the hard drive, but the data structure is intact.  It requires gooting from a CDROM or A: drive to fix.<br />
<br />
4.  Another possible case:  The glitch was caused by heat (not M$) and altered a bit in your machine somewhere, and this also triggered a change in BIOS setting.  It required entering BIOS setup at boot to correct the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, those are a couple very likely candidates, given what you described so far.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone reading this should learn something:  you need to back up your partition information onto a Floppy disk, and be able to restore it if your drive is corrupted either by M$, or a virus.  Good programs to do this are Fix It Utilities and Norton Utilities.  Key data necessary to restore a drive is typically stored in an &quot;image&quot; file (about 300K on average).   BTW, Partition Magic can repair certain things (not all) in some circumstances.<br />
<br />
<br />
Glad your machine is working.... let us know the details of what the tech did to it  :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I took my computer in one time and got charged $25 USD...much more reasonable but nothing was replaced...they just removed a few extra studs I didn't need...d'oh! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
It required 8-9 hours to fix as secondary problems were found.I know I know,but that was my only choice.I lacked the equpiment and/or knowledge to do anymore than I had tryed.Most of the time was spent in retreival.Their rates were:free pickup,free estimate,free delivery and $65 per hour.As hours began to rack up I flat rated at $375 plus tax.Over $50 in taxes :mad: <br />
<br />
The only way to to do anything required a 2nd computer and some diagostic software.<br />
<br />
The &quot;popular&quot; rate at other places was $75 per hour with a range of $35&gt;50 for an initial consultation, but none of them seemed too interested in my business.One guy's phone answerer offered to have the guy phone me for an estimate of when he could just talk to me about it!.Future Shop said 2 weeks minimum :eek:.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Ouch!  There were many more problems than I thought  :eek: ...<br />
<br />
One thing that is both fast and easy to do is to keep a 2nd hard drive (they are so cheap and large today) with a backup of essential stuff, esp. data.    IDE CD-RW ROMs are pretty cheap, and make a great way to backup drives, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The places I have dealt with (mostly by phone pricing around) were all flat rate, 25 bucks to find out the problem, and then they would talk about the cost. Charging by the hour to figure out the problem seems wrong. If you are good it shouldn't take you too long. :) You need to get a computer hardware nerd friend. ;)</div></div><hr />

For anybody that cares or knows,here is the jist of what my screen said:<br />
<br />
disable bios memory options such as caching or shadowing<br />

<br />
&lt;end&gt;<br />
whatever all that means.<br />
I got it back,it booted to windows ok.Then I couldn't open the start menu,followed shortly by the SAME thing.<br />
So,I unplugged everything and held the power button for abit.Re hooked everything and did a couple of restarts before it finally seemed to be working.I did another restart to seeand here I am.Up and running,but for how long?<br />
<br />
I'm running Mozilla as my previous glithes happened with IE.Probably not the problem but can't hurt ;)</div></div><hr />

I think it is something along the lines of what starlifter's last post discussed.I beleive the app in question is IE.This was what I was using when the problems occurred.<br />
Since I am on XP,I am little more than a guinea pig as there have been more patches and updates than you can shake a stick at.<br />
<br />
It is still working.Seemingly ok.<br />

<br />
In Netscape 6.xx, this will do:<br />

<br />
<br />
BTW, my post asking for lots of specific information was not babble.  With that specific info, the cause of your problem might well be determined, but no guarantees.<br />
<br />
Anything that you can specifically state that the Tech dude tested can eliminate entire troubleshooting branches (assuming the tech really knew what he was doing, and at his prices, I am definitely presuming he knows his business ;: ).<br />
<br />
Unless you know what you're doing (or at least carefully write down the original settigs), changing BIOS can be a pain.  Do not touch the settings on the first page related to disk geometry, however.  That is one way to mess up your disk drive(s) if you make certain unfortunate choices.<br />
<br />
<br />
You will not hurt anything physical be enabling and disabling the Shadowing.<br />
<br />
I will explain what shadowing is.  In the old days (the wild west of the 1980's and early 90's), comuters were slow, and ROM was dead slow.  Most monitors displayed tables of code characters that were translated into symbols, like numbers and letters.  It was quite slow to use ROM to look up these values, so someone came up with the bright idea to copy the ROM contents into the much faster RAM.  But there was a drawback.  Machines had RAM on the order of 256K, 512K, 640K and 1024K.   RAM was very very expensive, and available space was limited.... so they put an option in BIOS to enable this copying of data into the faster, but limited, RAM.  Since this was a duplicate of data, it became known as Shadowing.   In today's machines, and with the modern graphics cards, screens are bitmapped in copious quantities of RAM, and there is no longer the need to shadow ROM into RAM... you simply don't use it if you don't operate in text mode (e.g., DOS).  And even if you did use DOS, today's machines are so fast that you don't need the shadow anyway.  Besides, the speedup is only noticiable when producing vast amounts of characters to the screen in rapid succession.... I doubt most people even have applications that can do that in DOS anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Soooo.... you should indeed turn off shadowing.  More than just video character talbes can be shadowed, but nothing needs it anymore.  In fact, some stupid programmers of today actually produce software that will crap out if certain things ARE shadowed.  MS has never been particularly adept at producing quality software, and MS IE is one of their worst examples of bug-ridden crap... it has memory leaks, exploits you can park a car in, and is generally unstable, esp. over time and use in a session.  It would be quite in keeping that the arrogant, and simultaneously incompetant, child-like programmers of MS IE have yet another bug in MS IE that causes a crash with some hardware + BIOS + MS Application combinations.  I have documented some of these (but not yours in particular) to MS, who is thoroughly ungrateful and attempts to shift the blame to others when you talk to them.  I do more than talk... I know people there and actually have gone in person to discuss certain compiler and network issues with them in the past.  The just have a few people that consider themselves legends in their own minds, and it spoils the efforts of their employees who are rather meek, but actually  know more about what is going on.<br />
<br />
<br />
So....  try it, if your techie did not... that is, turn off all the shadowing and see if stabilty improves.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smash</div><div class="date">Aug 08, 2002, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh I know it wasn't babble but I wouldn't know where to get all the info required :o <br />
<br />
I have that checked in Mozilla but it isn't the default browser :confused: <br />
<br />
How do I turn shadowing off? :crazyeye:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kundor</div><div class="date">Aug 09, 2002, 09:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Go into BIOS.  When you boot up, there likely will be a line that says &quot;Hit Del to enter setup&quot; or maybe &quot;F1&quot;.  In any case, hit that key, then look through the settings until you see a setting saying something like &quot;BIOs Shadows&quot; or whatever, and make sure it's Disabled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Aug 09, 2002, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't IE / Windows pretty much completely integrated now?:  (IE being largely a an interface to windows functionallity???)<br />
<br />
If so, is it the &quot;interface&quot; that is causing the conflict, or part of windows underneath?<br />
<br />
Eg.  If it is some form of hardware or driver conflict, then it may not be limited to just IE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Aug 09, 2002, 02:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ainwood is right about there being more than meets the eye here.  I have run even unpathced versions of MS IE 5.01, 5.01 SP1, 5.01 SP2, and even 5.5 with shadowing on and off on different systems.  But it is practically impossible to try and explain everyinthing to do to check stuff via typing... it is even frustrating to work with a troublesome system in person, and can take hours to work though combinations of things to get at the root problem.<br />
<br />
But since Shadowing was mentioned, and you do not need it to run you system, then it won't hurt to turn it off and see if stability improves.  It can be quite difficult to trap the chunk of code that triggers in some circumstance and conflicts with the Shadowed RAM.  In theory, that is not supposed to be allowed by the OS... and a well-written application (that was properly tested, too) would not cause it.<br />
<br />
In BIOS, you will find entries like these:<br />
<br />
PCI/VGA Pallette Snoop<br />
Video ROM  BIOS Shadow<br />
C8000-CBFFF Shadow<br />
D0000-D3FFF Shadow<br />
DC000-D7FFF Shadow<br />
D4000-DBFFF Shadow<br />
D8000-DBFFF Shadow<br />
DC000-DFFFF Shadow<br />
<br />
<br />
Write down what their current setting is, then set them all to &quot;Disabled&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some comments, so you know.  The Snoop can conflict with some graphics cards if enabled.  However, some card need it to keep the right colors on your screen.  I doubt anyone reading this post needs the Snoop enabled.<br />
<br />
We talked about Video ROM in my last post.<br />
 <br />
The upper memory shadowing (C80000-DFFFF) is primarily for certain expansion cards, which I doubt you have installed.  If you want, you can state the expansion cards you use, and I'll ponder them.... but it is highly unlikely you need any shadowing at all.  If you did, you would already know about it.<br />
<br />
If you are in you BIOS and have questions about other settings, post the exact setting description and option that is set, and I can probably tell you about it.</div></div><hr />

    * Windows should use Netscape 6 to open these file types: Select the file types that you want to open by default using Netscape (HTML, JPEG, GIF, PNG, XML, XUL).<br />

but I wouldn't know where to get all the info required <br />
Most of it is in the Motherboard manual.  You need to look in the manual to find out where they stamp the Motherboard revision.  On my Motherboard, it is stamped between the #3 &amp; #4 PCI slots.<br />
<br />
The software infor can be labroisuly obtained by using Control Panel --&gt; System, and plowing through the hardware list.  For the Video Driver, right click on the desktop, and choose &quot;Properties&quot;, then select one of the nVidia tabs in the popup video properties window, and look at the driver revision (assuming you have an nVidia card).  The names may be different for other chip sets.<br />

<br />
Do you know if your bios is &quot;Award&quot; , or &quot;MR&quot; or &quot;AMI&quot; or what it's called?<br />
<br />
<br />
The way it works is this.  A company, anyone, writes a BIOS.  The basic bios is then adapted specifically for each motherboard.  Things like Chipset, sound, etc. add/subtract features.  It is possible that your specific MoBo Mfgr decided that shadowing is so obsolete that they simply no longer maintain it in their bios revisions.  Almost no one need shadowing anymore.  You don't, for sure.  <br />
<br />
You were able to look at several different pages of bios setup, right?<br />
<br />
Typically, they have names like (these are Award BIOS for an ASUS Socket 7 Motherboard, but common to most Award BIOS):<br />
<br />
Standard CMOS<br />
BIOS Features Setup<br />
Chipset Features Setup<br />
Power Management Setup<br />
PNP &amp; PCI Setup<br />
Load BIOS Defaults<br />
Load Setup Options<br />

If you don't see it there, don't worry about it.<br />

Here is the most important thing.  If teh error returns, or any error returns, you must get all that good info like you did before, even the gobbledy gook.  If it happens once or twice more, that stuff will actually tell the tale... for better or for worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At this point, my question is an easy one.  <br />
<br />
1.  Have you moved your case, or re-oriented it relative to exit airflow, or maybe next to an extrenal fan or airconditioning duct.<br />
<br />
2.  Can you determine the temperature inside your case.<br />
<br />
3.  Can you determine the temperature of your CPU.<br />
<br />
4.  Is there a temperature variation in the room where the computer is run (e.g, more than about 5 degrees or so)?<br />
<br />
<br />

Every chunk of silicon has a limit on op temp, before errors begin to propogate.  The exact way this happens, I will not get into.  Chips are as unique as humans, though... all have individual weaknesses that cannot be seen at normal temps.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have run many chips and cpus to and past the brink, and it is possible you had a temperature related failure.  Those are elusive, and much more frequent in summer months, especially here in the northwest where most of us have no air conditioning.  I have megabytes of logs going back years on my machines, and my CPUs (very well cooled) hit about 39-41 C in the winter, and as much as 51 in the summer.  Much past 58 and they get squirrelly when I run special programs that detect the onset of chip errors.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my guess at this point is its temp related.   Which is good news, as that is controllable.<br />
<br />
If you can't monitor your temp, tehn just be sure you have an excellent chip heat sink/cooler.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS, I use MBM  (Motherboard Monitor) to keep track of all my fan speeds, temps, history, and even a lot of motherboard settings.<br />
