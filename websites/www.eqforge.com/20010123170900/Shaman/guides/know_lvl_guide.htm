                  <p>Shamans, more than any other class, seem to have the greatest 
                    diversity in the way they have to play as they advance. Here 
                    is an overview of how I've played through level 28.</p>
                  <p> <font color="#333366" size="3"><b>Levels 1-4 </b></font></p>
                  <p>Start building up a bit of cash. Buy or make patchwork armor 
                    for yourself. Get a rusty warhammer or worn staff as soon 
                    as you can, as that club you start off with is horrid. Since 
                    cash will be tight, buy Burst of Flame and Strengthen before 
                    your other spells.</p>
                  <p>At this point, you're almost as good as a fighter at melee. 
                    Keep yourself and everyone else in strengthen and inner fire. 
                    Your mana is best used for healing in and out of combat. Burst 
                    of flame can be used to kill off fleeing critters, and to 
                    lure.</p>
                  <p>I found grouping even at level 1 to be very enjoyable. I 
                    managed to hook up with 2 fighters were taking on a hoard 
                    of creatures, and we got to level 4 extremely quickly.</p>
                  <p> <font size="3"><b><font color="#333366">Levels 5-8 </font></b></font></p>
                  <p>If you haven't gotten yourself a good weapon by now, do so. 
                    If you're lucky, you might be able to buy a Fine Steel 2H 
                    staff, or Fine Steel Warhammer. Buy Frost Rift, Summon Water, 
                    and Gate first. At level 8 be sure to get meditate, it raises 
                    quickly. On that same trip, if you can afford them, buy Spirit 
                    of the Wolf and Light Healing too.</p>
                  <p>You're still a decent melee fighter at this point, but now 
                    you have a good amount of mana too. Keep your tanks buffed 
                    with Strengthen, Inner Fire, and Feet Like Cat, and keep any 
                    mages buffed with Dexterous Aura.</p>
                  <p>In a group, using Frost Rift to finish off running opponents 
                    works really well, and is indispensable when those critters 
                    form trains (BlackBurrow). Your healing spell will start to 
                    feel innefective during combat.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <b><font color="#333366" size="3">Levels 9-13</font></b></p>
                  <p> Buy Spirit of the Wolf and Light Healing first. In fact, 
                    buy them before you level and scribe them as soon as you do! 
                    The other best spells include Summoned Food, Tainted Breath, 
                    and if you're a Barbarian, Serpent Sight.With Light healing 
                    you can effectively heal in combat again, and this will become 
                    your primary role. Tainted Breath is a great damage spell 
                    for long fights, if you have a fighter who can get the critter 
                    off you. </p>
                  <p>Unfortunately your instant damage spell is pretty inneffectual. 
                    You'll also notice that you're not nearly as good at melee 
                    as the fighters in damage dealing now, but you can still help 
                    them out, and take some damage. </p>
                  <p>Keep everyone buffed with wolf constantly, mages with dex, 
                    fighters with just about everything else, and yourself with 
                    everything. Serpent Sight is nice to cast on your puller at 
                    night if he doesn't have infravision.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <font size="3"><b><font color="#333366">Levels 14-18</font></b></font></p>
                  <p> Buy Spirit Strike, Walking Sleep, and Turtle Skin, first. 
                    You should also be getting yourself in a set of banded, if 
                    you haven't already. Look into getting a magic weapon such 
                    as a Runed Totem Staff, Glowing Crook, or Screaming Mace.</p>
                  <p>Walking Sleep is a great debuff. If grouped with a fighter, 
                    this can make both your lives a lot easier as you watch the 
                    mob fight in slow motion. Your healing spell will start to 
                    feel inneffectual, but in its place, you have Spirit Strike, 
                    an impressive direct damage spell.</p>
                  <p>In groups you will find you're spending an incredible amount 
                    of mana on buffs, especially on melee types. But don't be 
                    stingy. You're buffs in many cases are keeping everyone alive. 
                    A good buffing strategy is to buff yourself with something 
                    first, then buff everyone else who's appropriate with it. 
                    When it wears of you, it will be wearing off<br>
                    everyone else, and it's time to rebuff again. This also minimises 
                    the amount of re-memorization you have to do with buffs. I 
                    call this buffing a &quot;round&quot; of something.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <font color="#333366"><b><font size="3">Levels 19-23</font></b></font></p>
                  <p> The best spells are Healing, Malise, and Endure Magic. However, 
                    since by this point you will likely be fighting a ways away 
                    from your hometown, it might be better to just save up and 
                    buy all your spells at once. Start collecting magical items 
                    that enhance your wisdom, charisma, or resistances. Look into 
                    getting a bigger melee weapon such as an Ogre War Maul.</p>
                  <p>Again, you're a combat healer. Your direct damage spell is 
                    still pretty good though. Endure magic is wonderful in helping 
                    to prevent members of your group from being rooted or charmed, 
                    and helps you to resist many damaging spells as well. Malise 
                    can help casters in your party to get damage through much 
                    more often to yellow and red creatures, and should not be 
                    underestimated.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <font size="3" color="#333366"><b>Levels 24-28</b></font></p>
                  <p> Tons of great spells at this level. The best ones being 
                    Cannibalize, Regeneration, Frost Strike, and Evenomed Breath. 
                    Keep collecting more magic items to upgrade your collection.</p>
                  <p>Regenerate is most useful on yourself, since you can use 
                    Cannibalize to prevent any &quot;spillage&quot;. Regnerate 
                    constantly. Cannibalize is nice for regaining mana faster 
                    while regenerating, as well as to get that extra<br>
                    bit of mana you need to deal a final Frost Strike. One cute 
                    trick, if grouped with a cleric, he can effectively &quot;give&quot; 
                    you mana if you Cannibalize down to 1 bar of health, then 
                    he can cast Greater Heal on you. Outdoors, Spirit of the Cheetah 
                    is a nice escape spell. It lasts about 45 seconds, and will 
                    extremely quickly get you away from<br>
                    anything. It takes a while to recharge, but Zoning will do 
                    this instantly. Kiting is much easier at Level 24, since you 
                    can gain life while running away, then stop for a second convert 
                    that life into mana.</p>
                  <p> You also have Envenomed Breath, a powerful DoT spell. If 
                    kiting, make sure you save a bar of mana for regeneration 
                    though, it leaves quickly.</p>
                  <p>Regenerate is the most efficient healing you have. It takes 
                    a while, but if you're low on mana, and your melee guy is 
                    low on HP, stick regen on him while you meditate. With a bit 
                    of luck, he'll still be regennerating during your next fight 
                    too. Your buffs, as always, keep getting bigger, more powerful, 
                    and more expensive. Fortunately they<br>
                    last longer too. I traditionally keep myself in 10 buffs (5 
                    stat buffs, 2 armor buffs, Endure Magic, Regeneration, Spirit 
                    of the Wolf)</p>
