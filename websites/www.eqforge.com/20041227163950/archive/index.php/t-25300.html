Sorry for the geocities, my web site is not complete yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2002, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting. I have noticed that when I make a page with Word it does something similar to this but the image is not downloadable at all. Example: www.palehorse76.com<br />
That is a page that I did with Word 9. I don't want it to do that as I don't care if someone downloads the image, but it shows up as default.</div></div><hr />

Now, I know that for me to view that picture it has to be downloaded to my computer. If I wanted it bad enough I could search through one of my internet folders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pillager</div><div class="date">Jun 21, 2002, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Could you not just press PrintScreen, copy into a paint programme, and then save?<br />

Or,<br />

It's like when you printscreen a playing .mpg movie it will just look black.</div></div><hr />

On PH's website that image is /index_files/image001.jpg. Good point Lovro, I didn't think of that, thanks. I had someone ask me how they could get that pic from me. I had no idea and had to find it on a different page for them :)<br />

Seems the source is more than one screen long. I just thought it was hidden in something css.</div></div><hr />
