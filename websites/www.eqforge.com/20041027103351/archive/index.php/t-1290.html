<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreadnought</div><div class="date">Feb 23, 2001, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 'm trying to design a new WWII scenario, but i don't like any of the maps i have access to. <br />
<br />
I need someone to give a Europe map that has only a small protion of Africa, NO India, and less Russia. I have played all the scenarios alreaddy and i don't like the maps for what i'm trying to do.<br />
<br />
Don't question me! I know what i'm trying to do!<br />
<br />
I want more room for English , German and French Cities and less room for Russian cities.  You can make russia too powerful anyway.<br />
<br />
I need canada/U.S. but only enought room for say 3/4 cities.<br />
<br />
So if anyone is looking to help out, and needs a challenge feel free. I have tried and tried but haven't  had any luck.</div></div><hr />
