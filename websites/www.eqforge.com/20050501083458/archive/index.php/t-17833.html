<br />
Earliest Cultural Victory<br />
Earliest Conquest Victory<br />
Earliest Spaceship Launch<br />
Earliest Domination Victory<br />
Earliest Diplomatic Victory<br />
Earliest Histograph Victory (haha, j/k)<br />
<br />
Perhaps Cultural Victories should be split up into 20k in one city and 100k victories as well.  Often the two types of victories end up playing out quite differently.<br />
<br />
There is already a fastest finish, but that will almost always go to an early conquest or domination.  There really is no way for the other victory conditions to finish quickest.  I think the earliest victory of each type is often the best played one.<br />
<br />
This has been discussed a few times in various threads already, but has a decision been made on whether these victory conditions should be added to the GOTM competition?  I think I recall Thunderfall saying that they could be added if that was what the participants wanted.  So I guess the best way to decide that is a poll...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trash</div><div class="date">Mar 05, 2002, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be good to have the extra by date conditions to give people an 'honourable' out so to speak, for the people that don't want to hang around making everything perfect till 2050.<br />
<br />
I'd say probably keep the cultural victories together. Just because it's a fairly rare victory condition as it is, the requirements to win by the too type aren't that different, both 'require' building early cultural improvements. <br />
When people win by a 80,000 point cultural victory their capital (wonder building city) will more often than not make up a good 12-20,000 points of it. And when i won my last GOTM with a 20,000 point city win, I had over 100,000 points in total but because i'd lead a peaceful relationalship with India in particular so they had about 120,000 points of culture themselves.<br />
<br />
Only downside to the extra awards would be an a absolute mess on the Hall Of Fame page :)</div></div><hr />

Victory Condition's to be added to the GOTM<br />
<br />
Earliest Cultural Victory<br />
Earliest Conquest Victory<br />
Earliest Spaceship Launch<br />
Earliest Domination Victory<br />
Earliest Diplomatic Victory<br />
Earliest Histograph Victory (haha, j/k)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that some of the suggested conditions are<br />
good, but not all, and some of the current victory<br />
conditions are not that good at all. Here's<br />
classification of separate awards from my point of view:<br />
<br />
- Earliest Domination or Conquest victory (no point in separating them, the strategy will be the very similar anyway)<br />
<br />
- Earliest Cultural victory (this one usually takes more<br />
time so it shouldn't be mixed with others)<br />
<br />
- Earliest Diplomatic victory<br />
<br />
- Earliest spaceship victory<br />
<br />
- Highest score for non-conquest and non-domination victory (this is one is a challenge on the building of perfect empire)<br />
<br />
- Diplomatic or spaceship victory with lowest score!!!<br />
(test your diplomatic and management skills) - half-serious proposal.<br />
<br />
No other awards.<br />
<br />
I can also see another separate contest - &quot;Survival challenge&quot;.<br />
<br />
Let's say every week there's a Deity game on tiny map <br />
(to reduce time requirements) with poor starting location. Submission time can be about 3-4 for weeks,<br />
so people can play when they have time. Each victory<br />
scores 4 points (type of victory and victory date don't matter), survival until 1700 AD scores 1 point (date is approximate, idea of this is to encourage submissions of lost games).<br />

It takes time to do achive of these so maybe we should give people an award woho can speed up the process.:) :) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirPleb</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2002, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like the idea of earliest conquest, domination, spaceship, conquest, and diplomatic win prizes.<br />
<br />
It does seem important to me to separate earliest conquest and domination. On most maps I expect that conquest would be the earliest possible, domination requires a slightly different approach and is, I think, a different kind of win.<br />
<br />
At first I thought having the two ways to get cultural wins separate would be best. Much depends on the map. On a large/hard map, with many Civs, the single city cultural win could be much more difficult than the total culture win. But on reflection I think the distinction is too subtle, seems best to me to treat them as a single condition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirPleb</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2002, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding the number of medals getting out of hand:<br />
<br />
There are already three prizes for the top scores. To make some room, might it be best to remove the medals for highest score per victory condition, and use those medals for the earliest date per condition instead?<br />
<br />
If I remember right, out of the last 3 GOTMs 8 of the 9 top scores were very late dates, essentially milked games. In the high scoring games I have played, I could always have chosen any of retirement, spaceship, domination, conquest, or cultural victories. I do tend to go for a different one each time but that's just because I want more nice icons beside my name :) It isn't because they need a different way of playing. In milked games I've played, the only case which creates a unique challenge as I see it is a diplomatic win, the others are essentially the same. (I've been planning on a milked diplomatic one of these months but, although difficult and interesting, it is perhaps too special a case and therefore not worthy of a prize.) <br />
<br />
So, perhaps the distinction of highest score by victory condition is not all that important - there could just be the prizes for the three highest, regardless of victory condition. Earliest date is a very different matter. Each victory condition requires a different approach when going for it. So the medals could be used for that.<br />
<br />
If this thought meets with general approval then I guess there will be some medals disappearing from the current board. I'd lose some :sad: but I think it would make sense. I didn't really earn the specific victory conditions listed, I just went for a high score, it would be fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2002, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with SirPleb about the &quot;milked&quot; victories not really needing to have seperate awards.  I thought about suggesting that they be combined when I posted this, but since I don't have any of the awards to take away (hopefully someday! i picked the same victory condition this month as SirPleb though... uh oh) I didn't feel comfortable with bringing it up.  They wouldn't have to be taken away though.  <br />

<br />
The awards definitely change the way some people play.  Many of the milked games that have been played could have won the &quot;earliest&quot; conditions if that had been the goal.  If the earliest date had been what you were shooting for SirPleb, I think you had at least one game where that was accomplished, just you played it out to 2050.  DirtyClint's GOTM2 falls into that category as well (IIRC his conquest was finished at very close to the same time as Airness'), and I'm sure there are others.  There have also been some early finishes in each category that have been submitted that may have still won, even if the milked games hadn't been milked.  It would be impossible to tell who played previous GOTM's best by date, because that's not what everyone was shooting for.  The target can be changed, but let people keep their past accomplishments.<br />
<br />
I do think that Date is less defining than Score for Diplomatic victories though.  It is quite difficult to maximize score while still keeping enough AI around to vote for you.  It is also possible to just stay out of world affairs for the most part and build the UN to win, which isn't much of a test of skill.  Perhaps it could be kept as it is.  We would have Earliest Conquest, Domination, Cultural, and Space Launch victories along with highest overall score, and a highest Diplomatic score.  This would actually cut down the number of awards by one.  The fastest finish award would essentially become the earliest Conquest one.</div></div><hr />

I like that! Leave the Diplomatic medal to be by score, the other victory condition medals by date. Quite logical - milking a Diplomatic win actually makes it harder, getting any of the other wins sooner makes them harder. Keep the gold/silver/bronze purely score based as now, right? It would still sometimes be possible to get a trophy and a medal in the same game but it would happen less often than now.<br />
<br />
Sounds like that's two votes for this approach so far :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2002, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it would add an interesting side competition between the Global Rankings and HOF standings.  Since the Global Rankings are based on 3 of the last 5 scores, it would be up to the player to figure out which maps offer the best chance for a medal or victory award, while still keeping in the Global Rankings hunt.  We could end up with Rankings and Awards specialist (not to mention the jack-of-all-trades types)... adds to the depth of the competition.</div></div><hr />

This is also a good idea. More highlights.<br />
<br />
But as I've stated in the news post I'm working on some more stuff to add and changes to make to the GOTM pages. As some of you might know I make lots of statistics in the Excel file. First of all I want some of those on the GOTM pages itself. Secondly I want to highlight more things, like fastest victories. But I don't think I will award them. :o<br />
<br />
I know it sounds a bit vague, but that's also because I don't know myself what I wanna do yet. But a lot more fun things can be done! I do know that. ;)</div></div><hr />

You could highlight the highest scores for each kind, but only give medals for fastest finishers.

<br />
But after last GOTM and what i'm faced with doing for the last 280 turns of the game this month. I think i've begun to change my mind. I think i'd be alot more happy to race for tech and build a quick spaceship from this point and finish with an above average score than to build aqueduct, marketplace, hospital, cathedral the 100 odd cities wait till 2050 and finish with a toppish score</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will be better for all. Those who want to get in the upper ranks in the global ranking will milk their games as always. But for all other players it is a very good way to end a game early without the feeling that all their efforts won´t be seen because they will be listed in the middle of the ranking (look at my GotM2 - Space victory in ~1700AD).<br />
<br />
So Matrix please give it a try.<br />

<br />
I can change the awards from highest score per victory to fastest finish. That's should actually make the histographic victory obscolete. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Another question: should it be retroactive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 11, 2002, 03:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think past awards should be kept.  The players who have them earned them.  Everyone knew what the victory conditions were, and those who played best were the ones who won them.  They don't mean the same thing with the conditions changed, but it does still show who played best.  The earliest victories shouldn't be awarded retroactively though, because thats not what the goal of the competition was at the time.<br />
<br />
Diplomatic should still be judged by score.  That is because it is much harder to keep the AI happy while racking up the points (conquering territory) than it is to just sit back and try to inflate the tech rate as much as possible.  To get a Diplomatic victory you have to allow at least 2 AI to live, and make sure that one of them likes you enough to vote for you.  This keeps people from conquering the world and then building up to a Diplomatic win, or at least makes it much harder to do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ProPain</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2002, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've milked a game for the first time this month. I had only one egyptian city left on march the 5th and had fun till then. I decided to milk the last 125 years or so to optimize my score. I finished the game today (12th of march) and got really bored.:sleep:<br />
<br />
So I'm in favor for the earliest finish solution but I see one problem. People who go for an early finish will never win the GOTM unless they try a domination/conquest victory in the BC's. <br />
<br />
So I thought of the following solution. Let's add a bonus to the score to everyone who finishes before 2050. This bonus should be the average point increase of the last 5 turns * number of remaining turns and subtract the civ3 bonus <br />
of (2050-end date)*lvl.<br />
<br />
This way everyone's score will approximate the score they would have had, had they decided to milk the game. People who like to milk a game can still do so and squeeze out those points you won't get using this formula.<br />
<br />
This way everyone has an even chance to win but can still play their own style. <br />
<br />
Major drawback: It will be very time consuming to calculate everyone's score. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2002, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Adding a bonus like that would be easily exploited.  By limiting growth while you build up a large reserve of workers and settlers, you could cause a huge score boom for 5 turns right before the victory condition was achieved.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's too much of a problem that the high scores and awards will be harder to achieve at the same time.  People who want to score high still have the medals and diplomatic victorys to shoot for, and people who want to maximize efficiency to obtain a victory condition quickest have that option as well.</div></div><hr />

Let's add a bonus to the score to everyone who finishes before 2050. This bonus should beThe game's scoring formula is certainly flawed. But I don't think there is any easy fix. The formula you suggest could be exploited as Aeson points out. Even if not exploited it would still have imbalances. For a very early conquest it would project too low a score. For a carefully arranged later conquest it could result in a much higher score than a milked game. (Because after a certain point during milking, the score increase/turn decreases for the remainder of the game.) The only accurate projection I know of so far requires that the game be already milked to the point where territory and happiness are no longer changing. At that point you can project the final score. (See http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=17550 for a calculator which does that projection.)<br />
<br />
In the long run we may well want a modified scoring system. The best starting point for a modified scoring system which I've seen is Aeson's Jan 1 post on this thread: http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=10682&amp;perpage=20&amp;pagenumber=9<br />
It sure is complicated to fine tune that kind of approach though. Map size, percentage of water, and victory type must all be factors in balancing early win dates. I've also started thinking that a bonus would be better based on number of turns remaining than on year. The current bonus system is non-linear and rewards very early wins out of proportion. Higher multipliers (somewhere between 5 and 10 I would guess) applied to turns could work better than the program's multiplier of 1 applied to dates.<br />
<br />
At any rate, one step at a time I think. :) Though we may not have a formula to compare wins of different types, it is clear that the earliest win of each type is special. So a change to reward the earliest wins seems like a good move. Beyond that doesn't seem clear yet, so it seems best to stay with the game's scoring formula for the trophies until a better scoring system becomes clear. Maybe one day it will, especially once we have some game history with early wins by victory type to analyze...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm very charmed by the mechanics of Aeson's system since it's more exploit-proof but it should be based on turns instead of years. I think it's really worth some more testing with gotm scores to fine tune it because one system to grade all victory conditions would be great!<br />
<br />
For now I'm in favor of changing the medals to earliest date. It will for sure renew my enthousiasm for the gotm cuz the milking is certainly not my cup of tea.<br />

Perhaps Firaxis should square root the histographic score, like I did with the Civ2 score for calculating the GOTM score there. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

It's why my HOF submission wasn't included.  All you have to do is either time the building of the UN so you can vote on 2050 and vote for your opponent, or just give away all your cities but the capitol, and disband that by building a Settler</div></div><hr />

Ooo, good point! Suggestion retracted.</div></div><hr />

If I would have had a cultural victory in 1500AD, I would get a medal instead of SirPleb? Under these conditions, I would have a medal for GOTM5 for quickest domination victory, small prize for a lower score.<br />
<br />
Just my current view, next month if I get the quickest domination victory I want a medal! But I'll know I lost on points and therefore lower overall rating. Rating, in the long run will be more important, medals will lose their shine.  Let's put some shine back on the medals.<br />

I think it adds more luster to the medals, because people will have to actually work towards that victory condition to win it, instead of just having one &quot;added on&quot; to their medal.  There will also be maps where a quick victory scores high enough to help ratings.  <br />
<br />
In GOTM05 Lucky earned a medal without milking his score.  Those types of opportunities should be more common with many of the players trying to finish quickly.  Milking the best score at 2050 takes skill, but it isn't the only way to play a &quot;good&quot; game.</div></div><hr />
