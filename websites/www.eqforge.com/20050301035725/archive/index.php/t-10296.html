<br />
I haven't bought this game yet, but I was wondering, is there a way to stop all tech advancement after Ancient...  So if I wanted to play a game limited to the Ancient 'world' could I?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
First and easy way would be to edit a tech into the Ancient Era and make it required to leave the Ancient Era, but make it have a prerequisite that isn't available.  I'm just not positive that you can add a tech to an era.<br />
<br />
Second would be to edit all of the Middle Ages techs so that their prerequisites were unavailable...there's one issue with this though, a scientific nation is going to pick up one tech for free as soon as it finishes the AE tech tree...you might have to modify Monotheism and remove any attributes that it has...since Monotheism is the tech that is always handed out 'randomly'.<br />
<br />
There are probably easier ways of doing this, try asking in the MOD forum...</div></div><hr />
