A Barb. King is the Barb. Diplomat.  The Guy you kill to get money after the barbs attack.<br />
<br />
If you bribe a barb king you get a diplomat!  It's pretty cool.<br />

Which one whould you choose, 150 Gold or a diplomat?  http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif I think barbarians are saviors. They are easy to kill and allow me to run budget deficits for long period of time. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/biggrin.gif</div></div><hr />

I hate barbarians! On the current high score game I'm working on, I'm in a utopian world, with perfect science, taxes, and a steady growth and colonization. The barbarian partisans come by, and destroyed the trans-mountain railway which took me like 300 years with 80,000 people to build!! Then they fortified everywhere and killed about 10 of my engineers. Ofcourse, I bombarded them with my reserve battleships, but I had to rebuild the roads and railroads, while diverting my farmlandbuilding engineers.<br />
<br />
How can you like barbarians, TF???????????</div></div><hr />

Yeah but bribing barb kings is cheaper than rush building a diplomat and I try to avoid building non-improvments/military units (EX. WoW, diplo/spies/caravan/, etc...) and it's only 150 on raging hordes.  On &quot;villages only&quot; it 50 so http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/tongue.gif<br />
<br />
(Now I know your saying.....&quot;How can he bribe a barb king if he doesn't build diplomats???&quot;  Well I always try to have at least 1 diplomat for emergicies.)<br />

Normally I play with them as point neutral, mostly because I don't want them around when I play, only among my opponent’s cities.<br />
<br />
BTW Vlad, which record are you aiming at?? Not one of mine I hope....<br />

<br />
I get veteran units when they attack!<br />
<br />
I get free 150 every time I run down one of their leaders<br />
<br />
Sometimes, they show up in just the right spot and I can bribe them to get a unit where I would never have been able to get one in such a short amount of time!<br />
<br />
And for those that have difficulty defending against them...<br />
<br />
BUILT A BLOODY DEFENCE!!! sheeesh, (excuse the language).<br />
<br />
If you build one phalanx in all your cities at the start, 9 times out of ten the barbs lose, even if say two archers attck one phalanx.<br />
<br />
 Yeah, they might take a city, but sheeeesh, you can buy it back for 50!!!<br />
<br />
And if they take a city that costs more to buy back, give up CIV!<br />

Shadowdale, I'm only aiming for King, because I'm not quite good enough for anything higher yet, so you don't have to worry.</div></div><hr />
