<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Feb 19, 2001, 01:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
I thought I would tell a little thing I've been doing with the Star Trek ideas. Some time ago I release two Star Trek modpacks, and expected to write scenarios for each one...<br />
<br />
As time went on...I got better ideas and tools to make an even better Star Trek mod...so that's what I did. Thunderfall, a while back, asked me about a Star Trek scenario and I think I said something about working on one but never got back to him about it.<br />
<br />
Well, here it is...a couple screen shots of what is to come...mind you, this is the very early stuff, compared to what I intend to do with this &quot;package&quot;. In it, I intend to include at least 5 scenarios with events using custom maps of the galaxy that I have already prepared. This scenario will be playable on Civ II Classic or higher but not ToT (sorry).<br />
<br />
Please note: This mod/scenario is meant to encompass TOS, TNG, DS9, Voyager; hence, the name 'Generations'.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just click the pic!<br />

<br />
Absolutely! I am paying special attention on this modpack (which will have scenarios in it) so that it can be played on all versions, but not ToT. I've found that not necessarily everything made for Fantastic Worlds plays on MGE because of certain files, so now I am testing everything with the Modpack Manager, FW, and MGE. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, once again to ToT players, but ToT really is the evil step child of Civ II. I can't seem to do as much with it. As soon as I figure a way around the code in ToT...I expect to build some kind of mod/scenarios for ToT.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good question.<br />
<br />

<br />
With regard to mod packs, if they contain scenarios, I generally just treat the modpack as a scenario. Its hassel free and almost as good as the real thing. The main things you lose are:<br />
<br />
1. the pulldown menu terms <br />
2. the starting screens/music when you load the civ<br />
3. City screen (but you can compensate manually for this)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alcibiaties of Athenae</div><div class="date">Feb 19, 2001, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It looks quite interesting. Will it run with MGE? I've had problems with modpacs, that's why I ask.<br />

<br />
I wish that we could just get those things in a scenario...but too...there is the Classic Civ II problem...those players can't get the same scenario play with units and graphic unless they use it as a modpack. That is why I recommend the Modpack Manager to Classic Civ II users...it does the same thing for them just as Fantastic Worlds or MGE would treat scenarios...and you get everything from the Modpack and the scenario!<br />
<br />
It's so much easier to use...I still play classic civ II using the Modpack Manager..that's how good it is...<br />
