Also, say at what level of difficulty you played at, as many scenarios have a different feel at different levels.<br />

<br />
I agree, I always play once at Prince-level (the first time) and then on King or Emperor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
------------------<br />
I know it seem hard sometimes, but uh...<br />
remember one thing:<br />
through every dark night,<br />
there's a bright day after that,<br />
so no matter how hard it get, stick ya chest out<br />
keep ya head up and handle it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magnus</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2001, 10:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always play the default level - unless its below king.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2001, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't this review format a little long and strict? It's hardly a review format -more of a checklist! -I would agree with Willem (in the other thread), that reviews always are subjective. Wouldn't it be more useful for players to get that one man's opinion straight away, in one short paragraph? -complimented with some other players opinions?<br />
<br />
-Like &quot;I think the units are rubbish, but the techs are designed very well, and it actually is very funny...&quot; or &quot;The grapx are HUGE, and 100% historically correct, but it's a little slow to play&quot; ..or something like this? -of course with more detail the more complex the scenario is. -Not all scenario types would comply with the above format.<br />
<br />
Who are going to read a long list of scores anyway? -I suggest that the format is used as a guideline for the aspects that reviewers can take into consideration, rather than as a strict-to-follow checklist.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Jun 19, 2001, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, we can do it as this:<br />
<br />
We talk about the points, and not make it a check list. I can't explain. Just check my review I made of BeBro's Imperium Romanum. Thunderfall should post it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2001, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.........<br />
<br />
This is the official format that will likely be followed by offical reviewers here at civfanatics, I would think...which doesn't mean that those who would like to post a paragraph or short review are going to be left out...by all means send in your comments!<br />
<br />
Third party reviewers should not feel limited or tied down...use the format as a guideline so you don't forget what you wanted to say (I never thought of it as a check list actually, but I guess it could be).<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I think longer reviews help those who want to play a new scenario (especially longer scenarios) and anyone who wants to know more about what to expect. Also, I've read reviews after playing a scenario and understood the scenario better because some useful piece of information was missed during the game. I think good reviews &quot;help&quot; players get a better idea of what the author achieved. <br />
<br />
Reviews are also in some way a tribute to the author's success or attempt. A short review is always welcome, longer reviews simply offer more. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SunTzu</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2001, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well i have a problem with the review format. It is a bit too confusing. We have a total of 30 points to give a scenario.....<br />
<br />
There's 37 things taht we score on but the points i a possible x/30 <br />
what is the ammount of points for each of the little scores?<br />
I think we should do a small scoring system.<br />
Playability:x/5<br />
Would you replay the scenario:x/1<br />
Art Work:x/5<br />
New Art Work or borrowed?:x/1<br />
Sounds:x/5<br />
Are the sounds clear and go with the appropriate unit?:x/1<br />
Historical Accuracy(Historic scenarios only):x/5<br />
Is the number of events files suffecient?:x/1<br />
General Care:x/5<br />
Do you suggest this scenario to others?:x/1  <br />
Totally a possible 30/30 points.<br />
Also after each score give a description of why you gave that score and give overall comments at the end, with the addition of 3rd party comments.<br />
But really, what does 'Did you finish the scenario' have to do with scoring, even if someone doesn't finish Nemo's Second Front scenario doesn't mean they should take off 3points from the score.<br />
Just inputting my opinion.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Jun 27, 2001, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The first line of the instruction explains-You are supposed to answer only 5 questions of your choice from each section.<br />
<br />
5x6 sections = 30 points.<br />
<br />
You are also allowed to answer less than five if you pro-rate the score for the relevant section and you can also ask any number of additional questions at the bottom and assign points to those. So I think that you can adjust the format to suit your preferences under the current arrangement.<br />
