<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Adebisi</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2002, 04:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have this virus on my computer.<br />
http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/w32.yaha.f@mm.html<br />
<br />
It stops any attempt to use anti-virus software or firewalls. I can't remove it that way. It occasionally slows down my computer so much that I cant use it. Therefore I will have to remove it.<br />
<br />
It's in the folder C:\recycled. It doesn't show up in the recycled bin but it does in the folder itself. I cant delete it because it is &quot;in use by windows&quot;. I tried to go into dos but it didn't look like the file was there at all when I went that way.<br />
<br />
Is there  a way to delete the file from DOS?<br />
<br />
Also, does anyone know any other way to get rid of it?<br />
<br />
I have Windows 98 (not SE).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Procedure:<br />
<br />
1.  Boot into DOS mode (do not boot to Windoze) <br />
<br />
2. Use a non-inflected floppy to boot, if at all possible (BORROW one, if you have to) !!!<br />
<br />
3.  Change to the c: drive, type:<br />
c:<br />
<br />
4.  To see the recyled directory , type:<br />
dir /ah /p /v<br />
<br />
5. Change to the recycled directory:<br />
cd recycled<br />
<br />
6.  See what is in the directory:<br />
dir /ah /p /v<br />
<br />
7.  Decide what you wanna kill.<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.com/uploads/CFC_recycled_delete.gif<br />
<br />
8.  To delete, you need the attrib command (use &quot;attrib /?&quot; for help); start with:<br />
attrib<br />
<br />
9. To the left of the filename will be one or more of the following letters RASHD.  Lets get the ones that matter -  type:<br />
<br />
attrib -r -s -h FILENAME.TXT<br />
<br />
(Obviously, you change FILENAME.TXT to the file you are after!)<br />
<br />
<br />
10.  Now do a plain dir command:<br />
dir<br />
<br />
11.  You should now see the file you wanna delete - type:<br />
del FILENAME.TXT<br />
<br />
12.  File should be gone.<br />
<br />
13.  Repeat for any other files you want gone.<br />
<br />

I did as you told, deleted the virus, booted into windows. I noticed I couldn't run exefiles (as the virus had set itself to run all exefiles). So I followed the instructions in the link I posted above.<br />
<br />
No more problems!<br />
<br />
Again, thanks!</div></div><hr />

I solved the problem by reinstalling windows! (I needed to do it anyways so why not just wipe the virus out the easy way). :D</div></div><hr />

That virus is a new one, BTW!  <br />

Glad to help :).</div></div><hr />

Windows reinstalls are a pain for me.  Do you use a Utilites Suite?  If not, I recommend Fix It 4.0 for someone who is pretty good with computers like you.  Among other things, it will back  up, compress, and restore your Registry.  With a virus scanner &amp; a safe copy of your registry, you can usually restore your OS with no worries!  Also, backin up your registry before trying DL programs is a good way to restore your registry, including keeping it compact (e.g., greatly reduces registry fragmentation when you unistall programs).</div></div><hr />

[B]Ah, I got hit by that one also, my first virus in over 10 years of computing! Good ratio for all the programs I DL. :)Seems like many people are getting it. <br />
<br />
Myself, I was stupid. I have gotten hundreds of viruses by mail but never installed them, but this one seems to come from a friend and without thinking I opened the attachment.<br />
<br />
But some people who also got it (many people I know since it spreads by contact list) say it &quot;just got onto my computer somehow&quot;. Seems to be a nasty one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2002, 05:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got an email from an unknown person. The file looked to be a .gif file...the way Outlook Express showed the file was what made it look that way. The file real was named:<br />
 &quot;picture.gif                                                                   .scr&quot;. there was an absurd amount of spaces between the .gif and the .scr. Well I tried to open it instead of saving it to disk first. When nothing happened I got suspicious. I then saved it to my desktop and that is when I slapped my head. Oh well, learned something new and since I needed to reinstall windows because I setup my partitions incorrectly I was not too worried.<br />
<br />
On backing up the registry: The reason I reload windows is to get rid of the bloated registry! Why would I want to back it up? ;)<br />
<br />
I will look into Fix It 4.0, sounds interesting.</div></div><hr />

Fix It 4.0 will also compress the registry.  you back up the registry so you can restore it if a program messes it up, does not uninstall correctly (a common occurrance), etc.   This saves a window re-install.<br />
<br />
Properly done, install/unistalls will not affect the registry size very much, after compression to remove the gaps caused by deleted entries.  Restoring a backed up registry after an install/uninstall will revert the registry back to it original size, BTW.</div></div><hr />
