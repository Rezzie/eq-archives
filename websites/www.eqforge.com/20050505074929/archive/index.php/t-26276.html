I'm not so crazy about jumping into this month's Emperor game, so I figure I'll dig in the archives and compare my score against the final result.<br />
<br />
Given that....the question:  Which one was your favorite?  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jul 01, 2002, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Deity one!!! :yeah:<br />
Definitely the most interesting, most fun and greatest game of Civ3 I played so far, with real suspense in each turn to the end.<br />
<br />
Closely followed by the first Emperor game as the English.<br />
<br />
But the Germans are great, too.<br />
:D<br />
<br />
P.S.: IIRC this months GOTM is on Emperor level, not Monarch. So your number 9 is incorrect. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Jul 01, 2002, 06:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Defenitly 7!  The mosy challenging, and enjoying GOM for me yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jul 01, 2002, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Although it is my first time playing GOTM. Since it is hard for me to decide (On the poll) of the favorite GOTM. I have started playing it today. I have decided based on the Barbarian activity (On personal games I usualy have them at the highest active level.) &quot;Civ Barbarians&quot; bring them on&quot; :D :ripper: :ninja:.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sullla</div><div class="date">Jul 01, 2002, 08:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GOTM5 was awesome; in many ways it was more difficult for me than GOTM7's Deity challenge. I've never been so close to defeat only to pull out an improbable win from behind as I was in that game. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Matrix</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2002, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice poll, SirJethro. ;) Only this GOTM is emperor, not monarch, so I changed it.<br />
<br />
My favorite is actually the current one. The previous one as Germans was also fun, but definitely not the deity game! :eek: That's just impossible. I was too small and it was simlpy waiting for another Civ to launch the space ship.<br />
<br />
The GOTM 1, 2, 3 and 5 went terribly for me. And 4 and 6 had a too obvious destiny; there was no way to go to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirJethro</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2002, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something I didn't consider......the archive games don't start using patch 1.21f until the 6th or 7th game.  Does that mean they won't load with the latest patch?  <br />
<br />
I definatley don't plan on stepping my version back to the Dark Ages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jove</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2002, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">GOTMVII, definitely. It honed my CivIII skills more than the others so far. But I'm looking forward to this emporer archipelago challenge!</div></div><hr />

Save games are backward compatible, you´ll have no problems loading them with the current patch. :yeah:<br />
<br />
But since the patches changed the gameplay rather drastically, it is unlikely that you can achieve similar results as in the first ones. (That doesn´t mean you will do worse. ;))<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phillip_martin</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2002, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GOTM 8 as it had several factors I enjoy in a CIV game:<br />
1. A fair chance to grow<br />
2. Constant updating of strategy (This keeps my interest)<br />
3. A stiff challenge (No early archer rushes for me)<br />
4. A brilliant snatch of victory from the jaws of defeat (albeit by nuking a stack of 60 Russian armour pieces on the mountains west of Berlin:ak47::nuke: )<br />
5. Use of all tactics (Trade/Diplomacy/war) to achieve goals.<br />
6. Excellent discussions in the forum (that includes blowing open the term &quot;gambit&quot;:eek: )<br />
7. I acheived a victory<br />
<br />
As a &quot;several hours every now and then&quot; player I tend to lose interest after the middle ages as the games variations and surprises die down. <br />
<br />
Not in the last game.:king:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scientia</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2002, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext"># 8<br />
<br />
I got off to a slow start, expanding into the jungle instead of towards the north where the more fertile food plains lay.  As a result, I didn't end up with enough cities to overcome the initial gap with the AI.  I was behind in tech (at one point, 8 techs behind, maybe more) the entire game, had no saltpeter, no coal, and no oil.<br />
<br />
I was lucky to squeak by with a diplomatic victory in 1788.  It was me vs. Mao in the vote, and the only vote Mao received was his own!<br />
<br />
This was my first game of Civ3 without war . . . and I even had<br />
an MPP with Russia for nearly 30 turns.  Of course later, when<br />
Japan went on a rampage, I was the only civ not involved in the war.<br />
<br />
I've only played two so far (#6, #8), but this one was by far the most fun even though I made mistakes early on in the game.  I'm still tweaking my general strategy, and this game helped out a lot in that regard.</div></div><hr />
