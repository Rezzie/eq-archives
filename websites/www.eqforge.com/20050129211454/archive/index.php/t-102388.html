It probably uses gcc for compiling. Unfortunately I cannot offer any advice besides Dev-cpp. :( Also, pretty much any compiler is going to suck up all your CPU power...not much you can do about it....the better ones will just take less time to finish compiling. You could try to get a hold of a Student version of MS Visual Studio or MS C++. There also might be a Student/Free version of Borland C++.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Free Borland C++ (http://www.borland.com/products/downloads/download_cbuilder.html)<br />
Free MS Visual C++ (http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/)<br />
I did two searches in google. One for free microsoft C++ and one for free borland C++. Google is lovely!  :)<br />
<br />
PS: You need more RAM if you are going to be compiling! I would recommend 1 GB if you can. At least 512 MB if you cannot afford to jump to 1 GB. But you really should go for 1 GB. (512 MB DDR go for about 70ish each from www.newegg.com - if you are in the states).</div></div><hr />

Dev-C++ 4.9.9.0 works! :D  I downloaded it, and my CPU is all happy.  I turned off this feature that said could take up more memory and CPU, and since then, like Comraddict said, it only takes up the CPU when compiling.<br />

a great alternative to Dev-Cpp is SharpDevelop (#develop). It is an IDE/compiler that was created for the .NET framework. It is used for C# programming. It also lets you program in VB.NET and C++. Also it includes a form designer that you can use to create applications. I say it is one of the most powerful compilers for C++ language and great alternative to Microsoft Visual C++<br />
<br />
you can download it from here:http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/<br />
<br />
once you installed it open up the program and then go to File-&gt;New-&gt;Project<br />
<br />
then a box opens and select a C++ project.</div></div><hr />

Visual C++ is sort of like a crutch, since you have the windows forms (with controls to easily add, and you don't have to worry about making your own graphics, loops, etc.) to back you up. A 100% text-based program is best for learning how to program. Then, using a GUI comes next. (I wondered this myself back in the early days of my computer science major. Granted, they were still using Win 95 and 98).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ginger_Ale</div><div class="date">Nov 17, 2004, 06:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi again, I have a question:  What is the difference between the following programs (and what do they do):  Visual Basic, Visual Basic C++, and .NET .  Thanks.<br />
<br />
Also, here's a calculator program I wrote in C++ (with the help of Chieftess to look at the code and see if there were any shortcuts - one example was using nested loops and not pasting the code over and over ;) Thanks.)  It can add, subtract, multiply, and divide, and you can do it as many times as you like.<br />
<br />
Here is the Source Code File (cpp) and Executable (exe) (http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads8/GACalculatorC++.zip)<br />
<br />
I hope you enjoy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Nov 17, 2004, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is no &quot;Visual Basic C++&quot;. You're thinking of Visual C++. ;)<br />
<br />
Visual Basic tended to be more graphical, and more &quot;in English&quot; than C++.<br />
<br />
i.e.:<br />
<br />
Visual Basic code:<br />
<br />
Public Function Add()<br />
Begin<br />
 dim a as integer<br />
 a = (1 + 5)<br />
 return a<br />
End<br />
<br />
C++:<br />
<br />
int Add()<br />
{<br />
int a = (1 + 5);<br />
return a;<br />
}<br />
<br />
It's a matter of syntax. .NET code is similar, but Visual C++ is MUCH more gui-based than Visual C++ 6 (you couldn't use the gui easily). Code is much more object-based in .NET. (a little easier to use on the GUI side, but doesn't work as smoothly with graphics .NET 2003 I've noticed. .NET 2005 Public BETA seems better).<br />
<br />
BTW - Ginger_Ale, you still haven't used nested loops. Put another while loop (with a seperate variable with the if statements inside. And cout something like &quot;Enter another equation?&quot;). That way, there's 2 loops. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ginger_Ale</div><div class="date">Nov 17, 2004, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW - Ginger_Ale, you still haven't used nested loops. Put another while loop (with a seperate variable with the if statements inside. And cout something like &quot;Enter another equation?&quot;). That way, there's 2 loops. :)<br />
<br />
And where would this go?  I have the &quot;redo cout&quot; in an if statement, so that when someone presses &quot;0 - Exit&quot; from the main menu, it will quit, and not ask to redo.  You want two while() statements then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Nov 17, 2004, 05:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here's a simple example:<br />
<br />
<br />
int done = 1;<br />
int repeat = 1;<br />
<br />
while ( done != 0 )<br />
{<br />
// This is our first loop. We're telling it to repeat until done = 0.<br />
<br />
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Select an option: (1 = do something, 0 = exit)&quot;;<br />
cin &gt;&gt; done;<br />
<br />
// We got the option (i.e., 1 is do something)<br />
<br />
while ( repeat != 0 )<br />
{<br />
// Now we keep repeating this until the user presses 0<br />
// do something.<br />
if ( done == 1 ) { /* do whatever you want */ }<br />
<br />
cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Do you want to do this task again?&quot;;<br />
cin &gt;&gt; repeat;<br />
<br />
// if it's 1, we start this inner loop over again. If 0, then we go to the outer loop.<br />
} // end of inner loop.<br />
} // end of outer loop.<br />
<br />
<br />
The output is something like this:<br />
<br />
Select an option: (1 = do something, 0 = exit)1<br />
Do you want to do this task again?1<br />
Do you want to do this task again?1<br />
Do you want to do this task again?0<br />
Select an option: (1 = do something, 0 = exit)0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ginger_Ale</div><div class="date">Nov 17, 2004, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, ok, so I could do that if I had multiple things to do.  ie;  The first while statement could be chosing between using the calculator or doing something else like a 'combat calculator'.  Then they would each have their own while statements and inside the while statements, if statements.  Right? :)<br />
<br />
About Visual Basic:  What is the difference between Visual Basic, Visual Studio, and Visual Basic .NET?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Nov 17, 2004, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Visual Basic - This is the programming language. The base for the other two things. <br />
<br />
Visual Studio - This is sort of the &quot;platform&quot; for working with Visual Basic. It might come with several different programs like Visual Basic, Visual Interdev (more web-page oriented using vbScript - similar to Javascript), and VB.NET.<br />
<br />
Visual Basic .NET - A 'better' (depends on who you ask and for what purpose) form of Visual Basic. It has more database support, and web support, too. The editor is easier to use, too.<br />
<br />
For your first question, that's essentially correct. The main while loops keeps you inside your menu. The secondary loop is to ask you if you want to repeat. <br />
<br />
You could have a 3rd loop inside your if statments if you had another level of menus or something. (sub-menus).<br />
<br />
This was common back in the DOS days. Infact, I did this (a database program for an address book) in highschool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">Nov 17, 2004, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For reference, here's the tools I use at work for Software (and Webpage) Development:<br />
<br />
Visual Studio .NET Enterprise Edition (better database and SQL Server support) - Explained above. It has Visual Basic, Visual C#, and Visual J#. What's the difference? One person said (and I quote), &quot;It's like going from gear shift (C++/J++) to automatic (C#/J#)!&quot;.<br />
SQL Server 2003 - This is the database server we're moving too (called migrating). We were using MS Access 2000. It's a more powerful SQL-based database engine.<br />
Frontpage 2003 - Personally, I cringe at the thought of this one, since I like Dreamweaver better, but the top execs want all Microsoft products. Even the new webpage editor who was hired used Dreamweaver before she got her job here. (That's the job I was offered at first).<br />
Crystal Reports - This is the report generation engine. It's used for making reports from the database.<br />
Adobe Photoshop - The standard image editor. Mostly for cropping and adjusting contrast for images for Intranet slideshows. (everyone likes the slideshows I made over the summer, now they're demanding more! It used to be 1 page with 30 images and text. Poor design.)<br />
Visual Interdev - An old Visual Basic scripting tool we used to use before moving to .NET. <br />
MS Access 2000 - Another database program that's on its' way out.</div></div><hr />

Presumably you're still at school.  You can get academic copies of these for a fraction of the cost, yet still the same functionallity.  Look into it!<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
I used to program exclusively in VB 6.  I have a copy of visual studio.net, and have started learning C# =&gt; much more powerful than VB.<br />
<br />
Visual Studio.net is a collection of compilers for different programming languages, yet they all compile to basically the same executable.  In fact, you can write part of the program in one language, and the rest in another.  In theory, its also platform indpendent (as long as there is the .net framework and Common Language Runtimes for the different OSs (Linux, Unix, Mac).</div></div><hr />

Well, VB is easier to learn than C++ (well I think it is).  I guess you could call it 'watered-down', but its not only the difficulty, its also the functionallity.<br />
<br />
The original VB does not have the same support for object-orientation (the standard way that programs are written nowadays) that C++ has.  However, VB.net DOES have this functionallity!<br />
<br />
VB (normal and .net) are both a lot more &quot;forgiving&quot; than C++, which really cuts down on the difficulty learning curve.  For example, VB looks after memory management for you, whereas (I think) in C++ you have to remember to do it yourself.  I'm no C++ expert though (can 'read' the basics of it, but couldn't do much more!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you want to use Direct X, go for MS-Visual C++.  It works.<br />

You have to do a lot of work to make a standard Windows app in Visual C++.  (Maybe easier in later versions).  <br />

<br />
Well, it is compiled into Bytecode, in a similiar fashion to Java. In fact, there is an implementation known as Jython which will compile Python into Java Bytecode. But the main implementation uses its own bytecode.<br />
<br />
This is how it has always worked.<br />
<br />
This is also reasonably similiar to how .Net works. In fact, I believe Python is also a .Net-supported language.<br />
<br />
Naturally to execute the bytecode, you need a Python runtime on your system, in a similiar way to needing a JVM on your system to execute Java bytecode, or the .Net CLR to execute .Net programs.<br />
<br />
Python is considered by many to be a 'scripting language', but this term is very very vague. Probably even more vague than 'object oriented'.<br />
<br />
As a disclaimer, I don't like Python very much for doing anything very serious, but I would say the same about VB, and C#, and Java. And I think Python is the easiest to learn of any of them.<br />

For less experienced programmers, especially if working on a small project, VB is almost certainly easier than C++ for doing things in.<br />

Also, Chieftess is right: there are many considerations other than programming language which have an effect on how successful your project will be. Knowing exactly what you're trying to build is far more important than what you choose to build it in.<br />

(same as C++ for this).<br />

You didn't optimize anything. In assembler it is gonna look the same, since you used same methods.</div></div><hr />

I didn't try to optimize it.  Point was that the VB function wouldn't have compiled.</div></div><hr />

It was still morning when I wrote that. :p</div></div><hr />

You can still make buttons in C++, but is it a lot harder?<br />
<br />
I'll see if I can download a 'trial' of Visual Basic this weekend.  Then I'll play around with it.  <br />

Sirp, I know about Python.  There's a thread in the Civ4 forum about programming in Python...I wasn't too interested though.<br />

Hm, VC++ is much more powerful and allows you to optimize speed. Anything done well on C++ will run faster than best solution of Basic, or pretty much any high level programming language. Assembler, which is not high level prog lagnuage, is only thing that will run even faster.<br />
For any serious work, C++ is neccessity, think games, operating systems, embedded software. Also C/C++ &quot;owns&quot; 90% of total embedded software market, rest is java.</div></div><hr />

Well, the same program written in any of the VisualStudio.net programs essentially compile to the same .exe (if you allow for the limitations in functionallity).  Given this, I have read rumours that Visual C# is likely to replace Visual C++ for many microsoft-written programs (including the office suites, apparently).  But given that it requires the .net CLR, this probably won't happen until the next OS (longhorn).</div></div><hr />

You can do elegant and abstract things in it - which are difficult in VB.  But I wouldn't want to be in a hurry and I wouldn't want to be paying someone to do it.</div></div><hr />

there is much more market outside microsoft than you want to see. only small amount of programming is done for windows and desktops. c++ allows more direct and richer control of hardware, especially memory. of course that VB has its use, but it is limited to windows applications where performance is not crucial.</div></div><hr />
