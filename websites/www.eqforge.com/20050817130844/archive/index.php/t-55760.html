<br />
At the end of DG2, our preferred Victory Option for this game was put to poll.  Most of the voters decided we should pursue a Spaceship victory.<br />
<br />
So, is that still what we want to do?  If so, how should we go about it?  Or do we want to change our minds altogether?<br />
<br />
This will be an ongoing discussion with no plans for an immediate poll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2003, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I say spaceship victory as we never have gotten that victory. It also will make the game longer too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2003, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Should we discuss what will be required for a Spaceship Victory? Will we need a certain amount of cities? Will they have to be Culture-laden? Will we have to keep nations like Egypt from accumalating more than twice the amount of Culture as we have? Will we need a strong Military to fend off nations that might want to attack us. What Goverment path should we take and how quickly should we move in that direction?<br />
<br />
There are a lot of things to discuss, beyond the ultimate Victory goal. Should we set up some kind of discussion format?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Immortal</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it was silly to poll before the game started, this wont help either though.<br />
<br />
I suggest we all just &quot;wait it out&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eklektikos</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2003, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Victory condition is a secondary concern in my opinion.<br />
<br />
What really matters is how we intend to play - are we looking to conquer our way to a large production base early on, or would we rather build up the cities we currently possess to their maximum potential while maintaining only a large enough army to deter our rivals from attempting any funny business? We at least need to make a decision on that if we wish to be able to make informed choices on short term issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2003, 05:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Wait it out&quot; is precisely what we will be doing for the next 4-7 turns if we decide to stay in this war.  But let's look beyond that.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
1. We need a healthy science rate.<br />
<br />
2. We need 20-25 cities(we are near enough unclaimed land to house these cities if we build them quickly enough).<br />
<br />
3. I would recommend a Monarchy to Democracy government pattern.<br />
<br />
4. We will need a strong military to defend our perimeters, as well as to respond to any threat.  I don't feel that we should have an aggressive stance this game, as we have enough unclaimed land within our grasp to bring forth a powerful nation.<br />
<br />
5. We need an equal distribution of city growth and production.  With a good part of our land being grassland and hills, this should be no problem.<br />
<br />
6. We need good fortune, some of which just landed in our lap with our meeting of the Russians.  If we play our cards right, we can net ourselves close to 400g in tomorrow's preturn.<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
I didn't intend to turn this thread into a government-sponsored campaign for peace(hey, there's a concept), but we can lay the groundwork for all these things right now.  Here's how:<br />
<br />
A. The introduction of Catherine can net us up to 380g and catch us up in techs.  This would give us close to 500g in the treasury.<br />
<br />
B. Our inflated treasury would allow us to raise the science rate.  Bringing science up to 70% would get us Polytheism in 12 turns instead of 35.  After this, we can get Monarchy and really use our land for all its worth.<br />
<br />
C. Unless we want to spend our windfall on continued military units for what may result as a stand-off, I strongly suggest that we postpone our war with Egypt for now.  For those who call this logic &quot;twisting in the wind,&quot; I should remind you that we were going to get our Golden Age even if we were attacked by Egypt.  That is unless we were to attack and defend our cities with Warriors and Spearmen.  Egyptian troops were already approaching our cities, so the call for our Legions made sense.<br />
<br />
D. Use our Legions to protect our perimeters, especially in the hills north of where Byblos once stood.  Fight a quick defensive war if our borders are threatened but always have our eye on peace.<br />
<br />
E. Expand west and claim all of the land defined by the Far West province.<br />
<br />
F. Expand south of Regia Doughnutia until we meet resistance.  So far it looks like this land is ours to claim as well if we do it quickly.<br />
<br />
G. Build Libraries, Temples and Marketplaces in all of our core cities.<br />
<br />
H. Build a harbor city north of Noshuret and send out a galley and explorer.  Build a harbor here as well so that we can be ready for luxury and resource trade.<br />
<br />
I. Plan optimum Palace/ Forbidden Palace locations to make the best use of our empire.<br />
<br />
J. As some of our cities will grow quite large, we should do whatever it takes to get the Sistine Chapel. <br />
<br />
-----------<br />
<br />
<br />
This is just for starters, and does not include minutae like making sure we start building mines just before we enter Monarchy, having at least two workers for every city, things like that.<br />
<br />
In closing, we have all the land we need just waiting for us to claim it.  There is no need this game to gain land by conquest.  This is my last call for sanity if we would like to pursue a Spaceship victory.<br />
<br />
If we want to go for Domination/Conquest again, then by all means, bombs away............</div></div><hr />
