<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2003, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was reading through the Gorina thread, and was pleasently suprised by the level of participation that  Gorinan citizens acted at.<br />
<br />
This put the idea for political workings on the provincial level in my head, but I swear dis proposed this before.  :)<br />
<br />
I would imagine such a system would work this way:<br />
<br />
Once a defined province reached a certain number of citizens, say ten, the population of the province would have the option of developing a provincial charter.  The charter would define a provincial government, with the only mandatory items being a termly gubenatorial election conducted in a certain fashion (see below), a democratic government, and recognition of the Fanatican constitution as the supreme law of the land.<br />
<br />
A big piece of this political proposal would be allowing people in a province to vote for their governor.  As I see it, this system would work if national votes were factored with the local one.  That is, a regular election poll should be posted, along with a poll only for citizens of the province.  When the vote is over, the results of both would be averaged.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Almightyjosh</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2003, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have often proposed this and in fact, in Asphinxia we actually instigated a system of provincial law (and politics) whereby citizens would vote for mayors, and the mayors would form a council that could override the Governor.  It was quite interesting!!<br />
<br />
As to the province only voting for the governor, I think we should keep the system we have now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jun 10, 2003, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have advocated local elections since DG1.  We have never gotten citizens to move about the country and become active because there is no reason for them to do so.  One gains nothing by living a city.  If we had local elections - say for mayors and governors, then our cities and provinces would become active and fun things.  Of course, mayors would need some actual power...</div></div><hr />

Then we'll evaluate it and post the conclusions and depending on the outcome continue or abandon the idea. Every citizen of Esquiline province is invited to participate.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also like this idea but with some of AJ's twist it would be better:<br />
<br />
*People in the province vote for gouvernours<br />
*People in the citys vote for mayors (if there are no citiznes, the gouvernor decides in that city).<br />
*The mayors may veto the gouvernour (if all the mayors agree).<br />
*People in and outside of the province can vote for the gouvernours but the people in the provinces votes should count more...<br />
*There may not be a mayor in a city with less then 3 people<br />
*Thus gouvernour system would not take effect unless there X people in that province (X has to be discussed)<br />
<br />
<br />
So what do you think of this???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 20, 2003, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I couldn't disagree more. <br />
*People in the province vote for gouvernoursGovernors are already elected nationally. <br />
*People in the citys vote for mayors (if there are no citiznes, the gouvernor decides in that city).The Mayor is not a position and should not be elected because of that.<br />
*The mayors may veto the gouvernour (if all the mayors agree).The Mayors offer suggestions to the governor and a wise governor discusses the proposals. The province is the governor's responsibility and therefor he (or she) should have a veto, not the other way around.<br />
*People in and outside of the province can vote for the gouvernours but the people in the provinces votes should count more...Unworkable and naief. If I want to let my vote count double I'd jump cities for, and during every election. <br />
*There may not be a mayor in a city with less then 3 peopleWhy not? And what if a city of size 4 (with a Mayor) builds a settler, reducing it to size 2 is the Mayor sacked? <br />
*Thus gouvernour system would not take effect unless there X people in that province (X has to be discussed)Too abusive. Since it's allowed to move around to different cities (and provinces) an unhappy civ3 demogame player can virtually remove a governor from office by temporarily leaving the province so that it is below X. And not to mention growing provinces. <br />
<br />
So what do you think of this???Too put it mildly: I do not agree with you fully. ;)  I do think there should be a way to remove bad-performing governors (or mayors or anyone for that matter) from office, but I think there is already a way.</div></div><hr />
