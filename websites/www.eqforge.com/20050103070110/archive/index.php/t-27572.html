If it has a good, sharp edge to edge image,and is rock-stable at 1024x768x85Hz or 1024x768x100Hz, then it's a fine deal.  Even if not, you won't find decent monitors for much less than about $160, in general.  So you did not do &quot;bad&quot;, no mater what.<br />

You can always get a kick ass deal if you know the people.  If I had the money -which I don't- I'd go get one of the LCD monitors.  But alas, hourly wages just won't cut it when you want to get top-of-the-line.</div></div><hr />

I know exactly what you mean, dawg.  When I went down to replace my video card I spent ten mintues wondering if I could put a brand new GeForce 4 Ti 4600 on my credit card and be able to pay it off before the interest nipped me in the butt.  Fortuneatly, the brain kicked in and realized that $400 was too much to pay for a video card.  Maybe next year...sigh</div></div><hr />

<br />
I felt the same... year after year. Eventually I decided to buy the best card possible and replaced my damn Voodoo3k with an MSI Geforce 4 Ti 4600.<br />
<br />
But I still can't stand that huge annoying 17&quot; MAG Innovision monitor.<br />
I want a 17&quot; LCD. But absolutely no money for that... I spent my last dime. more or less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, 179 doesn't sound horrible for a monitor...I can find a no namer online for 112$ that does 1024x768x32bit@85Hz....but the shipping to your country would kill that price, if they even ship to there (I think they are US only). It all depends on the market.</div></div><hr />
