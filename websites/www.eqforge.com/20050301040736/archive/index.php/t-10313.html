I have &quot;chieftan&quot; under my name, is that because I have a small amount of posts?  And, how do I get to change it like everyone else did?   Thanks...</div></div><hr />

The icons you can change in your personal settings.  Personally I just turn them all off so that things load more quickly.</div></div><hr />

Ah, then you are missing my dashing Mouseketeer!<br />
<br />
Also, RomanLegatus you can edit your title directly in your profile, I think it requires a certain number of posts before the option is available, or perhaps an certain time being active...I think its the latter and something like 20~30 days.</div></div><hr />

10 posts and a week (not or), AFAIK. After those requirements are fulfilled, you go to user cp &gt; edit profile (maybe edit options) and there you'll find a box to change your custom denomination (or whatever it is named).<br />
<br />
You should have posted this in the site feedback forum. You would probably get a more official response.</div></div><hr />
