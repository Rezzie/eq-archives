A challenge worthy of the strongest players who hold everyone else in the table up....<br />
<br />
Sadly I may have scored too much on GOTM9.<br />

If anyone wants to try getting the lowest score possible for a victory, they should use this variant, though it might prove to be harder to win then you want!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">col</div><div class="date">Jul 15, 2002, 08:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly! There is a tension between scoring and winning.<br />
<br />
You DONT want to conquer too much too soon or have too high a population. On the other hand if you dont, you wont win....Hence the challenge<br />
<br />
I suppose that you'd need to play it out to 2050 to avoid getting any sort of early finish bonus... Kill all your population....<br />
<br />
(Q What Is the opposite of milking?....)<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, some of us are masters at not scoring very much while scraping a win.</div></div><hr />

You woulda beat me in GOTM8.  I was so pissed at the way things went, i didn't bother to turn in my game.</div></div><hr />

I figure there's a lot of players out there who get a bit discouraged seeing SirPleb and CB turn in phenomenal scores each time. <br />
<br />
II dont care what anyone else's score is if I've had a good game. Matrix seems to feel the same judging from his comments and scores!<br />
<br />
If everyone turned in their losing games it would give the average a more meaningful and realistic level.<br />
<br />
I also felt that getting a medal or a fastest finish was impossible for 95% of the players so wanted to find a way of having a little fun and something to play for in GoTM.<br />
<br />
The worse things are going, the better - if you could just turn it round and scrape out a win .......</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone needs some kind of incentive to keep going whenthings aren't going that well and a bit of creative thinking here could add a lot to the fun of GOTM....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Col... Your on!<br />
<br />
The problem is that for me it doesn't seem to difficult to acheive a low score. I wish I could say I plan it :lol: Even in my GOTM9 quest to mix it amongst the big guns has had my right to participate in the Spoiler thread questioned :eek: <br />
<br />
As for Sulla's one city strategy I doubt it could work. Too small and your tech, money and culture would have the AI swat you at some stage or even worse ignore you!<br />
<br />
Anyway to the medal winners we salute you. And remember you need the semi-psuedo-partial-serious players - who wants to be number 1 in a competition of 5?<br />
<br />
PS. if anyone wants to hear how I turned certain GOTM8 defeat into a victory with tactical nuke on around 60 German armour pieces... in my own territory :cry: , let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">col</div><div class="date">Jul 16, 2002, 07:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've already submitted GOTM 9 but I'll be there looking up at you in GOTM 10.....<br />
<br />
The more I've thought about it, the more interesting the tactics are. I dont thnk a OCC is the way to go either!<br />
<br />
It'l will be a fine line between low score and losing and low score and winning. All those players who dominate early will rule themselves out. <br />
<br />
Could extend to a whole series of medals - lowest winning dom score, lowest winning cult score etc...<br />
<br />
Of course much depends on the game level ....(Are you listening Matrix?)</div></div><hr />

I am beginning to see an &quot;unofficial&quot; awards thread starting up...</div></div><hr />

Oh, really? Well perhaps you will be seeing a OCC game in GOTM10. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lots of different strategies to try out too. <br />
<br />
Could be OCC - could be a few closely spaced cities.<br />
Dont win too soon. <br />
Keep your area and pop down while still winning...Good luck folks.<br />
<br />
Sounds  like a fun game Phil. <br />
<br />
You know I think we have more fun in Civ3 than many. Not knowing whether you're going to win or not is much more exciting than how big a score you can get....</div></div><hr />

I got run over by barbarians, english and russians, but I decided to submit my game anyway, because it was asked specifically on the GOTM pages :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NHJ BV</div><div class="date">Jul 16, 2002, 11:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But a lowest score-award would be nice ;)</div></div><hr />

I think they just called it that instead of lowest score to make people feel better. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BoBtheBUILDER</div><div class="date">Jul 16, 2002, 04:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that it would be legitimate for the forum to acknowledge the most improved scorer from month to month.  I'd say player, but since the rankings are based on score I guess I'll go with scorer.  This could be a way of recognizing those that are working toward improving their game and finding success with it.</div></div><hr />
