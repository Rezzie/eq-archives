What spam? I get next to no spam in my hotmail inbox. It's only a spam magnet if you give out your email address willy-nilly. :p</div></div><hr />

That's funny... I tested it a while back... I signed up for a Hotmail account and didn't give it out to anyone and it quickly started getting spammed. This was a few years ago, so that account is probably long gone, but it's pretty sad when you can get spammed without giving an address out at all. In fact, on my main Hotmail account, most of the spam I get comes not from me giving my address out, but from dictionary attacks. I don't even bother checking it anymore; I only keep the account around for MSN Messenger.</div></div><hr />

Someone might have been using the email address before...<br />
<br />
Had to start using gmail more recently after saves to hotmail filled my inbox a couple of times and then blocking other emails from being received.</div></div><hr />

It's now my spam address, and I don't really care about it, but I got a new one in 2002 that is still almost spam free, though I have no idea how.  That's still sitting at 2 MB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course, you hear 'fall', you think 'september/october'.<br />
<br />
Finally got mine, too.  I'm guessing they did everyone?</div></div><hr />

I recall when they originally said they were going to do it, they said they were going to do it in July, but later it became 'fall', but maybe my memory fails me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Turner_727</div><div class="date">Nov 10, 2004, 11:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, that sounds familiar to me, too.  You're probably right.</div></div><hr />

Possibly now, although it seems they spread the upgrade over the week...</div></div><hr />

Ouch.  <br />
<br />
I now have more room for my google stock notices. :D  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Nov 17, 2004, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">250 MB for me too. I use my gmail account though now. I wish that Opera supported Active X.<br />
<br />
Your browser seems to be Internet Explorer, and ActiveX seems to be disabled. Gmail requires ActiveX to be enabled in order to operate. <br />
<br />
To use Gmail, enable ActiveX controls in Internet Explorer. You can do this by going to the Tools menu, selecting Internet Options, Security tab, Internet zone, and either select the Default Level, or selecting Custom Level and scrolling down to &quot;Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins&quot; and selecting Enable.<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems that even google doesn't know that it doesn't need Active X, it actually needs XmlHttpRequest which I.E. resolves through Active X and since I have my browser, Opera, say it is I.E. gmail gets confused. The latest Opera 7.60 Beta Preview 3 seems to support gmail though!!</div></div><hr />
