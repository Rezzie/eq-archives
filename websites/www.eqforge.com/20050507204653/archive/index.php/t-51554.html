<br />
In order to choose Continents, we will have to choose a Land Mass Percentage. We can't choose continents without choosing this factor. If we choose continents and then hit Random, we could wind up with something we didn't vote on. This is the point I was trying to make on the last page. We need to decide this quickly in a Poll. I think we should use 60% water (the least).</div></div><hr />

It will be randomly determined via a separate pseudo-random number generator and then specified on the startup screen so Continents can be specified.<br />
<br />
EDIT: <br />
<br />
Example in Excel [ =ROUNDUP(RAND()*3,0) ] gives a random return of 1, 2, or 3. Assign a coverage value to each one and go to town. Heck, do it in Excel with [ =IF(RET=1,&quot;60%&quot;,IF(RET=2,&quot;70%&quot;,RET(E1=3,&quot;80%&quot;,0))) where RET is the return from the formula above]. An archaic form such as a die could also be used for those who prefer simplicity. The forumula would be more random though. :p</div></div><hr />

Did you forget a smilie there? If not I have to say I'm pretty offended at the accusation. If you trust the Pres to hit the specified buttons on the startup screen why wouldn't you trust the same person to run a random selection for water coverage?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">Apr 28, 2003, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Generally that is true. However we presented all options with a random choice for this game, even those that do not have a random selection in the game. Obviously that has to be randomized manually. In this case the game will not allow us to simply pick the options that the players want so additional means are required to ensure that the wishes of the citizens are fulfilled.<br />

I swear that if I am elected President I will run the randomizer with my door open. Or at least all of the windows open as the new dog tends to run off if he sees the door unattended. :)</div></div><hr />

The option option for land type was to be Continents. The poll for water coverage was informational. We can't keep messing up the begining of the game like this. All we need to do to correct the error is run a quick poll. That way all the bases are covered. I'm trying to help you recover from this, not crtiticize you :) .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Apr 28, 2003, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm... I see the dilemma.  Is there a way for the first President to publicly carry out this randomization?  If we were all sitting around the table we could all see the die roll.  I don't see how we can simulate that in the forums.  :(<br />
<br />
I do see Cyc's point of view.  A big reason for choosing *random* when starting a game is that by doing so we do not know what was chosen.  By randomly picky some settings and then selecting them we lose this *unknown* effect of the randomization.  I'm assuming that's what Cyc is referring to when he calls this *cheating*<br />
<br />
Of course another reason for going random is the thinking that these particular settings are not that important so just pick one and let's play.  Looking at it from that perspective then Shaitan's suggestion is not only doable but admirable.<br />
<br />
I do hope tempers will not flare over this.  I suggest a quick info poll to let the citizens decide the matter.  It looks like the options are *unknown random* which means we could not choose continents, stick with continents and poll the other options in question, stick with continents and let the president randomly pick the other options.  We might want to split the last one into two options, one where the president keeps the actual choices secret and the other where he or she makes them public.<br />
<br />
This may seem a very minor issue to some but it is a prime example of the pitfalls of the demogame.  We all got together to choose the settings we want to use and came up with a set of choices that cannot be implemented the way they were intended to be!  Throughout the course of DG3 we will undoubtedly make many more conflicting policy decisions.  I strongly suggest that we start right here and right now on a peaceful and cooperative system of resolving such conflicts so they do not begin factionalizing us before we even start!  There are two distinct ways of looking at randomization and both are just as valid.  No one person should say *we are going to do it this way*.  Put the question before the people, let them decide the matter and then we can all move on together.</div></div><hr />

No, it is not bogus. The options were presented to the people. They chose. We are implementing them. There is a method to implement the ones that were selected with no perceptible difference to any player. There is no problem here.<br />

Bah! A sign of a good leader is the ability to admit when they're wrong, Shaitan. <br />
If I were wrong I would have absolutely no problem admitting it. In this case I am correct. A sign of a good leader is standing by a valid and correct decision.<br />
<br />
I have the means to carry out the citizens' wishes exactly as polled and I intend to do so (if I sit in the big chair, that is). As far as I'm concerned this issue is a non-issue and I will enforce the results of the polls that showed an overwhelming approval for the options already determined. As I said before you have the option of going ahead and discussing/polling whatever you'd like. I'm sorry that I don't agree with your thoughts on this matter but you are free to go see if others do.</div></div><hr />

There was no point to this post other than to bring about a negative response, so it is most definately trolling.  Please do not do it again.  If you feel that strongly about this subject, continue discussion and/or post a poll on the matter, but refrain from insults and trolling.</div></div><hr />

We chose continents in this poll. (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=50214) <br />
<br />
By doing so we chose not to use the *random* option that randomly assigns both world type (pangea/continents/archipelago) and water coverage (low/medium/high).  However, in this poll (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=50209) we chose to randomly assign land mass (aka water coverage).  In order to choose land mass/water coverage randomly it will have to be done outside of the Civ 3 game set up process.  At the time of the original polls this was overlooked.  Since some citizens may not have realized the implications of randomly picking land mass/water coverage  the issue is being repolled.<br />
<br />
This poll will be open for 48 hours.<br />
<br />
This is my suggested poll.  I don't know the percentages of water coverage.  If someone supplies them they can be used in place of low/med/high.  We can get a 2 day poll up without delaying the start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shaitan</div><div class="date">Apr 28, 2003, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The percentages are 60, 70, 80. You need one more poll option to represent the scenario I described a couple of times in this thread. Namely, an uninvolved 3rd party (my wife in my case) runs the randomizer and does the selection afte the rest of the items are set up. This way we have things exactly as the polls already decided, with nobody having knowledge of the random land mass amount (water level).</div></div><hr />

We've got to argue over SOMETHING!  It's either this or the correct spelling of my name.  And as to the announcement:  Yes, they probably will come.  Thats how I got here.</div></div><hr />

It is amazing what the demogame does for post count.  I went from 14 to 190 posts in the month since I signed up for the demogame and I'm almost 2/3 of the way to an avatar!</div></div><hr />
