<br />
I'll nominate myself.  :)  I saw in the President's thread some comments that if new people want in they have to be proactive and try to work their way in, so this is it.<br />
<br />
Now for the second part...<br />
<br />
I'll be gone for ~12 days during term 2.  If that is too long to be absent, I don't want to mess up the game by being gone so long.  So if y'all think a long absense is ok, then I accept (i.e. volunteer for the job if the citizens want me), and if comments indicate a long absense is a bad idea, then I'll decline and wait for next term.</div></div><hr />

A long abense is a bad idea, but is perfectly ok. You leave your deputy incharge with strict orders on what to do etc., but still leave them some freedom of choice during the time your gone. <br />
<br />
Also, don't expect to become Science Leader immediantly. I've been inside of the Science Department for 11 terms (11 months... almost a year) The first two of those I was Science Chat Rep and Science Deputy... then I finally became Science Leader. The other one was during a short period when Stuck &amp; Gunning controled the Science Department and I became Science Chat Rep again.</div></div><hr />
