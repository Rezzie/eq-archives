<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Squirrel2004</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2001, 08:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I'm working on this new scenario on 'Nam. It's pretty cool. I'm almost done with the units and everything else in the Rules.txt file. I wanted to take a break from working vigorously, so I said the game I was constructing. I went to play a new game, not a scenario, just a &quot;New Game&quot;. So I started it up, made my first city, went to the city screen and... ahhhhh!!!! All the units were the same as my 'Nam units and the improvements were the same, too, but they had the grphics of the real units from the actual game(i.e. the unit Thai Enlist had the graphic of a Partisan, which is what was replaced by Thai Enlist in 'Nam). I exited the game and took a look at the Rules.txt file in the Civ2 MGE folder. Everything was okay, except the Units, Improvement and Wonders. I don't know what the hell happened. I was wondering if you have any clue what to do. If I have to, I'll rewrite Rules.txt, but I want to know why that happened. Uninstalling the game would be my last resort, because I don't want to lose my games and scenarios. Please help me!<br />

<br />
Can't you get the &quot;rules.txt&quot; off your CD?<br />
If you can't get it otherwise, I'll be happy to supply you with the lost file. Which version of Civ are you using? I can help you if you have the classic or MGE version. Just send me a mail, and I'll be happy to help out. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif</div></div><hr />

All is well in the Squirrel's household! Happy Father's day to all!</div></div><hr />

Go to  Power Archiver (http://www.powerarchiver.com)  and download their free .zip file engine. It works just as well as WinZip at unziping files. <br />
