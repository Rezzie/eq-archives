<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skaternate</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 09:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heres my question and it's background.  There is only two cities and two civs left in my game, the germans and the Axtecs, each with one town.  I have the aztec town surrounded for milking, and was finishing off the german civ.  I hit there last town yet it did not kill them!  They respawned with a setter and five units, about 20 tiles to the right!  I had just the previos turn moved units passed that space and have nearby boats so I no they were not just chillin, but that they actually respawned.  Up unitll now I had assumed that respawning only happens before 1000bc since that is the only time i have seen it happen.  Does anyone out there know exactly what is needed for civ respawning or how to stop it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The common myth that re-spawning is affected by the date is false.<br />
<br />
The details on respawning AI civs:<br />
<br />
- AI civs can only be respawned once.<br />
- For an AI civ to respawn, there must be an unclaimed, unoccupied tile on the same continent as the one where it was eliminated (by killing it's last settler or last city) and no other civs can have territory or units within a 5-tile radius of this tile. The tile must also allow cities to be built upon it (i.e., no mountains/water using default rules).<br />
<br />
The respawned civ loses the following:<br />
- All embassies/spies<br />
- All units<br />
- All colonies<br />
<br />
The respawned civ gets the following:<br />
- 1 city<br />
- 3 defensive units<br />
- 1 offensive unit<br />
- 1 settler/start unit 1<br />
- 1 worker/start unit 2<br />
- All bonus starting units based on difficulty level<br />
- Their gold is increased by starting_gold X 10 (i.e., 100 gold using default rules).<br />
<br />
Everything else (culture, at war, techs, etc.) remains unchanged.</div></div><hr />
