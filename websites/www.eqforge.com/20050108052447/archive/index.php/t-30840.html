Celeron: 1.7G<br />
OS: W2K Pro<br />
RAM: 512 PC2100<br />
HD's: Maxtor 40G, Maxtor 60G<br />
<br />
Will need some space for games like civiii, total war etc.<br />
Will need some space for storage of data, about 35G worth.<br />
<br />
Been advised that I should create a small partition exclusively for Kazaa, or WinMX Downloads and then cut/paste the files to a data partition as these downloads are very fragmented.<br />
<br />
Been advised to create a FAT32 partition to store a Norton Ghost file image of my OS and Applications.<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
<br />
What would you guys suggests?  How many partitions and how big each partition on the two drives, and what goes in which partition?<br />
<br />
Kinda of topic... but why a FAT32 for Ghost and everything else NTFS?</div></div><hr />

Use the 60 gig for your OS and progs and use your other for storage (and scan the crap out of it daily for viruses).<br />
<br />
That's all you need.  You can put your Ghost image on it and all is well.  I partition if I have multiple os's running on the same h/d.  That's it.  <br />
<br />
Don't forget you can also map a network drive.  Good way to keep things segregated.</div></div><hr />

My freind hs two hard drives partitioned into eight sections and it's just a beast to find anything.  Here's how I do it:<br />
<br />
I set aside about ten gigs for the primary OS and critical system applications like ZoneAlarm, Nero, Maxmem, Winace, Winrar, WinISO, Ghost, Norton Antivirus, etc.  If I had a larger hard drive on the primary then I'd set aside a seperate partition for other applications like Maple, Sibelius, Photoshop, Mathematica, etc; but as it is, I just throw those onto the OS partition.  For games I've got another partition (about 15 gigs) and the third partition is for my donwloaded stuff and the things I use to get those downloaded things (like Direct Connect, eDonkey, WS_FTP).  I used to keep the p2p apps on a seperate partition, but I learned the the time that it takes for the drives to shuffle info from one partition to the other becomes a big hassle.<br />
<br />
Mix and match it as you like, but as I said before, stay away from creating dozens of partitions.  <br />
<br />
Kinda of topic... but why a FAT32 for Ghost and everything else NTFS?<br />
<br />
It really doesn't matter.  If you're going to ghost your OS partition and your applications just stick with whatever file format you prefer.  If your using NTFS, ghost it in NTFS.  The only advantage with FAT is that it'll be reverse compatible with Windows 9x OSs...but if your ghosting 2k, why bother?<br />
<br />
Edit:  Use Partition Magic to partition your drives.  It's the best.</div></div><hr />

Clearly a superior alternative.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Sep 07, 2002, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was thinking about that...but they be expensive. The next step was removeable HDD (the machine has to be off before taking them out).<br />
What I really need is at least 2 computers so I can work on Linux while I am using XP.....also makes it easier to test out a server to have a client connect to it.</div></div><hr />
