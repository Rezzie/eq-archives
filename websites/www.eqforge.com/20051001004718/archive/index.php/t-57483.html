<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DaveShack</div><div class="date">Jul 01, 2003, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The citizens have chosen a switch to Monarchy, but there is an urgent remaining question.  When should the switch occur?  Settlers need to be produced as soon as possible to claim some territory while we still have the chance, and going into anarchy would stop us dead in our tracks for 5-6 turns.  The seafaring nations might settle our borders if we don't hurry.<br />
<br />
This discussion will run for 24 hours.  I call upon our Domestic Deputy (if I win the runoff) or Leader to post the following poll tomorrow, as I'll be on the road then and therefore without access.<br />
<br />
When shall we switch governments?<br />
<br />
 Immediately, next turn chat<br />
 Wait until the current crop of settlers is done<br />
 Wait until our space is filled<br />
 Other (please specify)<br />
 Abstain<br />
 <br />
<br />
The first 2 choices (now, current crop) are gradated vs (space filled, other).  If they get more votes combined than (space filled) combined, then that should be seen as a vote for as soon as possible.  See the Polling Standards for a description of a gradated poll.<br />
<br />
Let the discussion begin ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jul 01, 2003, 10:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I beleve we should wait untill the current crop of Settlers are done. During the transition of Anarchy, The Production of Units and Improvements would be halted since Anarchy is basicly a Shut down of all productivity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyc</div><div class="date">Jul 01, 2003, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those of you who do not want to look at the save, ;) we have four Settlers in production at this time. The one in Regi Doughnutia will be complete next turn, so I have already recomended that we wait for that one (we will also get a Worker!). The others are:<br />
<br />
Noshuret - 4 turns<br />
Nur Gisnod - 6 turns<br />
Tyvek - 4 turns<br />
<br />
The Sience Department would like to again state that if the Sci Rate Slider was moved to 80% (-4gpt), we would complete research on Currency in 8 turns. This would give us an extra bargaining chip at the trade table, as we are currently technologically advanced. If we were to change the production of Lake Asphinia from a Legion to a Worker, it could join the other Workers around the lake in completing a road to the Elephantine Hills. This would allow us to trade our excess luxs to Egypt, at the very least, and bring our own luxs to Elephantine and Memphis. <br />
<br />
I guess what I'm trying to say is if we are going to wait 6 turns for the Settlers, which is not a bad idea, we might as well wait an additional 2 turns for Currency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jul 01, 2003, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also think we should wait until currency if ours before heading into anarchy.  I'm not sure the science slider should be raised to 80% just yet.  I'd like to see the luxury rate upped a notch.  This would allow us to put Noshuret's entertainer to work allowing that city to produce a settler in three turns rather than four.  I have also begun contacting our department leaders and governors to see if there are any other city projects that should be completed before our revolution.<br />
<br />
We should also wait and see what the new build queues are going to be.  We can certainly halt the production of legions immediately.  We have 24 which is enough as it is for now and we still have 8 warriors that could be upgraded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 07:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree. When the start of the anarchy period is known upfront we can prepare our buildqueus, research, workers etc. on this. <br />
<br />
If we vote (and I think we should) I vote revolt as soon as we have currency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">D'yer Mak'er</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some micromanagement thoughts:<br />
<br />
Noshuret:<br />
if the citizen currently working the lake in Nosuret is swithed to the irrigated plains, the settler would be done in 3 turns without raising the lux. <br />
<br />
Nur Gisnod:<br />
if one citizen in Nur Gisnod is swithched to work a forest, we could get a settler in 4 turns.<br />
<br />
Inadatto:<br />
I'm not sure what plans we have for this city, but if we switch the 2 citizens currently working grasslands in Inadatto to work on forests instead, this city could also produce a settler in 4 turns (while losing 4 units of food to shortage). <br />
<br />
<br />
This way, togehter with Tyvek and Regia Doughnutia, we could get 5 settlers in 4 turns before making the switch. <br />
<br />
(of course, switching the Gorina production would give another one if we wanted)</div></div><hr />

Yes, food gathering and population growth continue to occur during anarchy at the same rate as under depotism.</div></div><hr />

<br />
During periods of anarchy, all Gathering and Production Halts for a time. I beleve the Cities still gather food to be self supportive. Though there is a chance for a Massive riots to happen.</div></div><hr />

D'yer Mak'er's ideas for micromanaging settlers before anarchy seems pretty good. <br />
<br />
True bacon king, but if we're going to wait until we get Currency to revolt, then there's no need to limit the growth of the cities.</div></div><hr />
