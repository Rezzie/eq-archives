I plan to play again on Thursday or Friday.<br />
<br />
Both new cities are building warriors.<br />
<br />
We are just about to discover Monarchy. Does someone want to check the Oedo year? What shall we research next?<br />
<br />
Ellie has almost finished exploring. Where should she go next?<br />
<br />
I think there may be land on the very western edge of the map. Does anyone agree?<br />

Does anyone agree? Where else is Ellie going to go?  I doubt the land mass goes any further, but might as well explore all the black we can, then send her back North.  We may need some riot control by then, and once we get some roads between our cities she'll be a good roving defense force.</div></div><hr />

Two more cities, wonderful:goodjob:  I'll make a poll on what to do next in our cities.<br />
<br />
About ellie: I don't think the land continues, but I might be wrong (there's a land tile 4W 2SW of LC). I think we should check it out, it's godd to know what the coast really looks like, and if there are good cityspots.</div></div><hr />

Although it might take a bit long to get there with 2 settlers (1 to mine)..<br />
It can even be turned to a 4 special site since the shielded riversquare in it's region is also at the location for a special..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DvR</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2003, 12:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, 2 more things:<br />
- Move warrior into Ipec to restore civil order..<br />
- Change RF's worker from the shield to the riversquare.. We will lose some food production, but that doesn't matter because when RF grows it'll fall into civil disorder.. We'll gain one trade with it causing our income to go from 4 to 5 gold per turn..</div></div><hr />

2050BC is the next oedo year, and it looks like we'll get monarchy in the next 2 or 3 turns. If three, you'll be able to revolt when you get it.<br />
<br />
We could adjust our science so we get it on the correct turn and have an instant revolt. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait a munute, why does that format look familiar. Ahh now I reconise it. That would be the Timeline that the Civ3 GOTM QSC and the SG uses :). <br />

Perhaps our Domestic advisor should start a poll?  (perhaps our ex-Science Advisor should look before posting :blush:  My apologies if already taken care of)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Apr 07, 2003, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think Neumatic should RB the temple a few turns from now and start a wonder.<br />
<br />
I doubt there is more land to the west so maybe the elephant should return to Neumatic/RF to be ready to kill barbarians that might show up since these are the two most valuable cities. Also in that case we could send Neumatic's warrior west once LP's phalanx arrives there.<br />
<br />
Once we get monarchy it could be a good idea to speed up RF's production of the settler by switching to the buffalo (actually we might want to do this immediately since there will be civil disorder in RF when it grows to size 3 unless units are added for riot control).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not much use for exploring now - send 'er back for domestic control.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2003, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to let Ellie have a quick look at the black to find the coast line. We'd hate to ignore it then find it's a land bridge.<br />
<br />
The land I'm talking about is the ocean square. If you zoom in it looks more yellow compared to the ocean square further south.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">Apr 08, 2003, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@Octavian-If the Foreign Affairs Ministry doesn't need the Elephant for now, doesn't it fall under the control of the Military and not Domestic?<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think the Elephat should finish exploring its part of the continent. I wouldn't bet on there being a land bridge, but there's chance that its there. Once the Elephant is done exploring it should head back to defend the center of our nation against Barbs.<br />
<br />
I agree with TheViking that we should RB the temple and start a wonder in Neumatic. The question is which wonder? I am would like to see us build the Colussus, but let's all discuss it before a decision is made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Apr 09, 2003, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">iirc, Colossus is the only Wonder we can build at the moment. However, we haven't decided what to research after Monarchy so more could be available in 10 or so turns.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to build HG in Neumatic (start Col, switch later), and build Col in southern hill city, because it has much more trade with rivers and specials:)</div></div><hr />

I would be willing to start Colossus in Neumatic if we know we'll have time to switch to Hanging Gardens.</div></div><hr />
