<br />
1) If my civ is the only one with the tech to see a resource, say coal/oil, and I trade world maps with another civ, can I find coal/oil on their map when they can't see it?   Can they see coal/oil on my map even when they don't know what it is?<br />
<br />
2) When I get a tech advance that allows me to see a new strategic resource, do I need to re-explore old areas, or do they show up at the far-reaches of my maps which are no longer visible?<br />
<br />
3) Occasionally, strategic resouces get exhausted that I'm not using.   For example, uranium got used up even though I had no tech to use it.   A bug?<br />
<br />
4) Because of exhaustion of strategic resouces, if you have several sources, should you avoid building a road to some?   For example, if I have 3 sources of iron, and I don't want to trade any, can I avoid run out by only building a road to one pocket at a time, and build to another if it runs out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
2: I don't.<br />
<br />
3: Feature.  Not a bug.  The game is designed this way.  Lends it unpredictability.  Horses do not run out, however.<br />
<br />
4: No use them all.  Exhaustion is RANDOM not related to how much you use them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VoodooAce</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 02:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 &amp; 2 - When you discover a tech that allows you to see a resource, it appears immediately, all over  the map.  You needn't explore any areas that are already visible.  In other words, the fog of war doesn't effect your ability to see resources.  The other civ, however, will not see the resource, and thus can not trade it, until they get the right tech.<br />
<br />
3 &amp; 4 - Resources being 'depleted' is totally random.  Whether you use the resource at all, or not, it can still 'disappear' and reappear somewhere else.  Rubber, in addition to horses, never gets depleted.</div></div><hr />

No rules changes, but makes it more obvious where those darn coal deposits are hidden.  My eyes hurt a lot less now than they used to...<br />

<br />
But one trick that allows you to find resources extremely quickly is to hit ctrl-shift-m.  It erases all the irrigation/roads/mines from the map.</div></div><hr />
