Actually, I'd probably prefer you didn't.  I would get all obsessed again and have to try to beat yours.  My fiance is pleased to have me back during the evenings now, and I'm not sure she'd be to keen on seeing me at it again.<br />
<br />
Well, enjoy in any case!<br />

shadowdale, I can add your game to the custom map section of the Hall of Fame, but not on the regular deity section...</div></div><hr />

I'll just have to start a new game when I get the time!!<br />

BTW Can we use the patch to increase the map size and still submit the game to the Hall of Fame???<br />
