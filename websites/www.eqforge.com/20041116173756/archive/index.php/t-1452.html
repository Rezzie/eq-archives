<br />
That's right! This project did not go forgotten as some might have thought. I've finally gotten back to reworking the graphics and stamping out the general Classic Civ II scenario part of it. I am still working on the EVENTS file which will actually be only a single events file--however--I intend to create an events file for each version (CiC, FW, and MGE). <br />
<br />
Obviously, the game will run more complete and best on MGE, but right now, on CiC, it's fun and that is what matters.<br />
<br />
First of all, I'd like to say that the name of the &quot;1776&quot; scenario is actually 'BIRTH OF AMERICA'. BEBRO created the title.gif (a fine job) along with a few other graphics.<br />
<br />
The scenario is about the Revolutionary War in America, but from a world perspective (world theater). You see, where I've seen other Rev War scenarios fall short is that it was never as simple as a fight in America and that was that. Many other countries were involved in different aspects of the war and colonization during that period. Their participation could have changed if certain things did occur or 'did not' occur politically. Things could have turned out so different for Americans that to leave out these other nations is to pass up the opportunity to play a really intriguing part of history. <br />
<br />
The point of this scenario is not to be historically exact. It's more like what people do in WWII scenarios (playing the Germans as I know you guys do) to see if you can get a different outcome. You can of course play the Americans, which is still quite a challenge. <br />
<br />
YOU MAY NOW DOWNLOAD THIS SCENARIO!!!<br />
<br />
I will include a small events file (the working file missing the historical items) just so you can see the layout of the scenario. I am working on game balance and need some help getting that right. Thanks for all the help and leave your comments for play test in this thread.<br />

<br />
You will most likely want to play the 'Spanish', they have a special unit called: &quot;Conquistadore&quot;<br />
<br />
The French have: &quot;Legionaires&quot;<br />
<br />
The Americans have: &quot;Armed Colonists&quot;<br />
<br />
The English have: Royal Troops<br />
<br />
In addition, each civ gets to build or receives at the start of the scenario a &quot;commander&quot; to lead them to victory. This is to give some of the civs an edge in a tight situation. There is also a &quot;Benedict Arnold&quot; unit, that both the British and the Americans have (this unit will disappear when it is lost on either side although that event will not be included at this time).<br />
<br />
Let me get this thing zipped and that way I can upload it tomorrow.<br />

I am sorry but I could not send you the files...this is not any fault of mine, but I cannot seem to access my address book again...please send an email so that I may send you both the files...<br />
<br />
(of course, by the time you do this I will probably be able to access the address book, if that makes any sense!)<br />

How is the &quot;generations&quot; project going? I'd like to see more parts before I prepare a review.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Jun 09, 2001, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey Chris!<br />
<br />
Well although this is the 1776 thread, I will tell you that ST:Generations is cooking hot as ever. I've got two tentatively running new additions: &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; and &quot;Voyager: The Return Home&quot; up and running. The DS9 scenario is under construction &quot;Mirror, Mirror&quot; and I am still contemplating my TNG scenario. <br />
<br />
The goal of ST:GEN is really to build a modpack that can accomodate 5 separate ST scenarios and still be played as a modpack. I've found it to be a great challenge but I've seemed to make it work (without getting cheesey either!). Quality has been my biggest thrust for this project, so I've been a bit slow, but as with 1776, the release date is early summer anyway. <br />
<br />
I've found lately that the volume and amount of changes that I have been making to create my scenarios has risen to an astronomical number. I don't know if I doing more to make it better or if I remaking civ sometimes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'll let you know more about ST:Gen by sending you the DS9 scenario when I finish it...<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2001, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, <br />
<br />
Thanks to numerous comments, suggestions and ideas...1776 (Birth of America) has been reworked and given a number of changes that are too numerous to mention...<br />
<br />
No more betas will be posted at this time...however, the next version to be posted will be the version 1.0 with the different events files.<br />
<br />
I wanted to thank everyone thus far, just as before in the Antarctica beta test which was a huge success for numerous changes that I think made the scenario a lot better.<br />
<br />
Thanks everyone,<br />
<br />
John</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Jul 09, 2001, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok everyone, <br />
<br />
Here is the update:<br />
I'm working on the finishing touches now. <br />
Which include the readme file and changing some of the names of the Dutch cities. I've managed to change the color of the Dutch to Orange through some really painstaking effort, and I also changed the city style of the Dutch as well. The scenario is extremely short in number of turns (25), but it is appropriate for what you expected to achieve (even so, when I play test the game it takes more than 2-1/2 hours). There are several civs that can be played to score objectively but playing the Portuguese, Dutch or Spanish will increase the difficulty of the game. <br />
<br />
Also, everything is accellerated to meet the needs of a fast game, so money, production and so on have been adjusted for many civs. There have been a number of graphics and sound changes as well to improve the scenario and you should expect to see the new files at the end of the week if I can finish the readme files on time. <br />
<br />
In addition, this scenario WILL be playable in all versions of Civilization (except ToT) as I have been testing it with all versions.<br />
<br />
More later,<br />
<br />
John<br />
