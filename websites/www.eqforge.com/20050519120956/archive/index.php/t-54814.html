<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">Jun 01, 2003, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since we are now at war, the primary focus of many cities will be units, though one or two cities will be directed to continue producing settlers.  Right now, I propose:<br />
<br />
Noshuret<br />
<br />
Legion, Legion, Legion, Legion<br />
<br />
If at some point during the war we seem to have the advantage, I would like to build a temple here.  If we wait until it is is population 4, it shouldn't take very long.<br />
<br />
Gorina<br />
<br />
Are we simply planning on not building a wonder?  Anyway, since we are in dire need of units now, the queue is Temple, Legion, Legion, though I would like it to attempt to build a wonder at some point.<br />
<br />
Penguinadua<br />
<br />
I am actually going to post a poll on this.  If we build a temple, the expansion of this city's cultural borders would make it a much more effective settler factory because of the cow tile it would have access to.<br />
<br />
Nar Shadaa<br />
<br />
This city will continue producing warriors and workers until domestic tells me we have enough workers.  Please keep the next worker nearby to bring irrigation to Nar Shadaa and Xak Tsaroth.<br />
<br />
Funkytown (this should be renamed Xak Tsaroth)<br />
<br />
For the time being I want this to be our second 'Citadel'.  It should produce a barracks and then warriors.  Make sure to not connect it to the rest of the empire, although a road leading east almost to Noshuret would allow us to get units produced here to the front much faster.<br />
<br />
Inadatto<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this city is under my control.  If it is, complete the temple and then produce settlers as quickly as possible.  Irrigation of the cow tile to the west would help in this respect.</div></div><hr />

It is an improvement that is truly needed by our thriving city. A barracks to follow has been suggested by the citizens of Gorina, but I understand the urgency of getting troops to the front line in times of war. Thank you for letting us have our Temple.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 02, 2003, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">eyrei, have I missed something?  I don't believe we have defined our provincial borders yet, or at least I haven't seen a poll for it.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, all cities are yours.  I will contact Chieftess right away so that we can resolve this issue and give you some help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 02, 2003, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lord Governor, <br />
<br />
I just want to know something now. When will Peri resign as mayor of Penguinadua and are there, besides me, other candidates and if so when will the new mayor be appointed/elected ? <br />
<br />
I ask this because I don't want to forfeit or 'forget' to do my duties.</div></div><hr />
