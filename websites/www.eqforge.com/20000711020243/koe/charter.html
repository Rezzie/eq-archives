                    members will not attack another player unless attacked first. 
                    Guild members may kill another player only in self defense. 
                    The guild does not support Player vs Player combat. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">2. Guild 
                    members will not cheat other players out of gold, items, or 
                    experience. Guild members may sell items and equipment, but 
                    they will not provide false information to the buyer. (i.e. 
                    selling of empty potions or items that look similar) </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">3. Guild 
                    members will not actively steal kills from other players. 
                    While hunting, if a guild member comes across another player 
                    the guild member will not actively attack monsters on the 
                    other players square unless asked for assistance or the guild 
                    member asks for and receives permission first. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">4. Guild 
                    members will strive to be examples to the player community. 
                    If another player asks for assistance due to stun, death, 
                    blindness, poison, or death pile recovery, assistance will 
                    be rendered, if the guild member feels they are able to do 
                    so without suffering death themselves. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">5. Guild 
                    members will not interrupt another parties hunt or lair battle 
                    unless permission to join has been asked and granted or the 
                    guild member is asked for assistance. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">6. Bounty 
                    hunting is a community violation and lynch mobs will not be 
                    formed to track down player killers. If a guild member is 
                    killed, the guild member will contact the guild leadership 
                    and ask for assistance. Revenge killings and lynch mobs give 
                    a guild a bad image. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">7. Guild 
                    members should always strive to keep peace within the community 
                    and should offer moderation in a conflict instead of taking 
                    sides. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">8. Guild 
                    members will always evenly distribute gold and treasure earned 
                    during a hunt after the hunt or lair battle has been concluded 
                    and the party returns to town. Guild members may refuse a 
                    share of treasure, but a share will always be offered first. 
                    Rare items will be distributed among the guild members on 
                    an equal basis. Each member will be given a chance to receive 
                    a rare piece of treasure. </font></p>
                  <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">9. Each 
                    guild member will have a voice within the guild and no decisions 
                    that affect the members will be made without a majority vote. 
                    A time frame will be determined by the Guild Captain at the 
                    time of the vote. If a member does not vote within that time 
                    frame the member will forfeit their right to a vote on that 
                    issue. </font></p>
