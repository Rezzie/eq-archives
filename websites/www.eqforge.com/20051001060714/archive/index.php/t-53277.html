<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sheep</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Many years ago a young boy named Maximus was born into the barbarian tribes of the 'Dividing Peaks'.  His father who is only known as Biggus, was killed by a raiding party of warriors from the civilisation of Fanaticus.<br />
<br />
While his village still burned to the ground, Maximus fled, arriving into the Great city of Gorina.  Without much he led a life of poverty, until a rich man caught him trying to steal a plate of food from his table.<br />
<br />
With the lack of laws, he saw it only fit to adopt the young boy and name him his own.  Maximus became Maximus Desmond Neverilis.<br />
<br />
Many years passed and he became more and more aquainted with his new life in the Lower Gentry.  Ten years after his arrival in Fanaticus, he married a gorgeous commoner, Livia Nigelias Neverilis.  Unfortuantley his adoptive father died three weeks before the wedding, that saw barbarian boy become loyal and secure Fanticus citizen.<br />
<br />
With the birth of their first child, Maximus Desmond Neverilis II<br />
the line became secured.  Long live the line of Neverlis!  After Maximus II came his brother Juluis Desmond Neverlis, and his twin sister, Agrippa Livia Neverilis.</div></div><hr />
