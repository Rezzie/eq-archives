They became much better with Fantastic Worlds, so a player who likes scns should have that add-on or the MGE version, which allows to play FW scns. Several online shops still sell MGE, sometimes even FW at very low prices http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Test of Time has even more and better options for scenario design, but since there were no editors included, it is a lot more work to make scns than for FW or MGE</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivPartisan</div><div class="date">Feb 10, 2001, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Håkan Eriksson and Prometeus:<br />
<br />
I don't believe there is another upgrade on the web for Classic Civ II to anything higher than version 2.42<br />
<br />
As a modpack writer, I can tell you Håkan that I will continue to write mods that can be used for Classic Civ II. In addition, I try to write as many scenarios as I can that also have playability on Classic Civ II as well...the Antarctica Scenario is one that will run on your version...if you're interested...I am also working on a major Star Trek mod called Generations that will have at least 5 scenarios that will be playable for Classic Civ II. In fact, I am currently working on Classic Civ II scenarios for all of my mods...<br />
<br />
I do have some FW scenarios, but I expect to convert all of my scenarios to play on everything Classic Civ II or higher...this way everyone can play and I can reach a larger audience...<br />
<br />
Getting back to your question Håkan, authors are often forced to write scenarios in whatever version they have...if all they have is FW...then that is what you get...I happen to have all the versions of civ to test my work on...(sometimes I forget to test it on one of the versions and then that messes me up). If you have any questions or special requests...just let me know...<br />
<br />
Hey! I'm not your cool lists? What's up with that!<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />

<br />
But I must say that I am not a big Star Trek fan.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, I have decided to just have five people in my cool book so to get in you must be cooler than someone that is in it.http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/king2.gif But if you start making civ2 classic modpacks and scenarios, then I can assure you that you will go strait to top of the list!http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif ... hum.. Now then I think about it you have already done a lot of nice modpacks.http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/goodwork.gif I rely liked the Outer Space modpack and Mars modpack were nice.http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/cwm40.gif I think you should be in my cool book. But i wonder which one to replace.http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/shakehead_ron.gif<br />

<br />
You don't need to replace anyone in your cool book http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
<br />
...as soon as I finish up the readme.txt files for Antarctica you'll be the first to get a playtest copy...http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
hehe...it's good enough for me that you say we are friends... Who knows, I might need directions to Stockholm if I go to Sweden someday.<br />
<br />
I also have a new American Revolution scenario on the back burner...it's kind of a world perspective with a large world map that depicts the events of the rest of the world too...it's in very early development but I have been researching the era...I might make the timeline from 1750 to about 1800...but nothing is certain yet...<br />
<br />
by the way, I am open to ideas if anyone is interested...<br />

It would be just a modpack conversion, then build the scenario from the map...maps are universal...that's an awesome idea...<br />

<br />
1. There is a site on the web where you can download the Fantastic Worlds files. This is not approved by Hasbro.<br />
<br />
This is JValdezToo-<br />
If it's not approved, I have to delete the link, even it is just a few files. (sorry).<br />
<br />
2. There is also a little program which converts FW-built scenarios to Classic formating. Similarly there is a program to convert MGE/UCC-builds to FW. The trouble is that the scenario may use the extra units from FW onwards, or (for MGE scenarios) use too many events to work in FW.<br />
