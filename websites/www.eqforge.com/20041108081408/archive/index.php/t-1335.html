I am designing a Civ 2 Scenario for the first time. I am designing a scenrio based on stories from the Bible. (No I'm not a freak!) The Editor menu says that I can change the names of tribes (I need to create Assyrians and Hittites) but when I go into the Edit Tribe menu, it won't let me change the name of any tibes. What do I do? Please help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BeBro</div><div class="date">Apr 01, 2001, 03:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">CivFreak, you can edit the tribe name and its leader name via &gt;cheat menu &gt;edit king.<br />
Then make the same thing again for the next tribe...http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
You can also edit tribe names via notepad or so directly in the rules.txt http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

The way I did it was to edit the rules.txt and city.txt with notepad. This gives you more control I feel. Also, by editing city.txt you can control the names of cities founded in the game, so you won't have Washington appearing in the desert! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
Another thing to note is that you can only have 1 tribe of each color at the same time, so Hittites and Assyrians must have different colors. I had to change some of the colors for my modpack, or else the Romans and the Celts would never be able to fight, as they are both white!<br />

<br />
First all what version of civ are you using?<br />
<br />
You may already have an editor included in the civ.<br />
<br />
At any rate, you may want to use adobe PS, PSP or some other suitable editor.<br />
<br />
Also, you should know that there are a number of archives that have units available here at Civfanatics and other sites:<br />
 http://www.c-o-p.com/gil/index.html <br />
 http://www.lott.co.uk/Civ2msu.htm <br />
 http://users.sgi.net/~harden/index.html <br />
<br />
Try these sites because there is other info there as well.<br />
<br />
If you need more help...jes' holler...<br />

<br />
There is a command to do this in the events. However, it is quite limited and only units not doing anything at that moment will respnd.<br />
<br />
And as player or AI you can't change it's order/direction?<br />
<br />
It works only for AI and you can't change it during the game.<br />
<br />
By the Way; how Do I can change they turns<br />
not to pass a year, but a week or month?)<br />
<br />
You can adjust the turn interval to whatever you want and also the starting year - in cheat/scenario parameters.</div></div><hr />
