<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2002, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apparently, Firaxis is putting out a new patch on Friday.  Do we intend to use this patch?  I am worried about switching patches in midgame, as it could have unknown effects, but there should be some very desireable improvements in it.  We will probably want to wait until we know what it will do, but the readme does come out today, so we can begin discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bill_in_PDX</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2002, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I like what the readme.txt file had to say for changes.  From a trade perspective it seems to promise some needed improvements.<br />
<br />
I recall that our early formative discussions for this game indicated that we would always use the latest patch.  I propose we use it.<br />

That is a fate I don´t wish for anyone.<br />
<br />
Edit: Daaraa, I saw your pm and just answered to it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daaraa</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2002, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm in the same boat as Mr Spice.<br />
I say go with the new patch.<br />
<br />
PS. - Mr Spice I PMed you regarding the different patches.  Didn't want to spam the thread. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2002, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am just worried that, like the 1.16 patch, if you install it half way through a game, it will possibly generate bugs.  Would a couple of our more technically skilled citizens look into this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daaraa</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2002, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was something else I noticed when I went from 1.16 to 1.17 briefly.  My 1.16 games (I had about 4 on the go) didn't work very well in 1.17.  I had a lot of crashes.  Finally I reloaded 1.16 and restarted a few turns back. (That felt like cheating a little as a lot happened in those few turns)<br />
I would say that until the possibility of bugs going from 1.17 to 1.21 is ruled out we should stick with 1.17.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grey Fox</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2002, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Patches are easily uninstalled, so we could stick with 1.17 if there would be problems using the 1.21 patch.<br />
<br />
But I would like to use it for the game, if it wasn't for the crash risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Badluck</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2002, 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We should use the latest patch<br />
<br />
i never had any prob with game started on 1.16 and finished on 1.17.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falcon02</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2002, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We should at least TRY 1.21.  As Gray Fox pointed out, we can always go back to v. 1.17 if we have any problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benjamin Miller</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2002, 05:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd say go with it. It seems to fix many problems with 1.17f.</div></div><hr />

We should at least TRY 1.21.  As Gray Fox pointed out, we can always go back to v. 1.17 if we have any problems. Go with it! :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SKILORD</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2002, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well we might as well give it a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2002, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is there any way to keep a copy of our game going that would be safe from any bugs that occur because we switched patches in mid-game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daaraa</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2002, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone can keep it on thier computer zipped up.  It won't get corrupted.  If it is needed that person can repost it.  I'm sure that would work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XIII</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2002, 07:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just got an email fr TF that the patch is out! :D Well, what's the final decision now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bill_in_PDX</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2002, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been running the patch for two hours.  Very stable, no issues using a save game.<br />
<br />
Only surprising changes I see are that the barbs seem a little &quot;tougher&quot; to beat.  But that could well be small sample size of two battles.<br />
<br />
Otherwise stack movement only works for awake units, but I understand there were complaints about how it worked before and this is actually a fix.<br />
