<br />
0.  This is a fun quiz....<br />
<br />
1. This thread is similar to all the other Cumulative quizzes, except all questions need to be related to computers.<br />
<br />
2. The first person to answer the current question correctly, when confimed by the question's author may post the next question. <br />
<br />
3. If you're the current questioner, try and visit daily to check replies; you can give hints if necessary.<br />
<br />
4. The basic idea is that you ask and reply based on what you know and have learned... it's not a battle of databases and reference books ;).<br />
<br />
5. Some examples of questions topics might be hardware, software, internet, prgramming, computer history... <br />
<br />
6.  Be considerate and merciful.... if no one gets the answer after about 5 days max, let us in on the answer and ask a new question :).<br />
<br />
7.  If the question ages about 5 days with no reply from the author, then the 1st one who posted the &quot;right&quot; answer can post the next question; if that is ambigious, then the person who replied immediately after the author's original question can go next &amp; get the quiz back on track.  :)<br />
<br />
8.  Extra info:  After people give their answer and a topic is disposed of, people may feel free to consult search engines &amp; reference material to clarify &amp; post minor details, since very few people including me can remember everything 100%.... Hopefully, we'll all learn tidbits as we go along, and post-question references can help make sure final answers are complete... so no one get annoyed if someone else adds some more details or makes minor corrections after the fact ;).  Naturally, question makers should know the main details (correct answers) to their question before hand, LOL....<br />

What was the name of the first Electronic computer?<br />
<br />
Bonus:  What was the fate of this first machine?<br />
<br />
Bonus #2: In what nation was it built it and why?<br />
<br />
Hint:  I'm not talking about the Abacus, or adding machines, etc... I'm talking about a massive electrical/electronic machine, LOL...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">King of Camelot</div><div class="date">Jun 15, 2002, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very close Phillippe!<br />
The first electronic computer was ENAIC(Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer)<br />
<br />
Bonus#2:Built for the United States military to calculate the paths of artillery shells. It was later used to make calculations for nuclear weapons research, weather prediction, and wind tunnel design.<br />
<br />
Source: Microsoft(I said the evil word, God have mercy!:lol:) Encarta<br />
<br />
If you count this as right starlifter then you are wrong I hate to say.(I am guessing since you said phillippe was close) Exact quote from article:&quot;Although it was the first large-scale machine to do routine calculations in a production environment, the ENIAC was not the first electronic computer. Between 1939 and 1942, John Atanasoff, a physics and mathematics professor at Iowa State University, and his graduate student Clifford Berry, assembled the Atanasoff-Berry Computer, which incorporated many digital circuit design innovations. Their system used the binary arithmetic system of 1s and 0s commonly used in today's computers as well as a memory drum that stored data in a method similar to the storage technique used in modern memory chips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 15, 2002, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good explanation, King of Camelot!<br />
<br />
There is some debate as to the first useful electronic computer, but I would have taken Colossus as well.  It was built no later than Dec 1943, and used  by the British to decode German Enigma messages.  Only a few photos still remain of the  Colossus machines; the British destroyed the machines and plans, and to this day, have never released the algorithms it employed.  Its computation speed was set by the speed of the sprocket drive of the long paper code containing a message to be decrypted... the paper wizzed at 30 miles per hour.  The Colossus actually figured, by brute force, the correct wheel settings for the British cypher machines to use to actually decrypt an entire German message.  It did not translate the code itself....  the Colossus was kept in such secrecy that it did not really influence modern computer design, like ENIAC did....<br />
<br />
The Atanasoff machine was a special purpose electromechanical machine for solving simultaneous equations... it could not be altered, and most people classify it into the other similar  machines developed in several places in the 1930's...  the basis for the claim some make for the first modern electronic computer is on the fact that some of the ENIAC patents were reversed in US court in the early 1970's because the ENIAC's inventor (can't recall his name) had briefly seen the Atanasoff device before the ENIAC was operational.  <br />
<br />
But the ENIAC is the most widely acknowledged 1st modern electronic computer, barring further revelations from the British gov't about Colossus.  Colossus was, BTW, the first Turing machine... the logic basis for digital computers of today.  <br />
<br />
PS, Philippe had a mix of the ENIAC and the Colossus description, which is why I said he was on the right track...  <br />
<br />
Nice job... your question!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, to KoC and SL, didn´t the rules state that this is a quiz of KNOWLEDGE, not of who can search the fastest on the web or in this case MS encarta??<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2002, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hehe... HTML, DHTML, XML... bring it on!!  Yeah, ask anything about computers you'd like when you get control of the question!!  :D</div></div><hr />

Yes, people should answer as best they can from knowledge &amp; school &amp; experience.   Questions should come from knowledge &amp; experience, too.  <br />
<br />
BTW, once a question is asked, answered (and the questioner provides a final statement), then anyone (including the questioner) may feel free to look it up and make a new post wth minor detail corrections, add useful info, etc.  (I'm going to search my question later today to  fill in the gaps [dates, names, etc.], if I get the time). <br />
<br />
PS, I'm looking over your shoulder again, Lucky, but I had some coffee in my hand and you beat me to the message this time....  hehe... and you thought I was only kidding about the camera I have that is watching you  :).<br />
<br />
Also, Lucky, you might have some ideas about general  &quot;HOWTOs&quot; that could help, e.g, similar to the HOWTOs that I've been writing &amp; putting up this morning (feel free to write/contribute any new HOWTOs you think can help with &quot;typical&quot; problems of CFC-ers!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I´m nowhere as good as you in writting neverending essays with so much information. ;)<br />
But you shouldn´t forget your quiz question at GC, just like you stated in the rules here, check in often.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2002, 01:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would like to ask for a change of rules. I don't like the no researching rule. I think that having people research the answer is a good way to get people to learn new things since it gets them involved versus testing other's knowledge and maybe picking up on something from what the knowlwdgable ones know. Besides all of this KoC broke it already and got to continue with the questioning....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lovro</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2002, 03:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">However, the quiz would then come down to &quot;who gets to read the question first&quot;, which would be no fun (pointing to disclaimer in signature).<br />
<br />
My idea would be to keep a pool of unanswered questions in the first post, and everyone who answers one of those questions gets to ask another one (that will take its place in the first post). This sounds good in theory, but would be limited by the spare time and will of the author of the first post...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2002, 06:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well about the rules, remember you can research to clarify or add good stuff later (after the question is answered)....<br />
<br />
But it really seems less fun if people just go find stuff on CDs, ref books, online, etc. even to come up with the questions.<br />
<br />
Of course, we all must learn what we know from somewhere, but should keep pretty much to what we know (or don't) for thinking of questions and writing answers.  Everyone should knock themselfs out to check the replies &amp; feel free to post more, after the questioner feels his/her question is answered right!<br />
<br />
I think the old Star Trek quizzes and the History Quiz are pretty much the same rules, right?<br />
<br />
PS, No one should feel intimidated not to tak a stab, esp. the new people and visitors.... jump on in &amp; no one will hack on you if your answer is not correct!<br />
<br />
Have fun, too :D...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2002, 07:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1.When did Bill Gates buy MS-DOS?(year)<br />
BonusA.What month?<br />
BonusB.What day?<br />
<br />
2.Where did he buy it?(State and City)<br />
<br />
3.What was the name of the company he bought it from?<br />
 <br />
<br />
Well, since no one has answered in over 2 days, I'll go ahead, since I just happen to know this stuff pretty well due to the legal issues.<br />
<br />
1.When did Bill Gates buy MS-DOS?(year)<br />
BonusA.What month?<br />
BonusB.What day?<br />
<br />
Trick Question....  he did not buy &quot;MSDOS&quot;, but he did rip off a guy who wrote a CP/M clone called QDOS, and wound up paying $75,000 for something MS did not write, but they licensed it to IBM!!  And while IBM was in stalled negotiations with DRI (Digital Research Incorporated)!!<br />
<br />
Patterson (first name = ??) got ripped off, and it reminds me of the &quot;purchase of Manhatan Island for $16&quot; type of deal, esp. in retrospect!!  IBM &amp; MS came to tems in mid 1981 (shortly before the PC launch in Nov 1981) when IBM &amp; DRI did not agree on a price for CP/M, and MS marketed &quot;MS-DOS&quot; to OEMs (people making BM PC clones), while IBM marketed &quot;PC-DOS&quot; with its PCs.  <br />
<br />
Kildall (DRI founder)  was hacked at Gates to his dying day, and years later, when MS illegally put the DR-DOS OS out of business (I still have DR &amp; all its upgrades to fix the MS sabotages of it, on original 5.25&quot; floppy), DRI filed a lawsuit (circa 1994 I think).  The DR-DOS case is still in Utah Federal Court.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.Where did he buy it?(State and City)<br />
<br />
Gate, Allen, and Patteson were from Seattle, and I'm sure it was Seattle, WA (where I live ;) ).<br />
<br />
<br />
3.What was the name of the company he bought it from?<br />
<br />
Well, if you're referring to Patterson's company, it was something like &quot;Seattle Software&quot;.  <br />
<br />
But the &quot;real&quot; owners of it, as Patterson was demonstrating in Byte Magazine when I was in college, were DRI.... it was a clone of CP/M.  The case is still cited in most MS antitrust documents, and in most Pending Lawsuits against MS (including the DR case for DR-DOS of the early 90's in Utah).  But the $50,000 (plus $25,000 for the original licensing fee) was paid to Patterson's company.<br />
<br />
So I say &quot;Seattle Software&quot;.  <br />
<br />
<br />
IMHO, MS should be ripped apart and restitution paid going all the way back... but some might just call it capitalist hardball, LOL...  :)<br />
<br />
This should be close....<br />
<br />
PS, I don't know the day of month, and will guess August as the month, based on milestone timing (November minus 4 = August).<br />
<br />
<br />

I see you are keeping the lets get those dirty bastards at MS alive! I hate MS too!:mad: Only prob is now almost all the games are made espically for Windoze! Oh... yeah your turn. Also where was DRI based? I think I heard of the name before but can't remember.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey! Stop accusing me! It was a honest mistake and now it is over!:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 18, 2002, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've looked some stuff up to check my details, and here are some corections:<br />
<br />
1.  Kildall was Gary Kildall, founder of DRI in 1976.  Gates visited Kildall in November of 1977, and  licenced the use of CP/M for $50,000 as the underlying OS for his BASIC, FORTRAN, and other languages development for the PC.  This was all 8-bit CPU stuff.<br />
<br />
2.  In July, 1980, IBM asked MS to develop BASIC, FORTRAN, COBOL for its upcoming 16-bit PC.<br />
<br />
3.  IBM still needed an operating system. DRI was already planning a 16-bit version of CP/M, called CP/M-86. Microsoft had obtained a preliminary version, but  had no right to sub-license.<br />
<br />
4.  From one court document, <br />
<br />
Microsoft moved quickly to &quot;design&quot; an operating system for IBM. Tim Paterson, a small  Seattle-based OEM named Seattle Computer Products, had already designed in April 1980 his own 16-bit  CP/M &quot;clone,&quot; i.e., it mirrored CP/M's function calls. He dubbed it QDOS -- Quick and Dirty Operating System. On January 6, 1981, Microsoft licensed QDOS (subsequently dubbed &quot;86-DOS&quot;) for $25,000 --  while obtaining a right to sub-license, and without disclosure of IBM's interest.  Exhibit 6 (License  Agreement). Just prior to launch of the IBM PC in August 1981, Microsoft decided to buy the product  outright. On July 27, 1981, Microsoft paid an additional $50,000 to Seattle Computer. Exhibit 7. Microsoft  had its DOS, without any original work of its own, for a total price of $75,000.  <br />
<br />
5.  So the actual company name was &quot;Seattle Computer Products&quot;, not my guess of &quot;Seattle Software&quot;  :).<br />
<br />
6.  Also, the PC was launched in August of 1981 :eek: .<br />
<br />
7.  I guess On July 27, 1981 is as good a date as any for Gates' &quot;acquisition&quot; of the OS that would be renamed &quot;MS-DOS&quot; when the PC came out.<br />
<br />
8.  BTW, another tidbit from court docuemtns:  Microsoft's own programmers have readily acknowledged what was done in cloning CP/M. Only two people at Microsoft worked on MS-DOS 1.0. One of them, Chris Peters, later testified when Seattle Computer Products sued Microsoft concerning the purchase of QDOS:  &quot;Again, from the programmer's point of view, MS-DOS 1.0 was a clone of CP/M.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, time for a new question.<br />
<br />
Here is an easy one:<br />
<br />
What do the following computer-related acronyms stand for:<br />
<br />
software<br />
BASIC<br />
APL<br />
COBOL<br />
FORTRAN<br />
PCDOS<br />
CP/M<br />
BIOS<br />
<br />
hardware<br />
CPU<br />
CDROM<br />
RAM<br />

Several variants emerged, the most popular being &quot;Beginner's All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code&quot;.<br />
<br />
Similiarly, apparently IBM once tried to tell people that the term BYTE stood for &quot;Binary-Yoked Table Entity&quot; or some such nonsense, presumably because they couldn't handle the idea of such a serious term having sprung from humour.

MIT didn't have a damn thing to do with the creation of the internet/ARPAnet.  It was three Universities in the western states:  Stanford, UCLA, and the University of Utah (my school).<br />
<br />
Excerpt from:  http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/A/ARPANET.html<br />
  <br />
The precursor to the Internet, ARPANET was a large wide-area network created by the United States Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA). Established in 1969, ARPANET served as a testbed for new networking technologies, linking many universities and research centers. The first two nodes that formed the ARPANET were UCLA and the Stanford Research Institute, followed shortly thereafter by the University of Utah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I have not provided anything of value as yet to establish my standing in this 'community', I cannot stand silent any longer in the face of the personal affont against me by &quot;Filleep&quot;.<br />
. I have held back til now out of respect for the friendship that Pesoloco has shown to him.<br />
. He has wasted that 'community value' by repeatedly proving himself to be an Arrogant Moron. <br />
. No one believes he is really only fourteen or fifteen years old, yet anyone can be convinced that he is limited by a sophmoric mental developement. That, coupled with the audacity to presume that His Word is sufficient to quiet any voice he deems &quot;Annoying&quot; puts him right on the line for the definition of Psycopathy.<br />
Point One: &quot;Filleep&quot; does not know the proper use of simple common terms such as &quot;Spam&quot;, as used on the Internet. Conclusion: He is a Moron.<br />
Point Two: &quot;Filleep&quot; can't provide anything of more value to the community than the seeping pustulant excreta from his oral sphincter. Raise your hand, please if your life was enhanced by the knowledge of which mayonnaise he preferred, or any of the other 1853 drool samples he has graced us with. Hmmm, no hands? why not? Which brings up:<br />
Point Three: Diety? Now, ~that~ is hubris! Does voluminous output = Godliness? Then there is a bull I'd like to show you, because his pen is hip-deep with 'Output'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">suchomimus</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2002, 03:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Conclusion? The Voice of the community is the one that matters most here. Is &quot;Filleep&quot; an Arrogant Moron, or is &quot;Sooky&quot; a (oh! the shame!) &quot;Spammer&quot;?<br />
.<br />
Or, (C), Does anyone care?<br />
.<br />
That is the major issue, and related to general good behavior on the Internet. 'Netiquette' has long ago established that 'Flaming' is not much fun for any but those engaged in it, thus, generally bad behavior. <br />
Do Not Insult Others. No one wants to hear that they are 'annoying', or a 'poopiehead'.<br />
Know Your Limits. If you are a child or a Newbie, don't go to the deep end of the pool. There is always another Netizen who is more easily insulted than you, and they may also be more vicious in their retribution, with DoS, backdoor entry, 'social engineering' and other techniques that will leave the young newbie wondering why he can't boot his 'puter anymore.<br />
There is also always someone more stoopider, but if they approach with a reasonable measure of humilty, they may be able to get good advice and encouragement from those more experienced.</div></div><hr />

Years ago when computing was primarely about hardware and the rest came next IBM was by far the biggest.

<br />
The company is DEC or Digital Equipment Corporation, as guessed by KaeptnOvi, its founder and one of the greatest IBM haters ever is Ken Olsen who founded DEC in 1957.<br />
<br />
It was the first computer company big in size that wasn't an IBM look-alike. Best known products are the PDP and Vax series which were used mainly in non-admin environments. I made my first CAD drawing on a PDP-8 in 1985 or so (64k memory).<br />
<br />
DEC was eventually crushed between Intel-based servers and Sun / HP servers and was acquired by Compaq.<br />
<br />
Since KaeptnOvi got the name right next question is for him.</div></div><hr />

That´s why I didn´t want to answer yesterday (and it was also more like today 3am when I read it first ;)).<br />
<br />
Here goes:<br />
<br />
A tristate gate is a logical unit which has an output line that can achieve 3 different states. High, low (binary 1 and 0) and the tristate itself, which switched the gate to a high-impedance state, therefore disabling it.<br />
This third state is achieved by another input line, the CE (chip enable) line. If this line is set to low, then the chip is disabled, therefore not fulfilling it´s logical operations.<br />
In a bus system this is used to enable access for one client only, since the bus can only transmit data from 1 point to another. :yeah:<br />
<br />
That should be enough for the basics.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
wow, that was much more detailed than I was looking for. All I wanted was that it is for example used for DMA (Direct Memory Access) bypass the CPU. But you want to do it perfect, ok, fine by me :D<br />
<br />
Your turn<br />
<br />
By the way what is CS (I imagine you're not referring to counter-strike here, and I think EE stands for Electo Engineering (sp?), but I can't find an explanation for CS other than Chip Select which seems not to be applicable here)</div></div><hr />

You have described a complete cycle, without naming it, but each step here is a seperate cycle in itself, with another global name. And those are still made up of even smaller steps, the last name I want.<br />
So Name those 3 divisions/subdivisions that make up one CPU instruction!<br />
<br />
Try again.<br />

I think he means things like; even though you have an OP code it needs to be decoded before the correct action can proceed. Different generations of processors have different considerations when executing code so you can get into wait states and UV pipes depending on even how the code was originally compiled.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jul 05, 2002, 10:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All micro processors use the same division of steps and cycles that make up one complete instruction. An example of one instruction would be &quot;Write data to memory&quot;.<br />
<br />
There are 3 divisions of every instruction in every processor that I want! :yeah:<br />
<br />
The smallest division of all cycles is the clock of the CPU.<br />
Now I want the name of:<br />
<br />
1. The smallest step (equal to one or two clock steps in most CPUs)<br />
2. The smallest cycle (made up of the steps above, describes a subinstruction, complete in itself, one example would be &quot;Get OP-code from memory&quot;)<br />
3. The complete cycle of one CPU command (should be obvious)!<br />
<br />
After easing this up a little, I also have a bonus question:<br />
What is the cycle &quot;Get OP-code from memory!&quot; called?<br />
<br />
As a cycle of the 2nd type, it´s name will also most likely reveal the name of that type.<br />

<br />
Here is the answer:<br />
1. T-state - smallest step of CPU work, 1 or 2 clock steps, depending on CPU type<br />
<br />
2. machine cycle (M-cycle) - describes a complete sub-instruction, e.g. &quot;set interrupt&quot;, made up of several T-states<br />
<br />
3. instruction cycle - a complete CPU instruction, includes several machine cycles<br />
<br />
Now as an amendment to this question, I´ll ask the next one.<br />
<br />
Name at least 5 examples of basic machine cycles (excluding the one above)!<br />
EVERY CPU instruction starts with the same machine cycle. Name it!<br />
<br />
HINT: The answer for the second question was already mentioned!<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitro</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, I tried to remember my Technical Computer Science I course (for the original question), but I had severe translation problems I guess.<br />
Could you (Lucky) answer two questions, please?<br />
1. Translate the three terms into German. :D<br />
2. Are you talking about RISC, CISC or both architectures?<br />
<br />
I know the following levels:<br />
- Machine code<br />
- Pseudo-commands (like &quot;add&quot;)<br />
- Instructions (like &quot;add $t1, $t2, $t1)<br />
<br />
Maybe I should add that I learned that on the examle of a MIPS R2000 simulator. And maybe I should also add that I forgot most of that course. :lol:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The translation was the bigger problem for me, too, but I compared with some native English introductions to CPU architecture and it was similar or even equally explained there. :yeah:<br />
<br />
to 1.  <br />
1. T-Zustand - kleinster Operationsschritt der CPU<br />
2. M-Zyklus, Maschinenzyklus, Operationszyklus - eine Teiloperation eines Befehls<br />
3. Befehlszyklus - Zeitspanne für die Abarbeitung eines kompletten Befehls<br />
<br />
to 2.<br />
Well, RISC architecture is more or less a downgrade from the CISC (hence &quot;reduced instruction set computer&quot;). But the basic division would stay the same, RISC computers also work an the basis of a clock, have partial operations (sub-instructions), etc. But the RISC architecture allows more than that.<br />
BUT I was talking generally about a CPU, as used in PCs and other computer, therefore about CISC architecture. Microprocessors using RISC architecture are not generally referred to as CPUs, this name was &quot;invented&quot; for PCs and workstations.<br />
So the answer would be BOTH, but specifically for CISC architecture.<br />
<br />
<br />
The levels you mention are programming levels, I wanted the actual hardware levels (cycles) of the CPU. The steps it goes through when processing one instruction, which can be written in machine code, pseudo code or any higher programming language.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

I already posted a new one! And the old one was only 4 days old, with several answers posted.<br />
I´m sorry if that´s too hard for you, but only software questions all the time are boring. :p<br />
<br />
Here is the current question again:<br />
Name at least 5 examples of basic machine cycles (e.g. &quot;set interrupt&quot;)!<br />
EVERY CPU instruction starts with the same machine cycle. Name it!<br />
<br />
Several machine cycles have been named already, especially the one that´s always the first.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitro</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the first is the &quot;Get OP-code from memory&quot; that you already mentioned.<br />
Others are (I think) &quot;Get value from register in memory&quot;, &quot;add&quot;, &quot;break if equal&quot;, &quot;jump register&quot;, or &quot;load byte&quot;<br />
<br />
But I'm still not sure what you mean. Do you mean things like above or the actual procession cycle in the CPU? Like &quot;the program counter does...&quot; or &quot;then the MBR...&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the new question I just want the names of an actual machine cycle.<br />
<br />
&quot;Get OP-code from memory&quot; is always the first cycle, the M1-cycle. Correct!<br />
<br />
&quot;Read from memory&quot; would be another machine cycle.<br />
<br />
ADD would be an instruction, as it is composed of several machine cycles. Break... too, jump also and load too.<br />
<br />
Those you mentioned last are assembler commands or machine code commands. The resemble a complete instruction. But they all need several basic steps to achieve their goal.<br />
<br />
In a CPU you have several command lines, write (WR), read (RD), interrupt (INT), memoryrequest (MREQ), I/O-request (IORQ), wait, the data bus, the address bus and a few others.<br />
They are set to low or high to show what the CPU is currently doing. For example, let´s say the value '5' lies at the data bus and a certain memory adress at the address bus. And we want to write the '5' to memory, so we have to set MREQ to high (we want access to the memory and when we set WR to high, too, the data is written to the memory, at the address specified.<br />
Such a cycle would be 1 machine cycle. I want the name for this (easy) and others.<br />
<br />
We need to remember that all memory and all IO-units are on the same bus. Interrupts are needed to coordinate the communication.<br />
<br />
Now let´s just say we want the CPU to read a value from memory and print that value to an I/O-device.<br />
For such an instruction, we need <br />
1. OP-code fetch cycle (M1-cycle)    (already mentioned)<br />
2. &quot;Read value from memory&quot; cycle (mentioned)<br />
3. ...<br />
4. ...<br />
<br />
Now what could be 3. and 4.? First we need to tell the I/O-device that we have data for it and then we have to send it. What would be the machine cycles needed?<br />
And what would be other ones?<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hitro</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah thanks, now I at least know what you are talking about. :)<br />
<br />
And the example you gave (of reading and printing) was actually a question on a worksheet I had to do once. But unfortunately I had already decided to switch to math at that point and therefore only learned for the oral exam, passed it and forgot most. :D<br />
I remember though, that we didn't use the cycles but had to give every single action, like &quot;setting high the data bus&quot;, &quot;setting low the address bus&quot;. In other words: a communication protocol.<br />
<br />
I could easily look it up but that wouldn't be in the spirit of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2002, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the cycle names are rather descriptive, and the ones missing also rather easy to derive. I already more or less wrote what those machine cycles would have to do, all you need is a descriptive name for it. :yeah:<br />
<br />
A sidenote: There are much more than 4 steps required for the actual instruction. Those are only the 4 basic steps. For example before the interrupt can be processed, you have to load the number of the specific interrupt routine into a certain register in memory. Then, during the interrupt, several other machine cycles are used, for example to save the state before the interrupt into memory.<br />
<br />
<br />
So now everything is more or less said, only someone to write down a name for step 3 and 4 and maybe derive others from that is needed.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
And for the 4th a name would be &quot;Write to I/O&quot;.<br />
As I said, rather descriptive.<br />
The main machine cycles are:<br />
<br />
M1-cycle - fetch OP-code from memory<br />
Memory write cycle<br />
Memory read cycle<br />
I/O write cycle<br />
I/O read cycle<br />
WAIT-cycle<br />
maskable interrupt (INT) cycle<br />
not-maskable (NMI) cycle<br />
<br />
and others.<br />
So, for example, the instruction &quot;Write data to memory&quot; would require a M1-cycle and a memory write cycle.<br />

startlifter, you are very knowledgeable about computers. But actually an &quot;acronym&quot; is a special kind of abbreviation. RADAR is an acronym because you pronounce it like it looks.

&quot;Get OP-code from memory&quot; is always the first cycle, the M1-cycle. Correct!<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think it's quite that simple any more. Modern cpus prefetch chunks of memory containing instructions and try to decode some things in advance, and can decode multiple possible instruction paths in parallel.<br />
<br />
Of course, you do have to get the instructions from memory, but they don't always process instructions sequentially. That is, they might be processing the opcode on one instruction, fetching a memory operand for another, and performing an immediate operation like shifting on another, all simultaneously.</div></div><hr />

2.  Who built the first working computer?<br />

1. I guess the conventional answer would be Babbage. But I could throw out names like Jaquard, Von Neumann too.<br />

startlifter, you are very knowledgeable about computers. But actually an &quot;acronym&quot; is a special kind of abbreviation. RADAR is an acronym because you pronounce it like it looks. IBM is an abbreviation, not an acronym. (Although there is a kind of IBM acronym used in a joke I heard in Spanish in Mexico. In Spanish the letters IBM sound like &quot;Y ve me&quot; as in &quot;Y ve me a traer una cerveza...&quot;). <br />
<br />
I have heard the word &quot;acronym&quot; used very often in the way you do. Maybe that will become a meaning of the word if enough people use it that way...<br />
<br />
;) ;) ;) <br />
<br />
This is a bit OT ;) <br />
<br />
But I must disagree - somewhat! IBM is an acronym!   An abbreviation is a word that has been shortened, by removing letters.  Eg. Doesn't is an abbreviated version of does not.  An acronynm is where the first (usually) letters of several words are used to represent the other words.  IBM is an acronym for International Business Machines.  Because letters have been removed from the whole, it is an abbreviation, but it is still and acronym as well. :)</div></div><hr />

His question was kindof too general, as there is a great deal of &quot;debate&quot; about what is the best/first/actual etc. computer.  Depending on how one &quot;defines&quot; computer (e.g., electical, electronic, mechanical, programmable, electrically programmable, etc. etc. we can both easily be way off of what he's looking for.  But if he takes my answer, I'll pass it on to you, and you can ask your question.   The real fun for me is reading the questions and answers you guys come up with!!  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you'll have to give us a hint, narrowing down what you're looking for.  As I recall, the Harvard Mark I was about 500 times slower that ENIAC.  But many people consider the Mark I a calculator, and not a computer, and I'm in league with them.<br />
<br />
I personally consider Babbage's Analytical Engine the first true computer ever designed, though obviously it is neither electronic nor electromechanical.  In fact, it was never fully built.<br />
As far as I'm personally concerned, even though it was very specialized, I consider the Brit's electro-mechanical marvel of Colossus to be the 1st modern working computer, despite the storage and transport medium.<br />
<br />
Sooo...... maybe you can describe what you view as the definition of computer, e.g., mechanical, electronic, electro-mechanical, programmable, etc.  <br />

  As to Babbage, that's why I said &quot;designed&quot; rather than &quot;built&quot; in my question, as the Analytical Engine never left paper.  Also the reason I didn't use words like &quot;electronic&quot;, etc.  You did note that I said Babbage was correct, yes?<br />

a computer using binary arithmetic.  But instead of vacuum tubes,<br />
he used telephone switches for bits.  The switches were, as <br />
stated previously, reliable, but slow (~3 sec. for multiplications).<br />
He and a friend attempted to get funding from the German government for a fully electronic computer, but were turned down<br />
on the grounds that the war wasn't going to last long enough to justify such a long term investment (IIRC late 1940).<br />

Protocols? <br />
<br />
Correct. This was my intended post but the connection on the Mekong was slow and I didn't have my computer there:<br />
<br />
There are 3 questions here. The first should be the easiest, the second a little harder, and the 3rd  very  difficult. In fact, you can ignore the third question entirely, and answer/not answer any of the questions. The 2nd and third questions are tie breakers.<br />
<br />
[list]<br />
<br />
  1. To ease the effort to program computers, what we call computer &quot;languages&quot; appeared. Examples are Intel, 68000, etc. assembler language, C, FORTRAN, JAVA, etc. But these are not analogous to human languages. Whaat we call a computer &quot;language&quot; is a collection of mnemonics (words) used to control a computer. Human languages, on the other hand, are 2-way and have many more uses than just telling a person what to do. <br />
<br />
There are &quot;languages&quot; by which computers can &quot;talk&quot; to each other. Examples are TCP/IP, NETBIOS, Appletalk, IPX, and Bill G's favorite, SMB/CIFS.<br />
<br />
Question: What is the common term for  all  these &quot;languages&quot;?<br />
<br />
  2. What is a &quot;Sniffer&quot;?<br />
<br />
  3. (Warning, this is a tough one and it's not related to the first 2!) The Intel 386 (80386) processor had a bug in one of its instructions. The &quot;pop flags&quot; instruction (popf) sometimes allowed interrupts to be enabled during the execution of itself, even if interrupts were disabled before and after the instruction executed. This was a very nasty bug which caused &quot;protected&quot; blocks of code to be non-atomic. I don't know who it was, but somebody found a way to restore flags without enabling interrupts. This instruction sequence replaced  only  the popf instruction.<br />
<br />
Question: What was the instruction sequence used as a workaround instead of the popf instruction? <br />
<br />
starlifter, have already answered #1 correctly. You can either post a new question or try to answer #2 and/or #3. Up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jul 14, 2002, 07:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2. What is a &quot;Sniffer&quot;? <br />
A sniffer is a software that monitor network packets, and identifies certain patterns, typically addresses, that pass.  <br />
<br />
Question: What was the instruction sequence used as a workaround instead of the popf instruction?  <br />
Don't know, but a guess would be a NOP.  I still have an original 486 that was defective.  I never had it replaced following the 486 defect mess.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My question:<br />
<br />
You've heard of an atomic clock, but what is a dot clock?  That is, what does the term mean, and what affects it?   And what 2 pieces of hardware are most affected by the dot clock?  Why is it  important to your eyes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks starlifter. A Sniffer is one example of a protocol analyzer. Also called network monitor, as you said. Suppose you have a problem between client and a server but you don't know which machine the problem occurs on. By using a protocol analyzer you can often see which machine has the problem and thereby cut your debug time dramatically.<br />
<br />
This is the answer for question #3. <br />
<br />
the cli (clear interrupts) flag protects a critical code section, for example, inside a semaphore. You have a routine that has such a critical section, but you don't know if the routine that called your routine already disabled interrupts. On the 286, people used to do this<br />
<br />
pushf (push the flags register, including the interrupt flag)<br />
<br />
cli (disable interrupts)<br />
<br />
.... (critical section)<br />
<br />
popf (pop the flags register. now I have restored the interrupt state that was in effect before the pushf.<br />
<br />
However, the 386 had a bug in the popf that allowed an interrupt to occur, and this caused much wailing and gnashing of teeth.<br />
<br />
 solution - replace popf with:<br />
<br />
push cs<br />
<br />
push ip<br />
<br />
iret (interrupt return - pops ip, cs, and flags in one instruction)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OK, now back to your question....</div></div><hr />

Outstanding definition!!  That is indeed the formal definition, and I myself would probably not have been able to phrase it that well.<br />
<br />
What I'm looking for is <br />
<br />
2.  Some plain words for the other parts, the intent being to explain the use of this in the real world, e.g., with respect to the &quot;bandwidth&quot; rating on your monitor (people probably notice that in general, monitor with higher Bandwidth cost more... until recent years, mucho mucho more dinero).  <br />
<br />
3.  How is the dot clock related mathematically to things like vertical refresh, resolution, etc.  (the usual &quot;hype&quot; among comteting monitors!)...<br />
<br />
4.  What are the names of the 2 pieces of hardware affected/related  with the dot clock?<br />
<br />
5.  Also, how can dot clock relate to your eyesight when using a CRT, in particular.<br />
<br />
<br />
None of the above are trick questions (don't try to outthink them).... I just like to make sure non-techies can gain something &quot;real world&quot; out of my questions (at least most of them ;) )</div></div><hr />

<br />
# of dots:  (vertical * horizontal) visible pixels (dots)<br />
<br />
Required dot clock is actual Vertical * Horizontal pixes (this includes the unseen, off screen dot scanning).<br />
<br />
<br />
Dot Clock = (actual V) * (actual H) * (refresh rate)<br />
<br />
e.g., for 800 resolution @ 100Hz:<br />
<br />
(600+unseen) * (800+unseen) * 100 = over 48,000,000, or over 48MHz bandwidth.<br />
<br />
So you probably need a monitor with excess of 50 MHz bandwidth to display 800x600 at 100Hz.   The more bandwidth, the higher combos of resolution and refresh you can do.<br />
<br />
There is always an unseen part of the scan, BTW.... <br />
<br />
<br />
OK, so that's pretty much parts 2 &amp; 3, leaving the easy parts of 4 &amp; 5 .  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
4.:   The two main peices of hardware are the Video Card and the Monitor.<br />
<br />
5. :  At higher Dot Clock rates, you can have finer resolutions and higher refresh rates, both of which are easier on your eyes, esp. with CRTs (tubes, as opposed to flat screen LCD/TFTs).<br />

However, knowing a bit about the industry from &quot;inside&quot;, I can say that date will slip to the right (e.g., be delayed).  The original target was 2002, but they are having lots of problems with scaling up their database to control the entire world's computers.  Everyone that is part of the MSN is part of the MS effort to work out those technical problems (whether MSN users are aware of it or not).  :(<br />

Ok, since I couldn't think of anything better I'll ask you some acronyms (again) of course all related to computers:<br />
<br />
What are:<br />
HAL<br />
RIMM<br />
GPU<br />
ADSL<br />
API<br />
ALU<br />
CMOS<br />
DAC<br />
SMTP<br />
SNMP<br />
<br />
Ok, that's enough for now.</div></div><hr />

HAL is the Hardware Abstraction Layer.  NTx uses the HAL to communicate with the specific hardware on your machine.</div></div><hr />

;)<br />
SMTP-servers are still used for outbound mail, whereas pop3 usually takes care of inbound mail.<br />
<br />
Your question, hopefully a little more creative than mine :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jul 24, 2002, 02:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">66 MHz.   I don't know about the particular CPU, but the Bus will be 66.7 with an 8x CPU multiplier for the 533 CPU speed.  in most Motherboards, this can be set by jumper; but some, use BIOS settings to make it even easier.<br />
<br />
The PCI bus speed (if you meant this bus) is 33 MHz.</div></div><hr />

I've never seen it definitively printed as an actual acronym, and my gut feel is that they wanted something pronounceable in the film.

Well, I´ll just do that now. :p<br />
<br />
Where was IRC first used? What was the first IRC network? What happened to that more or less only IRC network in the early ´90s? And what are the 4 main IRC networks today? And which is the leading one in number of users?<br />
<br />
Lot´s of question, but they are one topic, so I asked them together.<br />
Let´s see if someone knows this all from memory, shouldn´t be too hard.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jul 24, 2002, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">hmmm.... I've used a program called mIRC a long time ago, briefly.   I recall EFnet, DALnet, IRCnet and something else.  I have no idea about the development of IRC.  My guess is the IRCnet is the biggest, as it makes sense from the name.  When I logged on, it was to connect to a gamesnet server.  I was never an IRC person, so someone else can fill in the details :).</div></div><hr />

 Arthur C. Clarke, who wrote the novel version of 2001,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Aug 02, 2002, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, here are the answers:<br />
<br />
Where was IRC first used? - Developed and first used at the Finish university of Oulu by Jarkko Oikarinen.<br />
<br />
What was the first IRC network? - IRC (;)), later called EFnet<br />
<br />
What happened to that more or less only IRC network in the early ´90s? - In 1995/6 the original IRC network split up into EFnet and IRCnet. A bit later, Undernet and DALnet were also founded.<br />
<br />
And what are the 4 main IRC networks today? And which is the leading one in number of users? -<br />
EFnet, IRCnet, DALnet, Undernet -- DALnet is the current leader in number of users, with over 100,000 users online at the same time.<br />
<br />
That´s it. :yeah:<br />
<br />
Ok, new question, some acronyms for you to decipher. They are of a somewhat more technical nature, though. All play a major part in a fully functioning PC of today.  <br />
<br />
DRAM <br />
EEPROM <br />
INT <br />
IRQ <br />
NMI <br />
PPI (*) <br />
PIC (*) <br />
PIT (*) <br />
SRAM <br />
UART (*) <br />
USART (*)Decipher and try to give a few words of explanation! <br />
For those marked with a (*), try to name the chip (usually Intel) used in the standard IBM PC! (bonus)<br />
<br />
All acronyms are hardware related, nothing about software (so INT is not integer).<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm.... Well, I'll wait a day or so to see if anyone gets them; I'll then answer whatever is leftover, since I should know them ;).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Aug 05, 2002, 03:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, no! :p<br />
<br />
Sorry, last time I took away the answers at GC. But nobody had all correct answers there, so I thought it would be better to list them, maybe someone learns something. ;)<br />
Anyway, only a small few of you go to GC, but there are many others. So start trying!<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Aug 16, 2002, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm, didn´t think this to be too hard, probably no one is interested, though. :p<br />
Anyway:<br />
<br />
DRAM - Dynamic Random Access Memory (standard RAM chip, needs to be refreshed)<br />
EEPROM - Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (program memory, often used for storing the BIOS, also referred to as flash memory)<br />
INT - hardware INTerrupt (from interrupt controller to CPU)<br />
IRQ - Interrupt ReQuest (peripheral interrupt line to interrupt controller, maskable (gives different priorities))<br />
NMI - Non Maskable Interrupt (interrupt which immediatly stops the CPU process, e.g. power OFF)<br />
PPI - Programmable Peripheral Interface (parallel port of the comp (LPT), e.g. PPI 8255)<br />
PIC - Programmable Interrupt Controller (stores the vectors that point to the specific interrupt service routine of the periphery and gives different priorities to the different IRQs, e.g. PIC 8259) <br />
PIT - Programmable Interval Timer (for setting different clock speeds, e.g. setting a baud rate for the mouse or other serial periphery, e.g. PIT 8253)<br />
SRAM - Static RAM (no refresh -&gt; faster access times, but less capacity and much more expensive, e.g. CACHE memory)<br />
UART - Universal Asynchronous Receiver / Transmitter (serial port (COM), e.g. UART 8250 (not Intel))<br />
USART - Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver / Transmitter (also a serial port but with extra clock for synchronous mode, e.g. USART 8251)<br />
<br />
Much more info than I wanted, so the answers weren´t really that hard for anyone who ever took a closer look at a computer mainboard!<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;accuracy&quot; actually depends on whether the number is negative or positive. A single is approximately ±1e-46, and a double is approximately ±1e-300-ish.</div></div><hr />

  I probably *did* phrase things too vaguely...  What I want<br />
 to know is the number of bits of precision for both<br />
mantissa and exponent in single and double precision floating point numbers which use the IEEE-754 floating point format.<br />
