Well, thoughts?  These are just proposed, the cheapest ones available.  Seeing as we're in a war, and unit upgrades need consideration, none of these may be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2003, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see no direct need for either Philosophy or Mapmaking. <br />
<br />
Philosophy: This leads to Republic, a very useful government, but the people decided (very closely) to go for Monarchy.<br />
<br />
Mapmaking: This has 2 uses; harbors and the Great Lighthouse. We have 1 or 2 (Inadatto and maybe lake Asphinxia) coastal cities out of 10 cities. That's not enough to make harbors very needed. There are no Civs building the great Lighthouse but they will be very soon (see my analysis here (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=55439)).  <br />
<br />
Another use may not be overlooked; can we sell them at a profit? All 3 civs on our land we are not at war with already have both. These techs cannot be sold. <br />
<br />
I am not saying these techs are not needed, but we have little gain here and we have more pressing matters now. The longer we wait, the cheaper they become. I say: NO, we shouldn't do this now!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let us use our treasury to ensure a quick decisive war against Egypt, after which we can enjoy a period of commercial growth with the help of our newly gained cities.</div></div><hr />

That's why I responded nautral, without suggesting you were against it or supportive of it.</div></div><hr />

Oops!  My bad, Octavian.  In all honesty, I did not see your final sentence.  I was merely weighing in on the matter, and certainly did not mean to imply that you were wasting your time by discussing these options.  I just really want those Warriors upgraded.  ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep up the good work!</div></div><hr />
