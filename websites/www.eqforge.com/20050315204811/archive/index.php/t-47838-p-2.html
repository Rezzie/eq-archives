The initial screen has two check-boxes, both for versions of PTW.  Use SHIFT-click to turn the check mark off in both boxes - that way it will run for the Civ3 version 1.29f (gold edition).</div></div><hr />

I never saw version 1.27f, only Civ3 1.21f and the next was 1.29f<br />

Thanks CCJ39, but the version i have(the gold edition) is a combination of both Ptw and Civ 3, so i can't really choose  between both. Once again I appreciate your help. <br />
<br />
My understanding was that Civ3 Gold was Civ3 with all the patches applied - I just looked at the Civ3 web site and read the blurb, and it says Civ3 Gold is Civilization 3 with the Play the World muliplayer expansion pack.<br />
<br />
Did they give you 2 CD's, one labelled Civilization 3 and the other labelled Play the World?  If they did and you install both, you'll have two games - Civ3 (Civilization3.exe) and Play the World (Civilization3x.exe).  I assume Civ3 is at version 1.29f and PTW is at version 1.27f, but might still be at version 1.21f.  The initial screen for each program shows the version in the lower left hand corner of the screen.<br />
<br />
So check which program executable you are starting up when you play the game, and notice the patch level on the initial screen, and start up Powerbar with the appropriate version option.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!  (I infer from reading other things in the CFC forum that the Gold Edition didn't come with a manual, so I can understand the confusion!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might want to 'search' for civ3.exe.  For those of us who originally bought Civ3 and then added PTW, the executables are in different folders.  Personally speaking, though, I NEVER play the 'orignal' CIV3 (civ3.exe) since I got PTW (civ3x.exe).  <br />
<br />
(Given the directory structures for Civ3 and PTW, I doubt that they combined Civ3 and PTW into one executable.)<br />
<br />
Please let us know if using Powerbar with the option for PTW version 1.27f works for you,</div></div><hr />

was civ3x.exe, it seems like there is no sign of Civ 3 and PTW <br />

Multiplayer was Civ3 assumingly with all the patches applied plus <br />

Play the World muliplayer expansion. This might help, the box <br />

1.27f, A little recap : <br />
<br />
- using Civilization 3 Gold Edition Multiplayer version 1.27f <br />
  (North American)<br />
<br />
- using Windows 2000, 1.9GHZ, cpu usage is about 25% when game and powerbar are running<br />
<br />
- Problem with powerbar for me, when load button is clicked after the saved game is loaded, there is no response, progress bar does not change colour, even after waiting for long periods of time there is still no response, still able to play the game while powerbar says it's loading.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks Jeannie. And thanks to all who have given suggestions.</div></div><hr />

I DO plan on updating powerbar, but I have yet to buy the new Conquests... :crazyeye: <br />

Stay tuned - I'll try to get to it soon! <br />
<br />
Hey, Rhye and Mertic, try reading through the thread before asking questions that have been answered.  It makes for less repetitive/pointless posts in the thread.  Thanks.<br />
<br />
For all those who are eagerly awaiting a new C3C compatible PowerBar:<br />
Is anybody down with pitching in and helping SpiderZord (who works on/uploads PowerBar with his own time and expense) get a copy of Conquests?  It would be a nice gesture from those who have used his program to tweak around with Civ3.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Simple fix. Start the PowerBar.exe.  Select the version you are playing. Press Continue.  Now, start Civ III. Start or load a game. Wait until the game is fully loaded/started THEN press the LOAD button on PowerBar. If you do not wait until the Civ III game loads/starts to press LOAD, then powerbar will hang. <br />
<br />
Do not press LOAD prior to starting Civ II or at the splash screen!!<br />

<br />
I'm getting the Run-time error: '399' Component 'MSCOMCTL.OCX' or one of it's dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid.<br />
<br />
The problem is that I don't have that file at all. And I have no idea where to download it.<br />
<br />
The only fix I've so far found is one for properly registering the file. <br />
<br />
But I don't have the file, so that won't work.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nexushyper</div><div class="date">Dec 10, 2003, 02:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, go to this site (http://www.geocities.com/nitin_speed/resources.htm#mscomctl)  and download the .OCX file you are missing. The link should take you right to the download page. It also includes, on that page, the instructions of where to place the file, and how to &quot;registry&quot; the file with the Windows Registry so that you can use it.  That should fix your problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
NOTE: You may wish to bookmark that page as it has alot of the 'common' missing .dlls and .ocxs that are needed for Visual Basic programs like Powerbar.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work let me know as I have all the VB needed files and can e-mail them to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roanish</div><div class="date">Dec 11, 2003, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have CivIII Gold myself, and from what I have read in this thread is that everyone using the &quot;Gold&quot; version is having problems with the PB.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Gold&quot; is not CivIII, nor is it PTW.  It seems to be it's own integrated program.  You can not sellect to play one or the other.  There is no CivIII disc in the package.  There is no PTW disc.  When I try to open just the CivIII file, it asks to put in the CivIII disc which of course, I do not have. <br />
<br />
I have tried all the suggestions for using the PB with &quot;Gold&quot; and have had no luck.  <br />
1. Waited for a saved game to load before hitting the &quot;load&quot; button.<br />
2. Started a new game and took a turn before hitting the &quot;load&quot; button.<br />
3. Tried both of the above with box 1.27f and box 1.21 checked, also tried it with none of them checked.<br />
<br />
Whatever I have tried has resulted in the PB hanging at the &quot;loading&quot; point.<br />
<br />
&quot;Extreme&quot; was having the same issue and from what I could tell, and is also using &quot;Gold&quot;.  A couple threads later he comments that he has figured it out.  Extreme are you referring to the problem of the PB hanging?  If so, and you have figured it out, could you share what you know with the rest of us please?<br />

3.6 is the only working version currently.  If you have Civ III Gold Edition, or Conquests it will not work for those. It will work for Civ III all patches, Civ III PTW 1.21 and 1.27.  SpiderZord is working on this I am sure, but does NOT get paid for this free service so when he gets time (As he has a family with kids and a life from what I can tell) he will update it.  Please be patient and respect the man for all he has done for the Civ III community, I'm sure he will get an update out.<br />
<br />
<br />
@SpiderZord:<br />
I program in VB6.0 myself, and am getting better ever day (since I code everyday, I need to get good to do it for a living) I bring this up because I know you are busy! If you want help, or need to turn the project over to someone else to work on, I'd be glad to help out.  You'll have to teach me a few things with the memory offsets, etc, but I learn very fast! Alo, if you do hand this over to me (Even just temp till you have time to do this again) I'd like people to know I do have a job, and a wife, and will work on it when I can and do what I can.  However, I have no kids, and prolly have a bit more free time then SpiderZord has.<br />
<br />
Just an offer SpiderZord.  I love to code, I love to help out, and I love PowerBar!</div></div><hr />

I think Power Bar is a great tool, but you need to examine the functionality of the new versions before you adopt them. It also does not make sense to me to overwrite proven versions of Power Bar with beta revisions that may or may not work.<br />
<br />
I am running Civ III version 1.29f and I haven't had any luck with any of the Power Bar revisions since 2.1.0. Therefore, that is the revision that I use.<br />

What is needed, for those who do not have a revision library, is an online revision library.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so, Spiderzord takes his time to build us this wonderful util. and you now say that he shouldnt have taken the job because he doesnt have the time to upgrade it when you want it?<br />
<br />
yes.. we all want this to be compatible with conquests, but acting like an ass and demanding things is no way to get anything. if and when he gets the time, im sure it will be upgraded. til then... wait, like everyone else.<br />
<br />
better yet, i can decompile the source if you want and then you can add the rest of the code and make it compatible with conquests?</div></div><hr />

SpidarZord not only has been gracious with his time and effort, he paid for the code and has done a great job with updates.  <br />
<br />
Conquests has had 3 updates with another in the works and people requesting Civ III Gold support - I am not surprised he hasn't been able to update the code.<br />

But I really hope SpidarZord has time to update PowerBar soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nexushyper</div><div class="date">Jan 18, 2004, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To all concerned about PowerBar!!!<br />
<br />
First, I will start by saying SpiderZord (with Crusader Joe's permission) will be sending me the PowerBar code and I will be taking over updating this great utility program.<br />
<br />
<br />
With that said, let me lay a few things down.<br />
<br />
I am 23 years old, work for the U.S. Air Force, and I'm married (no kids!!!).  Thus, I will fix bugs, make updates and changes when I can!  I have a feeling I have more time than SpiderZord has, however, please keep in mind that my wife and job do come first!  By taking over this project I have promised NOT to sell the code nor make a profit off it as well as ensure, to the best of my ability, that Powerbar is NOT used for multiplayer, which it currently is set-up to stop!!!!  I have also promised to do my best to provide an updated version of PowerBar to help the Civ III gaming community with a great Mod development and testing utility!  <br />
<br />
<br />
I will start a new thread in the coming days. I WILL NOT have a working powerbar out for atleast one month!! You read that right, one month!  Whereas Visual Basic 6.0 is not new to me, memory offset programing is!! Please bear with me as I learn the source code, read e-mails from SpiderZord and figure out where he left off.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the current posted version does not work for:<br />
Civ III Gold<br />
Civ III C3C<br />
<br />
It SHOULD work for:<br />
Civ III Vanilla (All patches)<br />
Civ III PTW (All patches)<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have those two versions and it doesn't work, you most likely need a VB runtime dll. When i start teh new thread, in a few days, I will include a link to get missing dlls and common runtime dlls for VB programs.  <br />
<br />
Again, please be patient and I will get you a working program. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I just realized one additional thing.  I do not have a copy of Civ III Gold and thus do not know if I will be able to get a working version of PowerBar for this.<br />
<br />
I hope to get PowerBar to work for:<br />
Civ III 1.29f<br />
Civ III PTW 1.27f<br />
Civ III C3C 1.??f (Depending on which patch is out once I understand PB)<br />
<br />
Possible:<br />
Civ III Gold (If I get a copy)<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, thanks CrusaderJoe and Thanks SpiderZord!!<br />

PowerBar has been an awesome experience.  It will do the project well to get a fresh perspective again, besides just having someone with the time to dedicate to the project. <br />
<br />
Thanks to the all the PowerBar fans for your continued support and willingness to help other users when I was out of touch.<br />

Hang tight while I get Nexushyper up to speed and give him time to get the updates done!!!<br />

Just thougt you guys would want to know that someone has taken your design and is now giving it out. I will try to post it for the next reply but if i cant find it then i will have to get it later, but it probably wont even matter once the code is updated.

Seriously - thank you, and thanks to Spider Zord for all the great work he put into Powerbar.  I've been using Powerbar for about a year and a half, and I've gotten 'hooked' on it!  Now, with Conquests, I'm forced to do things like scroll through the cities screen and COUNT the number of cities I have :cry: .</div></div><hr />

The main issue with winhack has been being able to figure out the memory offsets.  If you could provide help in this area it would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The best advice I can offer is that if your contact has little experiance with game hacking, start with the easy stuff, like gold and science, its easy to find what the values are in game, and pretty simple to do a search for, once you have something working, you know your on the right track :) <br />
<br />
For the more complex things (like playing arround with cities and units) I am not sure what you should look for, but I would guess there would be hints in the PB code, failing that, I'm sure there is something somewhere that shows how things are laid out in Civ3's memory space...</div></div><hr />

They might help you if you are nice. lol.</div></div><hr />

3.6 beta should work fine with regard to the units.  I have 3.6 and haven't had any troubles.  Was there a specific issue that you were referring to?</div></div><hr />

Was there a specific issue that you were referring to?  <br />
<br />
yes.  the unit trainer does not seem to recognize any units.  this can be seen by trying to apply the owner filter, to which the message &quot;unable to apply filter&quot; pops up.  when all filters are removed, it appears that all the units are seen as &quot;00000, Barbarian, Settler&quot;.  further, on attempting to view the 'Unit Info' tab, i recieve a run-time error 9.  i have seen these problems referred to in this thread, and the only conclusive note about this (posted on the first message) was that 3.5 beta does not have these problems.</div></div><hr />

Progress is being made in figuring out the memory offsets.  Optimistically, with playtesting, PowerBar should be ready for C3C by the end of the month. [party]</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nexushyper</div><div class="date">May 07, 2004, 12:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am still working on this and am the programmer NateDawgNY is talking about.  <br />
<br />
First, I apoligize.  I am in the military and SERVERAL unforseen events happened in my life!!  I contacted NateDawgNY around the mid of April I believe.  I am currently taking a Military Class that will be over 13 May!!  I have been working on PowerBar for C3C and will continue to and also, at this point, have a lighter work load and can... CAN sit at home and work on this.   I aplogize for teh delay and lack of response on my part.  Life is life and it comes first!!  Wife, life, God, my education and Military come before PowerBar so you all know!!<br />
<br />
Second, I have managned to find most of the used memory offsets in order to update PowerBar.  However, there is a LOT more to it than this.  I went to test the offsets and found several places is the code that require additional offsets to the main offsets.  I have e-mailed SpiderZord for help.  I plan on getting a version out that works for Nill Civ III 1.29, PTW 1.27F and C3C 1.22 with that said, if I have more troubles it could delay it more.  If I get help from SpiderZord it should go fast!  I can not, due to the problems I am having with teh code, promise end of May for a release.  I am hopefully that I can get you one by then... cross your fingers and I am and will continue to work this out!!!<br />
<br />
Third, I was in the Hospital for one day with Kidney Stones!!  It hurt, and that's all I say cuz it brings tears to my eyes just thinking of the pain!<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teknalee</div><div class="date">May 10, 2004, 06:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is really good and just for the record kidney stones really hurt....REALLY</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nexushyper</div><div class="date">May 10, 2004, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok everyone a quick update (AGAIN).  I spent the weekend working on powerbar.  It seems to work 75%.  What I mean by this is you can start it up for C3C, load the game, change gold info, complete techs, complete city production, use teh INFO button and get tile info, number units, techs known to each civ etc.  However, a few things don't work and because I've been stuck on fixing those I don't know what else doesn't work.  <br />
<br />
What doesn't work is build roads/rail, clear pollution/jungle, change game year.  I'm sure there is more, but I've been stuck on these so I haven't tested everything.  I have tested 75% so that is where the number comes from.  With that said, if someone could send me a saved game from C3C with all (or most) the land tiles covered in road/rail I would appreciate it.  I'd do it in the editor but I don't have time right now.<br />
<br />
Also, the version I release will be working for Civ Nilla 1.29, PTW 1.27f and C3C 1.22.  If Gold edition doesn't work I'm sorry I don't have a copy of it to test!!<br />
<br />
Again, please be patient and take care.  I have a busy week ahead at work so I will work on it again this coming weekend and having it tested (I hope) by the end of this month at the LATEST.... I hiope!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nexushyper</div><div class="date">May 10, 2004, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok another update!  Clear Jungle and Clear Pollution work!!   Still having problems with the roads/rail though :(<br />
<br />
Also, I found hidden in teh PB code another 30 offsets I need!!  Not sure what they are for as everything excpet roads/rail/change game year seem to work.  I'll keep you posted but if these turn out to be vital expect a delay!!<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: as for teh roads/rails it looks like C3C uses different values for roads and also each tile is now 16 bytes longer!!   May take some time to reverse engineer this one.   Good news though, those offsets don't seem to play a big role YET!   I may even post a Beta version tomoroow (minus a few things working I.E. roads) to tie people over till I get it all working!</div></div><hr />
