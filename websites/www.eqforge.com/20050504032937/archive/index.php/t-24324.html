I am not sure if Zouave (or Coracle) ever frequents the GOTM section of things, but I could not resist posting this example of his &quot;Settler Diarrhea&quot; phenomenon.<br />
<br />
This screen shot is from the view of Beijing when I encountered the Chinese and set up an embassy with them around 350AD (oops, this said 400BC when I first posted the thread and that was just a braincramp/typo that should have been about 400AD instead of BC) in GOTM-8.<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads/Beijing_in_350AD_cutoff.jpg<br />
<br />
The status of the continent that China is on is almost totally settled solid. There are a few culture gaps that I will try and exploit, but for the most part there are no places for any settlers to be used.<br />
<br />
Look at the Garrison for Beijing and you will see three settlers just sitting in the capital waiting for something to do. You will see no offensive military units even though China is the strongest civ on the continent.<br />
<br />
After I completed the game play I have been analyzing the saved games and log files to help me better understand how the AI plays the game and it has been very revealing. China had a total of 9 settlers built and sitting in cities with no place to go and these settlers were just tying up resource production potential that could have been more points and more growth per turn. India and Japan were in similar but slightly smaller states of &quot;Settler Constipation&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is a Monarch level game, so I believe the AI gets some extra military units for free to start the game. The game is also Raging Barbarian activity level.<br />
<br />
When the AI founds its first city in this game for each civ, every one of the AI players immediately locks in on producing a settler. What is amazing about this observation is that it is impossible for a player to produce a settler as the first unit from 9 out of 10 start positions. The first city has to grow to a population of 3 citizens in order to produce a settler and on monarch level this growth would require the AI players to produce at least 36 extra food units and 27 shields. The human player would need 40 extra food units and 30 shields.<br />
<br />
The conflict comes in the Food vs Shields balance that makes it almost impossible to produce a settler without growing the population first. Most Human strategies, focus on building a unit like a warrior or a spearman, before attempting the first settler.<br />
<br />
In the AI cases, they are programmed to fixate on building settlers first, even when it is impossible for them to complete the task.<br />
<br />
In this case, the city food and shield production rates per turn were initially at:<br />
<br />
Beijing - 2 shields 3 food (bonus grassland with a cow)<br />
Berlin - 2 shields 2 food (bonus grassland and forest)<br />
Delhi - 1 shield 2 food (floodplain)<br />
Kyoto - 3 shields 2 food (grassland with a deer forest)<br />
London - 2 shields 3 food (bonus grassland with a cow)<br />
Moscow - 1 shield 2 food (floodplain)<br />
Paris - 2 shields 2 food (bonus grassland)<br />
<br />
All of the start positions were located on rivers with extra food and luxuries close at hand. Because most of the civs would use their workers to build roads and improve terrain, the adjacent squares could improve their contribution beyond the initial values but basically we can look at these starting positions and see that India and Russia need to make it a high priority to increase their shield production rates because they will have enough food to build a settler in 18 or fewer turns, but will only have shields to complete the settler in 27 turns (which is toooooooooo slow). {note that there is the possibility that India and Russia could pop rush a settler to help use up the excess population growth in their capitals due to all the flood plain food and this would help to compensate for the lack of shield producing squares early on.}<br />
<br />
Japan has a different problem in that Kyoto is located on grassland and cannot irrigate to increase food production under despotism. This limits growth (until they expand to the cow in turn 8/9) to only 2 food units per turn and makes the earliest expected turn for a settler set at 18 turns. With their high shield production the settler will be &quot;production complete&quot; at turn 9 and then just sit there wasting shields for 9 turns.<br />
<br />
What idiot programmed this AI decision tree??? Soren, did you do this?<br />
<br />
England and China are in the best positions for this Settler Fixated programming strategy to be effective, because if all else remains constant (in reality shields will actually go up) then the first settlers for these civs could be completed in under 14 turns when the shields are available and anytime after about 12 turns when the food has supported enough population growth.<br />
<br />
Paris(AI) and Berlin(human) would both need about 9 or 10 turns to grow the first step and then 6 or 7 turns to grow the next pop point because they gain a wheat and a cow respectively. Their shield production would be available almost at the same time frame.<br />
<br />
What is fairly clear from this peek into the AI mind sets, is that producing a settler as the first unit of the build plan is absolutely the wrong decision for over half of these civs.<br />
<br />
I should note that the Japanese position may have benefitted from the &quot;join the worker into the city and build settler&quot; gambit.<br />
<br />
By fixating on the initial settler build, many of these civs were crippled for the entire rest of the game. Japan wasted over half of their production potential in the early game and ended up in third place on their continent. India was not much ahead of Japan.<br />
<br />
On the continent with Germany, England, France and Russia, the Settler fixated initial decision directly caused RUssia to be killed-off in the first 30 turns because the Cathy AI, did not focus on improving production to keep pace with her neighbors. Taking 27 turns to complete your first unit is almost always fatal on Monarch level and above.</div></div><hr />

After I completed the game play I have been analyzing the saved games and log files to help me better understand how the AI plays the game and it has been very revealing. <br />
<br />
A question:  In a couple of your posts you have referred to the &quot;log files&quot;.  What are these?  Am I missing something?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 07, 2002, 02:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have two fairly big HDs so I just give a descriptive filename to the most of the turns and save them off to a timeline folder that I can then use to examine what the AI players are doing under various circumstances in the game.<br />
<br />
GOTM games are some of the few games I actually play to completion, so after they are done I spend some time analyzing what actual goes on in the games.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the game gets really frantic for a few turns when you are in a major war or when the AIs are fighting right in front of you, and I still forget to label the save files sometimes. I am just now getting fairly disciplined at this management technique.<br />
<br />
I wrote a script that just copied off the autosave files into a game timeline directory so that they would be logged and preserved, but that did not give them descripteive filenames that really help to do a proper postmortem on the games.<br />
<br />
(added info)<br />
<br />
I enjoy the CIV3 games, but very strongly feel there are some really bad mistakes in the coding that lead to a sort of &quot;skinner box&quot; approach that can be really disheartening to some players.<br />
<br />
My approach is to attack the beast as if I am going to manipulate the hell out of it every time I play, so that I can see how high it will jump or see how fast it will run. It gives me a thrill to do this while, just beating the crap out the game with more nukes or more armor holds no real thrill (yet !!). Been there done that.<br />
<br />
When I play, I have the game running plus in the background I have the following programs running:<br />
1) Mapstat: to track my civs progress in the world (I start using this about the time I begin discovering the rest of the world beyond my continent.<br />
2) A text editor (I use Word) to take notes as I go.<br />
3) A spread sheet program (I use Excel) to record some data on features I may be tracking. My hot button currently is mid game shield waste if I get that far.<br />
4) A screen capture utility so I can hotkey a shot of anything I want to save and see later.<br />
5) The file directory of my timeline save files so I can use the filenames as a quick log of events.<br />
<br />
I usually play focused test games but now am playing at a modified diety level where the unit costs are split into three levels by adding equalizer copies of the standard units that are only available to some civs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SirPleb</div><div class="date">Jun 07, 2002, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Very interesting cracker! This explains a lot of things. I've wondered why some AI Civs get off to such poor starts. In this GOTM, I ought to have been using Russia as my research ally since Russia is scientific. But France and England were stronger so I used them. It didn't really make sense - Russia's territory didn't seem that bad, she ought to have been a strong Civ. Now it becomes clear - it isn't the region they start in, it is the very specific first city setup which matters most. If the first city doesn't have resource tiles appropriate to the AI's fixed strategy, it won't compensate, and it gets off to a terrible start. AHA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">punkbass2000</div><div class="date">Jun 07, 2002, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought Russia clearly had the worst start of the three, with France having the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2002, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for the explanation - I was thinking that the game must write a log file that I was unaware of, or that there was a utility to extract one from the .sav file or something.<br />
<br />
And good analysis of the starting positions. :goodjob:<br />
<br />
 I found Cathy almost straight away (built a warrior, and sent it south), noticed she was very small, and too close for comfort.  So I built barracks and a couple of archers - more than enough, as even after doing all this she still only had two cities - one defended by a warrior IIRC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cracker</div><div class="date">Jun 08, 2002, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For Punkbass,<br />
<br />
I think it is wrong to say that Cathy had the worst starting position because with a better choice of strategy, more could have been done with the position.<br />
<br />
Remember that Cathy is sitting on land that is between plains and flood plain (with a few hills). So the initial choices with the despot penalties figured in are:<br />
Floodplains - 2 food 0 shields 1 gold for the river<br />
Plains - 1 food 1 shield<br />
Hills - 1 food 1 shield 1 gold for the river<br />
<br />
So what should Cathy do with her worker and what should she build???<br />
<br />
Cathy has six Floodplain tiles including 2 with wheat that will be within her radius and she has 8 plains tiles that will be within her radius including 1 elephant.<br />
<br />
This is a great start position if you use a strategy appropriate for the terrain. If you fixate on builiding a settler as the first unit then you will be stunted.<br />
<br />
Remember that in 8 turns, the culture will pop out the boundaries to include access to the wheats and the ivory but the ivory must have roads to it in order to be effective. It will take 12 worker turns to reach the ivory.<br />
<br />
The one thing Cathy needs most at this point is shield production and she can get that in two ways during the despot phase of the game: Option 1 is mine the plains at a cost of 6 worker turns per mine. Option 2 is to irrigate the floodplain and gain 1 more food unit per turn at a cost of 4 worker turns per irrigation knowing that despot will allow you to &quot;rush&quot; things by sacrificing 1 person for 20 shields of production when that person only cost you 18 food units to grow.<br />
<br />
The presence of the river in the midst of Cathy's territory also impacts the decision to build roads or not because tiles next to rivers get a one gold bonus that is countered with a movement penalty that keeps roads from working when you must cross a river (you canot get river crossings until Engineering.)<br />
<br />
My strategy would probably be to irrigate the flood plain without a road and move to the south wheat and irrigate it as well. Then road back to Moscow and work out towards the Elephant placing mines then roads. The best square to irrigate first is probably the floodplain square in the south position because it is already across the river so that any road connections out from that point will be unbroken. As the human player I would not know that the buttload of cows was in that direction as well but Cathy will know that with her AI zoom power as well as her scout-warrior-spearman-spearman bonus.<br />
<br />
This would give me a food and shield generation yield of<br />
1---------5---------------10------------------15------------------20  &lt;--turn number<br />
i--i--i--i--I--I--I--I---R--R--R--R---R---R--r---r---r---r---r---r   &lt;-- worker activity<br />
2-2-2-2-3-3-2*-2**-5--5--4*-4**-5--5--4*-4**-5--5--4*-4**  &lt;-- food stored<br />
1-1-1-1-1-1-2*-2**-1--1--2*-2**-1--1--2*-2**-1--1--2*-2**  &lt;-- shields produced<br />
1-2-3-4-5-6-8-10---11-12-14-16--17-18-20-22---23-24-26-28     &lt;-- shields stored<br />
1-1-1-1-1-1-2--2----2--2---2--3---3--3--3--4----4---4--4--3   &lt;--- population<br />
<br />
<br />
Note that the * (asterisks) indicate where we need to micromanage the production citizens to balance food and shields. The AI could easily do this as well because it is just simple math and computers excel at simple math choices.<br />
<br />
The ** (double astersisks) are points in time were a new citizen is produced.<br />
<br />
The result of this path produces the first settler at turn 20 instead of turn 27 as with the wya the AI Cathy performed in the game.<br />
<br />
We are also in a position to produce the next settler for our third city by micromanaging food and shields out to turn 26 and then pop rushing the loss of one citizen into turn 27.<br />
<br />
So by using the micromanaged floodplains and a little pop rushing we could produce 2 settlers in the same time it took the AI Cathy to produce 1 settler. This would radically change the outcome of the game.</div></div><hr />
