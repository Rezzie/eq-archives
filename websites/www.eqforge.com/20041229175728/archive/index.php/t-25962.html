You want to access your Recycled directory.  or you want a demonstration of how to use the Dir and Attrib commands.<br />
<br />
<br />
Description<br />
A CFC member had to access the Recycled directory to delete a newly released virus (June 2002).  Normally, you cannot see the recycled directory.  And normally, you cannot see its files or delete them.<br />
<br />
This will use the DOS commands Dir (Directory) and Attrib (Show/Change  file attributes).<br />
<br />
<br />
Procedure:<br />
<br />
1.  Boot into DOS mode (do not boot to Windoze) <br />
<br />
2. Use a non-inflected floppy to boot, if at all possible (BORROW one, if you have to) !!!<br />
<br />
3.  Change to the c: drive, type:<br />
c:<br />
<br />
4.  To see the recyled directory , type:<br />
dir /ah /p /v<br />
<br />
5. Change to the recycled directory:<br />
cd recycled<br />
<br />
6.  See what is in the directory:<br />
dir /ah /p /v<br />
<br />
7.  Decide what you wanna kill.<br />
<br />

<br />
8.  To delete, you need the attrib command (use &quot;attrib /?&quot; for help); start with:<br />
attrib<br />
<br />
9. To the left of the filename will be one or more of the following letters RASHD.  Lets get the ones that matter -  type:<br />
<br />
attrib -r -s -h FILENAME.TXT<br />
<br />
(Obviously, you change FILENAME.TXT to the file you are after!)<br />
<br />
<br />
10.  Now do a plain dir command:<br />
dir<br />
<br />
11.  You should now see the file you wanna delete - type:<br />
del FILENAME.TXT<br />
<br />
12.  File should be gone.<br />
<br />
13.  Repeat for any other files you want gone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Caveats<br />
<br />
1. Always keep your critical data backed up.<br />
<br />
2. Be sure of your keystrokes, particularly before deleting.<br />
