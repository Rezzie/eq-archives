Everything works fine, but I have given it a movement rate of 1 (they sort of drift around and don't get too far from port).  However, when I play the game, they have a movement rate of 3?  Any hints?<br />
<br />
I was thinking maybe there is something in the Civ program that says all seas units must be able to move 3.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you should try the in-game editor. If you don't have that, I don't know what you can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ahenobarb</div><div class="date">May 26, 2001, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks, Kira.  Actually, I figured it out.  I have the lighthouse and Magellan's expedition.  Everyone beside me can only move 1.<br />
<br />
Speaking of movement 0 though, I have a unit that is only used to defend cities (like a pillbox).  It works great except that, since it cannot move, you are not informed  that it is finished.  If you are not careful, you end up with 3 in a city, without even knowing it.</div></div><hr />

I think that the game informs of any non-combat (attack=0) units. A 0-movement unit should not need attacking power either.</div></div><hr />
