            <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Submitted by: Kivorn<br><br></font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Welp, tomorrow is patch day. And what a patch day it is! Hybrids get totally tossed around in the tumbler on this one. Here's what Absor had to say about tomorrow:<br><br><i>We’ve got a lot of changes planned for the next patch. Changes for hybrids, a change to the way that movement spells work (specifically Root), and a bug fix for Lure spells (among many other things). First and foremost I want to explain the fix to Lures.<br>Right now (before the patch), creatures that should not get a save versus Lure spells are getting saves based on their levels. This has been broken for a while. We fixed it on test before Christmas, but this is the first patch since then, and the fix should go live with the patch. Basically, Lures will become less resisted after the patch.<br><br>The changes to hybrid disciplines and powers are as follows. Hopefully these will be the last. <br><br>1) Resistant Discipline will last five minutes instead of one minute.<br>2) Holyforge Discipline will lasts five minutes instead of two minutes.<br>3) Sanctification Discipline will last fifteen seconds instead of ten seconds<br>4) Lay on Hands will have increased healing for each level after forty of the paladin. After forty it will do approximately twenty points per level more (for levels 41-60).<br>5) Normal Harm Touches will save as all or nothing. There will be no partial resists.<br>6) Harm Touch will increase ten points per level for levels one through forty. From levels forty-one to sixty it will increase thirty points per level instead of twenty<br>7) The Harm Touch discipline will increase Harm Touch damage by fifty percent instead of twenty-five percent<br>8) Weaponshield discipline will last twenty seconds instead of fifteen<br>9) Leechcurse discipline will last twenty seconds instead of fifteen<br>10) Deftdance will have its duration increased from ten to fifteen seconds<br>11) Puretone will have duration increased from two to four minutes<br>12) Hybrids will no longer reset weapon timers after casting a spell (further explanation below)<br>13) Trueshot discipline damage calculations will be changed (further explanation below)<br><br><br>We will also be giving Hybrids a new spell at level fifty.<br><br>Now for the further explanation:<br><br>Trueshot damage was messed up. Basically it was giving low damage bows too much damage and high damage bows too little damage. We are making the damage more in line with the base damage of the bow. This will reduce the damage of the discipline for some and increase it for others, depending on the type of bow you were using.<br><br>As for the timer/casting thing… As it is now, casting a spell while using a weapon will cause your weapon swings to be delayed by the casting time of the spell. So, making up numbers here, lets assume you would swing your weapon every ten seconds. If you were to cast a five second casting time spell directly after a weapon swing, then your next swing would occur fifteen seconds after the last one (adding the five seconds for the spell). For hybrids, this will no longer happen. So if your weapon takes ten seconds to swing, spell casting will no longer increase that swing time.<br><br><br>Movement Rate Changes:<br><br>We have made some changes to the way movement enhancement/reduction works. Essentially, Root and Snare are now completely different spells. This means that Root will suppress snare, but it will not overwrite it. That's the primary change. But there is also a side effect to this change.<br><br>Bard songs will no longer break root. Root will also suppress songs that enhance movement.<br><br>We are aware that this will be seen as a 'nerf'. However, I'm pretty sure that most of you understood that bard songs were never intended to break root, and this is, in fact, essentially a bug fix.<br><br>Alan<br></i></font></p><p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="FFFFFF"><a href="mailto:sunmoon@eqforge.com"><b>sunmoon@eqforge.com</b></a></font></p>
