For example, if I turn off all types of victory besides Culture, will it actually attempt to overwhelm me with culture, or will it simply play as before?  Will it even bother building the space ship if space victory is disabled?  I'm curious if it knows what to not bother wasting it's time on. <br />

So, does anyone know whether the AI understands the objectives of a particular game or not?</div></div><hr />

Also, the AI will directly try to stop other civs from winning.  In one game, the French built the UN.  The English, who were at war with everyone, and obviously feared a diplomatic victory if an election was held, immediately declared war, seized Paris and held it.  Needless to say, an election never took place.  I was impressed.</div></div><hr />
