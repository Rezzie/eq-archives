<br />
On the PC that connects to the internet, I have just installed XP service pack two (it sXP 'home' - the other PC is 'professional').  Now that I have done this, I can connect to the internet, and load up one or two pages without problems.  Then it loses the connection, and I get 'page not found' errors for all pages.  This problem happens again and again.  The only way I can restore it is to disconnect from the internet, and reconnect again.<br />
<br />
The really strange thing is that it is the browser - because I can still use the connection with no problems from the other PC (Which I am doing right now).  I have tried disabling the XP firewall, disabling the pop-up blocker and reducing the security settings - all to no avail.  Any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

See bottom of page for a solution to re-installing IE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kcwong</div><div class="date">Oct 19, 2004, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is the XP Professional SP2 also?<br />
<br />
Things to try:<br />
<br />
1) Try unplugging the other PC (the professional one) from the network. See if disconnect still happens.<br />
<br />
2) When you got disconnect in IE, open command prompt (Start | Run, type &quot;CMD&quot;, press ENTER). Type &quot;ping www.yahoo.com&quot; and see if it can reach the site or not.<br />
<br />
Post the results then... it might tell about the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MOTH</div><div class="date">Oct 19, 2004, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After installing XP SP2 Professional on 2 PCs I am now having ongoing problems with IP adress conflicts that come up out of nowhere.  I have released the IP leases, tried to assign static IPs.  I have a 3rd PC that is W98 with no problems.<br />
<br />
Strange thing is: The 2 XP SP2 PC's can both connect to the W98 box over the wireless net but can't get to the internet.  The 98 box can do everything (of course I have no monitor or keyboard hooked up so that cramps things).<br />
<br />
My Fix: every 24-48 hours I hit reset on my wireless router and by the time I am back upstairs everything is fine.<br />
<br />
Well, not fine, but better.  The internet seems painfully slow lately.  Is it all the XP SP2 updates eating up bandwidth?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it doesn't work also try &quot;ping 66.94.234.13&quot; which is the IP for yahoo when I try it.  This would tell you if it is a name resolution thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ainwood</div><div class="date">Oct 19, 2004, 01:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am starting to think its caused by a virus.  I noticed that my PC hangs a bit following these crashes, and that the internet connection from that PC is very slow (I also noticed that there appears to be a lot more data being sent to / from my PC than would normally be expected with the browsing I do!)<br />
<br />
Anyway, when it was hanging for a few seconds, the process list informed me that I had two copies of a process called 'winitr32.exe' running, each taking up 50% of the CPU time!  This is being loaded via the startup, so I disabled it via msconfig.  And, it was reenabled automatically when I next booted. :hmm:  <br />
<br />
<br />
After sending the file to the link below this is what we found.<br />
 &lt;http://www.kaspersky.com/scanforvirus&gt;<br />
http://www.kaspersky.com/scanforvirus <br />
 <br />
I'm awaiting the binary to review.<br />
 <br />
It probably came in on a laptop and spread to machines unpatched to MS04-11.<br />
W32/Forbot-C is a worm which attempts to spread to remote network shares.<br />
The worm also contains backdoor Trojan functionality, allowing unauthorised<br />
remote access to the infected computer via IRC channels while running in the<br />
background as a service process. <br />
<br />
W32/Forbot-C moves itself to the Windows system folder as winitr32.exe<br />
andcreates the following registry entries to run itself on system logon: <br />
<br />
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\<br />
Win32 Wmls Driver = winitr32.exe<br />
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\<br />
Win32 Wmls Driver = winitr32.exe<br />
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunServices\<br />
Win32 Wmls Driver = winitr32.exe<br />
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\<br />
Win32 Wmls Driver = winitr32.exe<br />
HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce\<br />
Win32 Wmls Driver = winitr32.exe <br />
<br />
W32/Forbot-C attempts to spread to network machines using various exploits<br />
including the LSASS vulnerability (please see MS04-011<br />
&lt;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS04-011.mspx&gt; ). <br />
<br />
W32/Forbot-C attempts to terminate several processes related to anti-virus<br />
and security related software. <br />

<br />
Now, the strange thing is that I don't know where this virus could have come from!  I reformatted my HDD on sunday, and since then have only installed programs from CDROMs - all genuine, and nothing new.</div></div><hr />

The internet seems painfully slow lately.  Is it all the XP SP2 updates eating up bandwidth?Well, it was actually because of painfully-slow internet that I installed SP2 when I did - I was about to start playing with modem settings and install SP2 &quot;later&quot;.  I didn't want to tweak my modem settings and then somehow lose them when XP2 changed all the security.<br />
<br />
Yes, the internet was painfully slow, but I can't blame SP2 for it, although now its worse....<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  PS thanks for the ping suggestion - I'll try it, but am at work now...</div></div><hr />

I'll have to check my other PC, and see if its installed itself there.  I &lt;hope&gt; that's the only problem - shutting down that 'service' did nothing to stop these problems with IE disconnecting. :(</div></div><hr />
