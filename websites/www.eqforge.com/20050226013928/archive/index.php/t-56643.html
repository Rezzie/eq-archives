BBF is defended by a legion. Sleeping dips have 2 moves left.<br />
<br />
Things to consider:<br />
Tax rates.<br />
<br />
Looking at the current situation, which wonder shall we start with. Shall we deliver all commod caravans or use some of them for wonders.<br />
<br />
We can trade nav with chinese, and probably should before next turn.<br />
<br />
What about growth and improvements in smaller cities?<br />
<br />
Shall we try to grow larger cities (although just a few pops) if we can, even if it means severly reduced production for several turns? E.g. LC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 23, 2003, 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We should bribe one of the elephants near BBF and use it to kill the barb stack.<br />
<br />
We definitely should try acquiring navigation from the Chinese. A new question that this raises is whether we should try building Magellan in addition to the other three wonders (which would take priority of course).<br />
<br />
I think we should try to finish the three wonders we want ASAP by combining caravans and cash by setting taxes to 70% for maybe 2-5 turns. Building wonders while celebrating isn't a very good idea IMHO.<br />
<br />
We should deliver caravans from cities with less than three trade routes to Dou but use other caravans for wonder building even if they are not food. An exception might be something like LC's dye caravan, dye is widely demanded but few cities supply it - we might even want to deliver this one abroad.<br />
<br />
Regarding the smaller cities: Rush buy, rush buy, rush buy ! We are almost finished perfecting the bigger cities but I don't think we should start celebrating until we have a little more stuff in the smaller cities (FJ, BP and BBF). Also we need Bach before celebrating unless we want out triremes to stay in town (a bad idea IMO).<br />
<br />
I'll post a poll tomorrow, it will probably be a short one (continue with the build queues yes/no, tax rate and how to build the wonders).<br />
<br />
I seems to me we should be ready to start celebrating roughly 5 turns from now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2003, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't looked at this turn much but I agree with much of what Viking says.<br />
<br />
Bribe and kill the barb elephants.  It would be nice to capture the leader, but with just a legion in BBF, it's not worth the risk.<br />
<br />
Getting Navigation = A Good Thing<br />
<br />
I would not build any wonders until we are close to having enough vans in reserve to build the next one as well.  Both economics and Invention are out there, so we want to be able to respond if someone is close to finishing either.  Waiting until we have enough sheilds for both is the safest approach.<br />
<br />
Caravans for trade routes go to Dou.  If there's a good demand delivery, go ahead with it.  Everything else goes to Neu for Wonders.  I'd IPRB these to speed the wonders.  I'd be interested in seeing a list of what we have left to buy where before celebrating (including the vans for at least 3 wonders)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2003, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BBF is defended by a legion, and the only land square outside it is jungle, so any elephants trying to attack us would be killed before. The question should be if we shall try to bribe the lone one despite it not being a none.<br />
<br />
It really begins taking a lot of time to play the turns, I spent 4h 30min this sunday and only played a few turns.:eek:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2003, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You're doing great.  Take all the time you need. If we have to cut back to less than 2  rounds a week then so be it.<br />
<br />
A quick thought about trading for Navigation.  Since we have Gunpowder, the Chinese will undoubtedly demand it in exchange for Navigation.  Is that something we are willing to give up at this time? or should we just plug away at it by ourselves?<br />
<br />
Perhaps our Foreign or Defense ministers have thoughts on this matter?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2003, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Planning what the MoDA wants to do is sometimes also starting to take a lot of time, especially when taking into account the time it takes to then create and post the polls.<br />
<br />
Planning the build queues etc. last time plus posting polls etc. probably took at least 3 hours (!), probably more.<br />
<br />
Playing less than 2 times a week (either only once a week or e.g. every 5 days) is an idea and maybe playing 6-10 turns in most cases instead of the frequently 4-6 turns.<br />
<br />
This could be made easier by making the build queues more 'generic'/flexible.<br />
<br />
Regarding the Chinese, they might accept the 'alternative' tech instead of GP. It would be fun to wholly or partially conquer an AI civ before it gets gunpowder. We need more land for our empire - there's a lot of land near BBF though and once BBF reaches size 12 I'd like to IPRB 4-6 settlers there to found new cities and then grow BBF back to size 12, preferably by celebrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jun 24, 2003, 11:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, first of all we should see who is in position to aquire it from the chinese: Peace with the greeks. There is a risk that the greeks will get it, especially since the greeks are far more advanced than the chinese, and we don't want them to have it. They are not really close to discovering it themselves, but if they trade for invention they'll be able to pick it as their next research. It should be included in some poll.<br />
<br />
Second of all, since the indians will get it from GL we should probably give it to them ourselves first if we decide to do the trade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2003, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll play tomorrow instead of today, and hope that's all right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2003, 12:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's all right - actually I'd favor increasing the time between playing the turns a little because running the empire (domestic affairs in my case) is starting to take a lot of time.</div></div><hr />
