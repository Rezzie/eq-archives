We would have to deal with a Sea bore Invasion to Greece. The first thing we do is we must load up ourships and have the Galleys (Threames) head to there coast. Once there we can unload the Troops and take there cities.<br />
<br />
Since the Majority of the Greek lands is mostly unexplored. Its quite hard to do a map woth only the outlaying coast line.<br />
<br />
Here is the current options of the Poll.<br />
<br />
1. Attack the Northwestern side<br />
2. Attack the Western side<br />
3. Attack the Southwestern side<br />
4. Abstain</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tim also mentioned in the turn thread that they probably defend their cities with vet pikemen, meaning a mounted attack would be hard. Athens is also on a river...</div></div><hr />

Period. So let's teach the Greeks a lesson :rocket: :ripper: :rocket2:. That is, if I have things my way. The western side looks easiest, starting with Thessalonica. Blenheim Palace can be used as a base, it will be a nice size 8+ city once the action starts.</div></div><hr />

By the looks of the Polls. It looks like the People would like to attack on the Western Side of the Greeks. Don't know how you're getting that conclusion.  Just as many people people voted for no attack at all.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, that poll was from two sets of turns ago...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 06:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">However, the majority still seems to want to start 'peacekeeping' operations against the Greeks but not everyone agrees where.<br />
<br />
IMO a 'No war' option was missing but that said the Ministry of Domestic Affairs strongly advocates sending troops to liberate cities that rightfully belong to us :D, we should expand but we do not have a lot of land to do so.<br />
<br />
We are now finally getting ready to start building barracks and troops as the latest build queue poll shows.</div></div><hr />

You must have big plans considering we have all of Jayneland and Barbaria  to colonize...:) <br />
<br />
BTW, we haven't bribed a single unit from Berlin. They haven't let out any. How about building up a small force of two or three cavalries and just capture it before the chinese do? The defender I can see while looking at the city in viewing pieces is a fortified archer, so we shouldn't have any problem capturing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that Jayneland isn't big (we'll probably be finished colonizing it less than 15 turns from now) and getting decent cities up and running in Barbaria takes a lot of time because there's only one city there. A possible idea would be to 'jumpstart' some cities there by founding them and then adding two engineers to them and immediately start celebrating. This might reduce BBF to size 3 but it would quickly grow again.<br />
<br />
Also why waste time building something you can capture from someone else ? :satan: :devil2:<br />
<br />
Actually I was going to ask about barbs near Berlin. Yes, capturing Berlin is a good idea. Barracks in BBF plus 2-3 crusaders (or cavalry, depending on research path) should be sufficent.</div></div><hr />
