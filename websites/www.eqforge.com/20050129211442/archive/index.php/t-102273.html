<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MarineCorps</div><div class="date">Oct 14, 2004, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Google Inc. released a free tool today that lets people simultaneously search the Web and their personal computers for information, a move analysts described as a potential blow to rivals Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc. in the race to woo searchers and dominate the hottest area of online advertising. <br />
<br />
Google's new &quot;desktop search&quot; software offers what Microsoft has been trying to develop for more than a year -- the ability to let people enter one search term and see files relevant to that topic from both their computers and the Web displayed together. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;This gives Google a huge first-mover advantage in desktop search,&quot; said Charlene Li, principal search analyst for Forrester Research, a market research firm. She predicted the tool would be especially popular with heavy computer users, who store many files on their machines and need help sifting through them. <br />
<br />
&quot;It's ironic that until now, it's been easier to search six billion documents on the Internet than it has been to find a single file on your hard drive,&quot; Li said. <br />
<br />
Google's new software, available as a free download at http://desktop.google.com, not only indexes the full text of e-mail messages and word processing documents, but also gives people the option of creating a searchable archive of all Web pages they visit and all instant messages they send and receive with AOL software. <br />
<br />
&quot;The goal for the application was for it to behave like a photographic memory for your computer,&quot; said Marissa Mayer, Google's director of consumer Web products. &quot;So in addition to being able to search all of the files on your computer, it also indexes the Web pages you have seen.&quot; <br />
<br />
Mayer said Google's research shows that computer users want to find information swiftly, but they typically do not remember where they saw it, leading the company to develop a product that searches the Internet, e-mails, Instant Messages, and desktop files stored on a personal computer simultaneously. <br />
<br />
The new Google product is the company's first major innovation since its initial public offering in August, when it sold shares to investors for $85-a-share. Yesterday, Google stock closed at $140.90, up $3.50. <br />
<br />
Analysts who tested the software say it is simple and fast, partly because it operates the same way Google does on the World Wide Web, by creating an index of the files it finds in advance and then searching that index when someone enters a query. That makes it speedier than the approach used by the search tool built into Microsoft's Windows operating system, which does no indexing and must inspect the original files each time it gets a query. <br />
<br />
Google's new product is &quot;very, very good,&quot; said Danny Sullivan, editor of searchenginewatch.com, an online newsletter that tracks the search engine industry. Sullivan said he has been testing Google's search tool and found one of its most useful features to be the way that it stored a copy of all the pages he visited online and then made that personal Web surfing history available to him. <br />
<br />
&quot;One of the more compelling things to me is it improves your Web searching,&quot; said Sullivan. He said he previously had been skeptical of Microsoft's declared intention to offer people a unified searching ability, combining files found on the computer with documents from the Web. &quot;This leaves me feeling that integrated search really is useful,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
Google's release of the product ahead of Microsoft poses a problem for the Redmond, Wash., software giant, Sullivan said, because the personal archiving capability likely will grow more valuable to users over time, making it harder to switch to another search engine product: &quot;You may not want to give up that recorded history you have.&quot; <br />
 <br />
 <br />
While Microsoft has been promising to develop and release a new search product that would make it faster for users to find information on their personal computers, the company has pushed back its timetable. Yesterday, Microsoft officials said they would have a new desktop search tool within a year. <br />
<br />
&quot;Our focus is on helping consumers get faster, cleaner and easier access to the information they want, not on what other companies are doing,&quot; said Justin Osmer, product manager for Microsoft's MSN division. &quot;We plan to offer desktop search with updates to our existing service within the next year.&quot; <br />
<br />
Microsoft already offers the Lookout Personal Search Tool, which facilitates searches for millions of computer users who use Microsoft Outlook. But the company does not have a way for computer users to simultaneously search desktop files and information on the Internet. <br />
<br />
&quot;Customers want search capabilities that help them access information no matter where it resides, across the Internet, their P.C., the intranet and e-mail,&quot; Osmer said. &quot;This is a big challenge. . . . Microsoft and the rest of the industry have only scratched the surface on how search technology can help consumers.&quot; <br />
<br />
Google's desktop search only works on computers running Windows, specifically Windows XP and Windows 2000, and indexes the full text of only certain documents, including those created in Microsoft's Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail programs, Microsoft Word, Excel and Powerpoint. With other files, such as photographs and music, it simply indexes the names of files. <br />
<br />
People who install the desktop software can run Google searches a number of different ways -- looking for files stored only on their computers, for files stored only on the Internet or for a mixture of both. <br />
<br />
Google, which makes its money showing ads related to queries, said it plans to show no advertising when users search only for files on their local computers, at least not while the product is in its test or &quot;beta&quot; stage. However, Google will show ads on results pages when someone chooses to see results from both the Web and their computer together, according to Mayer. <br />
<br />
The company is proceeding cautiously with regard to privacy, given the uproar over the issue created earlier this year when it introduced a its G-mail product, which placed ads beside e-mails. <br />
<br />
Mayer said early testing of the product shows that most people will use it to search the Internet and their personal computers for information simultaneously, which will add to the number of Internet searches done through Google. &quot;As a result, we will serve more Web results pages and more ads, and those ads have more chances of getting clicked on. So there will be incremental Web search revenue from this product,&quot; Mayer said. <br />
<br />
Once the Google search technology is installed for free on a personal computer, it will transmit basic data daily about usage patterns. For example, it will tell the company how often Google is being used to search personal computers, how often it is used to search the Web, and how often simultaneous searches are done. Google lets users opt out of sending some usage data, but not all of it. <br />
<br />
However, Mayer said the data collected will be aggregated so that the company knows where to focus its efforts on upgrading the search technology. She emphasized that the daily up-loading will not transmit any personal information to Google and said it is typical for major software programs that offer voluntary upgrades and fixes for bugs to capture that sort of information as a matter of routine. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is the most personal information Google has ever dealt with,&quot; Mayer said of the new desktop search technology. &quot;We take user privacy and user trust very seriously. And we have throughout the entire development of this product.&quot; <br />
<br />
To enable users to maintain the confidentiality of files on their personal computers, or to permit them to keep their Web surfing destinations a secret, the new desktop search tool lets people block it from archiving visits to specific Internet sites, or from accessing private or confidential information stored on a P.C. In addition, there is a 15-minute snooze bar that allows a user to temporarily turn the archiving feature off if, for example, someone wants to do online shopping for a family member or friend and keep it a secret. <br />
<br />
Gary Price, a search specialist who runs a Web reference site called ResourceShelf.com, noted that the new archiving capability could raise privacy issues by making it easier for people to search and find material on other people's computers when they step away from their desks. That could be troubling in the workplace where people often leave their desks unattended, he said: &quot;In a couple of minutes, people can search your entire computer and find anything in any one of your documents.&quot;  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stormbind</div><div class="date">Oct 14, 2004, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Linux is overated. It's a very fast console (like MS-DOS) system, but when you load X Windows (the GUI engine) and then add an environment (i.e. KDE) it's a slow, bloated mess.<br />
<br />
This is all because X Windows display system (aka X11 Protocol) was never designed for powering performance desktop applications. Instead, it was designed for network portability (i.e. displaying a server desktop on remote client PC).<br />
<br />
One of the reasons X11 is slow, is because it has no native widgets (i.e. buttons, borders, etc.) and requires that such things be written for each application seperately.<br />
<br />
This is why there are so many competing desktop environments (i.e. KDE, GNOME, CDE, ROX etc.) as each desktop environment creates widgets that hosted applications can use. It's all the extra layers stacked up, so at the end of the day, a Linux &quot;desktop&quot; PC is a huge pile of poorly designed concepts making it worse than Windows 95!!<br />
<br />
Many realise that X11 needs to be abandoned, but that means abandoning all the desktop environments that run ontop of X11... and all the applications written for those environments... so it won't happen!<br />
<br />
Putting desktops to one side, Linux is slower than WindowsXP when running OpenGL games. This is partly because most device drivers for Linux are inferior: many hardware details are trade secrets so the open source community cannot write drivers comparible in efficiency to the vendor-written closed source drivers released for Windows.<br />
<br />
Add all of the above together, and you aren't missing much. I'm not fond of Windows, but Linux isn't a viable replacement. There are 50+ alternative operating systems (most of them free), and many are better than Linux for desktop computing.</div></div><hr />

Name them.<br />
<br />
I see BeOS, which is old and unsupported by anyone or anything (with no apps being ported there nowaday) and to a certain extent SkyOS (which has virtually no apps as well). But anyway, go ahead and name those 50+ OSes.<br />
<br />
And I'll point out a few errors in your post as well. First, X11 is a protocol, just like HTTP. Second, Network transparency has nothing to do with the speed problems you mention. Third, The speed problems you're talking about are probably from XFree86, the X server that was the most widespread not long ago. It's been replaced by Xorg now, and it's much faster. Besides, there are other xserver that are blazingly fast. Fourth, widget drawing doesn't change mcuh about the speed. Frankly, on a fairly modern computer (&gt;600Mhz), it doesn't make a difference. Take Mozilla as an exemple, it's all widget drawing, and it's not slower than IE. I don't know at which number I am now, but X11 is a perfectly well done protocol, and no one except a few lunatics want to change the protocol. They wanted to changed the bloated and old server. And finally, OpenGL games are as fast on Linux as on Windows provided the right drivers (example : http://www.anandtech.com/linux/showdoc.aspx?i=2241). nVidia does that, and the speed are about the same on both OS. Next time you want to write a post about Linux, verify your fact before spreading FUD like that.<br />
<br />

<br />
When will people learn? Linux is only a kernel, no more and no less that that. And it does its job fine as a kernel. Linux can run whatever you throw at it as long as its made for it. And nowaday, Linux is not only used for programming (If it would only be for programming, I'm pretty sure there wouldn't be 3 different Office suite, about 10 different browsers and as much IM clients). Linux is as much for Desktop use as for any other use (Ok, games aren't there yet, but it's not because it's impossible to run them, it's most of the time because they're written on DirectX and not portable, or simply because the developpers don't make a Linux version. For those in DirectX, port them to OpenGL and make a Linux binary, you probably won't see a difference with the original game. For the already OpenGLed games, just make Linux binaries, and you won't see the difference again.).</div></div><hr />

Porting DirectX to Linux is not possible in itself. Wine does it by reproducing the Windows API, but it's far from perfect. Other than, that, it's virtually impossible to port Direct X without having access to the source code. Not going to happen. Anyway, companies that want to develop for code portability use OpenGL instead of DirectX/3D.<br />
<br />
Actually http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?t=93759 Just remembered that. <br />
<br />
That's not porting the game. That's reproducing the windows API to run Windows binaries on Linux. But this is not the solution to Linux gaming. The solution is native games. To simplify things, Cedega (formerly WineX) and Wine could be compared to emulators (They're not, they're &quot;compatibility layers&quot;). Not a bad solution, but it has advantages and disadvantages.<br />
<br />
Advantages :<br />
<br />
Play Windows game now on Linux<br />
Use you Windows apps in general on Linux (which is the objective of Wine)<br />
<br />
Disadvantages :<br />
<br />
Developpers won't port their apps saying that they work anyway through Wine<br />
Things will continue to be developped for Windows only and this won't help Linux in general<br />
DirectX gets updated about once a year, and Windows API change at every windows release. This means 100% compatibility won't ever be reached unless Microsoft releases Windows source (yeah, right!)</div></div><hr />

Seems very odd that you correct me by almost quoting me :p<br />
<br />
aka X11 Protocol<br />
<br />
And... it's absolutely abysmal ;)<br />
<br />
Lack of widgets are a key problem. You want them hardware accelerated (at the lowest possible level) with the minimal number of messages between application and hardware. X11 forces the use of additional layers, to support widgets, which multiplies (many times) the number of messages passed from high-level applications to low-level system software specifically because it does not support it's own widgets.<br />
<br />
So you want a long list of alternative Operating Systems, huh? Calling my bluff are you? Well... I made a list when brainstorming, at about the time I happened to be designing a display system and there were more than fifty alternatives!<br />
<br />
However, you may be in luck... because I cannot find the file, and if you check back in this very forum you will see that one of my hard drives blew up! The details might be on there. Seriously :sad:<br />
<br />
But as you won't actually be interested in the full list anyway, one of the better Open Source projects is the fork of AtheOS called Syllable. There are many other good solutions such as two forks of BeOS, which are Zeta, and Haiku. Hurd is the practically complete system ready to replace Linux as the GNU representative, and there's even a 32 bit version of DOS, and an Open Source rendition of Microsoft Windows NT! (I forgot the name of that one) ... I could go on for hours and easilly pass 50.</div></div><hr />

NVidia drivers are closed source. Try the open source NVidia drivers are they stink! Most vendors do not release closed source Linux drivers for their hardware, so you relly on the open source code which doesn't take full advantage of the hardware, and even many of those that do, do not release matured drivers.

Cause obviously there are lots of games made for syllable, and open-source display-drivers. You're dissing Linux because of those, but it's alright for Syllable? Cause if you exclude games, I'd say GNOME and KDE are still ahead, but that might be a question of preference and feelings. But I must admit they made nice progress. BeOS, read previous post. Oh, and the Hurd, the &quot;it will be ready soon&quot; where soon means about 50 years (and it uses X btw). The open source Windows NT is called ReactOS, and if you call that a desktop OS, well...  It's mostly based on code from Wine, so that says it all if you ask me. And yes, I know there could be hours of other OS, but for desktop use? I maintain that on x86, the only working alternative for a desktop (and even a few games) is a Linux distro (unless you really know what you're doing).<br />

Browser content is extremely simple, and it's not easy to benchmark. However, I did make a re-write script that thrashed browser rendering by forcing re-rendering in quick succession.. <br />
<br />
Benchmark: MSIE ran it in &lt; 1s. FireFox took more than a minute!! :eek:<br />
<br />
Afaik, X.org is a fork of Xfree86 so I wouldn't expect any performance difference, at least not for a long while. Even if it is a little quicker, it won't cut down on the number of messages between Application and Destination.<br />
<br />
App -&gt; Kernel -&gt; Environment -&gt; Kernel -&gt; X11 -&gt; Kernel -&gt; X11 -&gt; Kernel -&gt; Display Driver<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if the above is accurate for Linux, because message systems vary.. but each message goes through memory, and if X11 and Environment were the same entity, then the number of messages would be greatly reduced.<br />
<br />
Cause obviously there are lots of games made for syllable, and open-source display-drivers. You're dissing Linux because of those, but it's alright for Syllable? <br />
It's actually X11 is that I hate, not Linux, and not Wine either ;)<br />
<br />
Syllable (for example) emphasises desktop acceleration and is a very young OS. I'm not saying it's better than Windows XP for home use. I'm saying it has a better design concept than Linux/X.<br />

Btw, Hurd is useable right now. Ok, no more threadjacking. My appologies, Google fans :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />

I agree that X11 requires more messages between the layers, but on modern systems, that is not a problem.  Indeed, by separating the layers more distinctly, many would say a *better* system is possible. Not faster, but better.  One reason is that you have a much broader choice of desktops.  KDE and Gnome are the two most widely used, but there are certainly others.  Not to mention, some Window Managers are not complete desktop environments the way KDE and Gnome are, so are much smaller and faster.  Check out this page (http://xwinman.org/) for a sample list of window managers available under X.<br />
<br />
As far as graphic card drivers, sure, the best ones are proprietary.  So what?  Only the extreme fanatics insist on everything in Linux being available in open source form.  NVidia and ATI, the two largest graphics card suppliers, provide excellent binary drivers that can be installed.  Then again, unless you really need cutting edge 3D graphics, the open source drivers that have been developed are also very good.  Certainly sufficient for any 2D/Office apps.  Most games, too.<br />

I generally have to agree with SodaPop, here.  He may be just a kid (;)), but he has that fire in his belly about computers that I used to have.  I've gotten old, and now want a system that just works.  So I run Mandrake 10.0 Official Edition (free).  I have fewer problems with it than I ever had with MS Windows.  The only thing I miss is a *few* of the games I used to play.  The important ones (like Civ3) I can still play via Cedega.<br />

Marine Corps: If you want to a *free* (there are still shipping charges - I'm not doing it out of the goodness of my heart ;)) copy of Mandrake 10.0, I can ship you the set of 3 install CDs.  PM me for details. :)</div></div><hr />

Linux has improved over the years, and is still improving at great rate.<br />
Xorg is great thing, I can tell you- with appropriate drivers it runs well if not better than windows GUI.<br />
<br />
However- linux is much more bloated. It is a fact- I'm running 60 processes on linux after installation, when on windows I have about 20.<br />
<br />
On speed- windows is much more optimized, standardized and in best case, linux will run up to windows speed. after all - it is running on same intel ix86 architecture.<br />
<br />
On mess- linux is indeed bad organized mess. take example of installed programs. how to uninstall them? in what directory they residue?<br />
windows had 3 main directories: documents and settings, windows, and program files. With little knowledge you know what are they for. But on linux you have 3-4 letter mess all over the partition, and some are repeating.</div></div><hr />

That shouldn't be hard to do with my computer since the OS seems to be falling apart. :p <br />

Keep in mind that in Windows, many processes hide behind the svchost process (that's why if svchost gets killed, the computer shuts down), so what's shown in Task Manager may not actually represent all of what's going on. Also, the number of processes that run by default in Linux depend on what distribution you're using. A more bloated distribution like Mandrake will have more processes running by default than a slimmer distribution like Slackware. Overall, the more user-friendly distributions of Linux are more bloated than Windows, but not by all that much.<br />
<br />
<br />

It's true that in many distributions of Linux, uninstalling programs can be a mess. Some of them do provide easier ways of uninstalling software. For example, in Mandrake, there is a &quot;Remove Software&quot; program, where you can select the programs you want to uninstall, and it will uninstall them. <br />
As for the directory structure, it can be very difficult to understand at first, and takes a lot of getting used to, but after a while, you get used to the settings being in /etc, the programs being in /usr/bin, the CD drive bring in /cdrom or /mnt/cdrom, and so on. I would agree, however, that this may be one area that Linux needs to improve upon. The short directory names came from the use of the command line in Linux: it's easier to type /etc than to type /Settings. Since there are now pretty good graphical environments for Linux, it may be time to retire some of that, although I don't really see that happening.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Padma</div><div class="date">Oct 17, 2004, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will concede that KDE, on a standard Mandrake (or any other major disto) build, is roughly as bloated as Windows.  Because it tries to be *friendly* to users coming from the Windows world.  Chairman Meow pointed out the fallacy behind Win's Task Manager - there are many processes going on that aren't really showing up there.  Gnome is perhaps not quite so bloated, but it, too, does a lot to make life easier for the user, which adds to the &quot;bloat&quot;. :)<br />
<br />
But that's part of the beauty of Linux!  KDE is too bloated for your taste?  Try WindowMaker, or FVWM, or AfterStep, or FluxBox, etc.  These are much &quot;lighter-weight&quot; window managers.  They don't provide as much &quot;help&quot; to the user as a full blown desktop environment, but they are faster in return.<br />
<br />
As for directory structures, Linux is certainly no worse than Windows.  Everything for a user is found in their &quot;Home&quot; directory, e.g. &quot;/home/padma&quot;.  This corresponds roughly to the &quot;documents and settings&quot; folder in Windows.  Instead of a &quot;windows&quot; directory, the rest of the system belongs to the OS. :eek:  That means the user can't screw up his system, just his own area!  (Yes, the user can switch to superuser mode, and screw with things, but if he doesn't know the root password, he is confined to his own little sandbox.  *MUCH* safer! ;) )<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;where are programs installed?&quot; and &quot;how do I remove them?&quot;, every major distro (particularly those designed with noobs in mind ;) ) has tools, both GUI and command line, for handling this.  For some distros, like Red Hat, and Mandrake, this tool is &quot;rpm&quot;.  For Gentoo, it is &quot;emerge&quot;.  For others it is &quot;apt-get&quot;.  There are other package management tools, as well.  The point is, you use the tools provided.  BTW, programs that use the InstallShield wizard usually have an &quot;Uninstall program&quot; item added to the menu as well. ;)</div></div><hr />

With Gnome, I get 72 running processes. With KDE 60-something.<br />

Padma, be realistic. Uninstalling linux software is like uninstalling spyware on windows. You don't install them always thru rpm. Sometimes source code is used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stormbind</div><div class="date">Oct 17, 2004, 08:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Noting that this would exclude a desktop environment and is therefore not comparible to Windows XP: What are the system requirements for the current version of Xfree86 or X.org? :confused:<br />
<br />
I say the increased number of messages make more difference today. In 1995, X Windows seemed fast, but in 2004 it's a resource hog. As applications become more complex, the number of messages increases exponentially. Every button, checkbox, menu effect, etc. adds several new messages!<br />
<br />
Having an intergrated solution such as WinNT, Haiku, or Syllable does not reduce choice. There are plenty of desktops for Windows, and you can install alternative display systems if you want to. You can install Xfree86 (with cygwin) on Windows; you would need to be insane, but you can do it.</div></div><hr />

I install almost everything through rpm.  The few things I install from source, I *know* where I put it. (/usr/local/bin is usally a good place. ;))<br />
<br />
And even if I didn't know where I put it, how hard is it to type &quot;which &lt;program&gt;&quot; in a terminal?  That tells you where to find it. :)<br />
<br />
@stormbind: All I can say is, from empirical evidence (i.e., my own experience),  my Mandrake/KDE system is faster and more stable than my old Win2000Pro was.  I admit that it may not actually *be* faster, but the perception is there, and in software, perception of speed is what matters. ;)</div></div><hr />
