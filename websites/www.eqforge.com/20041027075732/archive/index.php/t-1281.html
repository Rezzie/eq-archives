There seems to be a problem with the governments... It looks like military units could not enforce martial laws under Mission Command government and Technocracy governemnt. Civil disorders happened very often in the beginning, even though I have two military units stationed in Little America (the city population is 2).</div></div><hr />

Well, that's part of the scenario...you see everyone is panicked...it's the Antarctic and it's cold...let'em party (make entertainers, there's plenty of ice fishing)...since your playing the Americans buy your units, you've got like 12,000 gold...<br />
<br />
Strategy:<br />

Find as many goodie huts as you can...or there will be some Russians and Argentines knocking on your front door...and uh...it's not gonna be pretty if the Argentines show up...they tend to be nasty http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/frown.gif<br />

Hey, <br />

Håkan this one should work fine in your Classic Civ II, I tested it in the Modpack Manager as I do with all of 'em...<br />

I was the Australians and had cleanup the New Zealanders (2 cities) frist and then Russians (2 cities) quite soon after and americans (1city) 2 turns later.  The Argentines put up the only fight even tho I took one of there cities early, they also tied with me in science.  The British did nothing and only had one city.  I was allied with the Antarctians.<br />
<br />
I controlled the east coast and went south around the continent cause the New Zealanders where threating the Antarctians. <br />
15 cities total (including captured cities) 9 that I built my self.<br />
<br />
I had problems with money but that was solved when i took Two Capital Cities.<br />
<br />
I also had problems with getting cities past one but enggineers fix that and supermarkets.<br />

Hey Woke...hmmm...I'll look into it...I'm thinking that actually harbors still require you to be near the ocean though...<br />
<br />
...And SunTzu...I haven't forgotten about Greater Civilizations...it's still getting streamlined...most of it has to do with my redesigning the city screen (I can't handle the old one) and trimming up the units to look very nice...I've been working on the sounds for that patch as a matter of fact to give it a better effect...<br />
<br />
I'm so glad that Antarctica has been well-received...great comments and critique by everyone...I hope to release the full version and a polar modpack here in the next two weeks...<br />

And woke23 you must reinstall civ if you want it back. Then you should use the Modpack Manager.<br />

Around 2025 a huge area of hills popped up where ocean used to be and the hills destroyed &quot;Little America&quot; http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/frown.gif luckily i had already built another city so i wasn't wiped out, i was at war with russai and they had north of my 2nd city covered so all i could do was go and build  in the massive hills....<br />
I'm doing quite good now tho=] still at war with russia, not having that much luck, they have ships and the hills created a lake between my capital city and russia. So they land near me every now and then<br />

<br />
Yes, Woke...I assume you are not using the modpack manager, and that you are using Classic Civ II v.1.08 to 2.42<br />
<br />
All you need to do is reinstall from your Civ CD over the files you have already...this should return your game to normal...you don't have to delete anything it will just prompt you to ask if you're sure you want to do...just click &quot;ok&quot;. &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />
<br />
Hey Håkan:<br />
<br />
Yes, money is meant to be in short supply. This motivates you to kick butt and stay on the move (as you would be in the Antarctic).<br />
Sounds like you're having a great game too...<br />
&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/biggrin.gif&quot; border=0&gt;<br />
<br />
Hi willemvanoranje,<br />
<br />
You know that same thing happened to me when I was playing myself...except, it was the Americans and they offered me 4200 gold to whip the Russians. I took the gold and a few turns later the Russians took &quot;Little America.&quot; Now, remember, in this game, the wonders are not buildable but the ones that exist are also objectives...capture cities with wonders to win...but don't destroy the city or you lose the objective city and the wonder! (2 objective pts!). <br />
<br />
I feel fortunate to have so many veteran players available to test the mod...it gives me a better understanding of what I should include in my readme files.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the support.<br />

That's very encouraging...yes, it is easy for me too, but I'm not a good judge of what is too hard or too easy because I've been playing Civ II for so long...I expect to make the governments more aggressive ...hmm...or at least a couple of them...this might give it better balance in easier levels...<br />

First I encountered the Russian, I conquered them, than later on the other side the Argentines, conquered them too, than the New Zealands, Australian, British and Antarctic. They all had a four cities or less (the British had one, the other one was destroyed early in the game by the Argentines).</div></div><hr />
