It's the first ever done about Ultima Online.<br />
I would like to have someone doing beta-testing, better if he knows Ultima Online.<br />

The thread is in the news page or in the download center in the fantasy menu<br />

I'm not really into Ultima, however I have some vague memories about playing all those old adventure strategy games until late in the morning, like Warlords on the Amiga and such.<br />
<br />
-There's something exciting about a good fantasy game anyway, so I'll give yours a try.<br />
<br />
-I haven't really played your scenario yet, as I was destroyed pretty quickly by &quot;Kaos&quot; the first two games -before ever producing a unit! Then I discovered that &quot;the real&quot; scenario file must be the other one provided, and this works much better.<br />
<br />
-I like your terrain graphics! -and also the innovative concept of using the airbases to artificially &quot;enlarge&quot; cities. looks good on the map.<br />
<br />
-I'll get back later when I've played a little more in the summer holidays.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhye</div><div class="date">May 26, 2001, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The scenario is the file UO_T2A.scn<br />
UO_Begin.scn is a possibily: if you want to start a new game with the UO mod-pack without having to play the scenario.<br />
This is because if you start a new game normally, the game will crash because of the special changes i've made to the tech tree<br />
<br />
I think you used the second file.<br />
Anyway, it needs different rules.txt and title.gif: these files are included (the files ending with &quot;4 UO_BEGIN&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. How could I be more provocative?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhye</div><div class="date">May 26, 2001, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OOOOPS!!!!<br />
I forgot a file<br />
In the UO_BEGIN case, you must use a different events,txt, which I forgot to include<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's the same but the lines with &quot;Random turn - Create unit&quot;<br />
If anyone wants to play from the beginning, he should remove these lines, which are sensed only in UO_T2A scenario</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">May 26, 2001, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People need time to play enough of the scenario to give their comments. Also, you need to edit the title of this thread to include the name of your scenario, something like &quot;Ultima Online, the Second Age - Comments please&quot;. But if you really want some initial reactions.....<br />
<br />
The download file structure is very complicated and not handled properly in the readme.  My suggestions regarding this are:<br />
<br />
1. The game.txt can be used from the scenario folder and doesn't need to be in the Main. Forget about having the Main folder and let the city.gif get copied with the rest of the files to the scenario directory. Then tell the player what to do from there. If he does nothing, the city.gif will do no harm.<br />
<br />
2. Instead have a Begin folder and put files you need to swap to have a begin game in there.<br />
<br />
3. What are the xxx4 files?<br />
<br />
4. The readme is very terrible and is nothing more than some incomplete instructions on how to set up the files and a list of updates. <br />
 <br />
5. There are no instructions regarding the FW scenario file and as far as I know, the describe.txt will not work for FW which will rely on the pedia.txt.<br />
<br />
The last time I played an Ultima game was on an Apple IIe so it would be nice to have some background to what is going on and what you are supposed to do (kill every other race?). Also no credits for stuff made by others or testers if any. I noticed some terrain and the fortify rocks from Temba's Underdark (can't remember if he is the one who originally made them)<br />
<br />
Now about the game (played ony a few turns).<br />
<br />
1. There is a line in the title message that is too long.  &quot;join a world in a continuous trouble?&quot; should be moved to a new line.<br />
<br />
2. I am very impressed with the sounds.<br />
<br />
3. I am very impressed with the map and terrain.<br />
<br />
4. I am very impressed with the units, mostly your own creations?<br />
<br />
5. I am not impressed with the events, your only message is<br />
<br />
TEXT <br />
^Lord British dies in battle.<br />
^Lord Blackthorne self-proclamed king.<br />
ENDTEXT<br />
<br />
You need lots more messages to move the game along and give some flavour to the game. When your events.txt is about 10-15k, that would make the game perfect.<br />
<br />
In summary, other than getting started, seems that the scenario is definitely worth trying out (especially for MGE) from what I've seen and I strongly recommed other people reading this thread to play it.<br />

Thunderfall or JohnV, can you delete this post. I only put it here cause the previous post didn't appear for sometime after I submitted it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhye</div><div class="date">May 27, 2001, 08:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was waiting for a reply like this:<br />
 My answers are:<br />
1)city.gif isn't seen in the scenario directory; game.txt is seen, but when it is in the scenario directory, diplomatic contacts don't work...I don't know why.<br />
2-3)I'll put the files ending with &quot;4 UO_BEGIN&quot; in a \Begin directory<br />
4)I hate long readmes http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/smile.gif<br />
Anyway, I think that Ultima Online itself is a game impossible to explain in a readme - whi already knows it will find no problems in recognizing all the units and the advances. I think the only one thing that's missing is a small description of the things to do.<br />
5)I'll take a look<br />
6)I have no idea of the authors of various small things downloaded from many sites. Anyway, most of terrain is mine or taken from TOT files found on the net (I haven't TOT). The units and the sounds are taken directly from the game, resized, cleaned and adapted to their place in units.gif.<br />
7)Events.txt is a hard matter. In Ultima Online the story is mainly made bby players, and it is different from shard to shard, and it's helped by the quests made by GMs. I can't create a story on my own with Lord British etc., it would be purely imaginary. When you play UO, in most of cases you can do 2 things: 1)Fight; 2)Work<br />
If you work your only objective is to make money. But this way of playing isn't compatible with Civ. Orders and neutrals who fight go to dungeons or defend their cities, sometimes go to Bukka. Kaos try everyday to conquest the other cities. The others tribes are NPCs only.<br />
For these facts, I DON'T KNOW what to write on events.txt: THERE ARE NO EVENTS! <br />
Maybe I'll write this into the readme.txt<br />
<br />
Anyway, thank you for your suggestion, I hope you'll try my next version</div></div><hr />
