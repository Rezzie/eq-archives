Sometimes when I spend large amounts of time on the computer, clicking and clicking away, later on - my fingers (that I use on my trackball) start twitching on their own.  I can just stand there, and my index &amp; middle finger on my right hand start twitching just a little bit.  I guess they just want to keep on clicking!<br />
<br />
This phenomenon only occurs when I've been spending an absurd amount of time on the PC, fortunately.   :D <br />
<br />
Btw, since it's a trackball, I'm using my thumb - so it can get a little twitchy also.   :crazyeye:</div></div><hr />
