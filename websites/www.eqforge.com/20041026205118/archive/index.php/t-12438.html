<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ric Flair</div><div class="date">Dec 18, 2001, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While playing CivII: Test of Time I was well into the future techs in 1944 (Future Tech 165 or so) and after &quot;End Turn&quot; in 1944 I discovered THIRTY-NINE Future Techs before 1945 Unit move phase began! In previous turns I was discovering about 2 techs per turn.<br />
     In this game I am basically trying to max my population, city number and score. To give my engineers something to do I am converting all mountains into other terrain, terraforming the Arctic and Antarctic zones from tundra and glaciers into plains, and irrigating and mining 100% of land squares. So far my score is 10936.<br />
     Has anyone ever had this &quot;glitch&quot; happen in one of their games before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andu Indorin</div><div class="date">Dec 18, 2001, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This phenomenon is known as the &quot;Future Tech Rollover.&quot;  In essense, the program has only 254 or 255 slots available for scientific research.  When you reach future tech 167 (or 168), the scientific research paradigm resets from 32,000 beakers per advance back to the original ten beakers per advance.  Consequently, when attempting to complete the 255 FT maximum, the real challenge is to get to FT 167; past that, the remaining techs can be finished off in as few as 3 or  turns.  <br />
<br />
(And by the way, if you make to 255, make sure you don't get FT 256, because this will wipe out all points for Future Techs.)</div></div><hr />
