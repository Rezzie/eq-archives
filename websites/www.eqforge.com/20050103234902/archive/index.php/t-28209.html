The MP3s are stored on a 32Mb compact flash card that i insert into the device.  the problem is that media player doesn't seem to be able to play the files.  in the help for the media player it says that when Media Player is loaded &quot;it searches your device and storage cards for any music files&quot;.  it certainly does not do this.  it only searches the &quot;my documents&quot; folder.  if i want it to find my MP3s, i have to copy them off the card and into the mydocuments folder.  i cannot copy all the MP3s to the internal memory, because there are too many.  (the internal memory is only 16Mb).  Am i doing something wrong, or is it not working properly?</div></div><hr />

All I can say is stay away from media player.  I got it to play some of mine, but it wouldn't play all of them.  pain in the ass. <br />

Go to zdnet's downloads section and look for players.  I haven't checked for a while, probably have new stuff.</div></div><hr />

i had a look.<br />
unfortunately the only decent free one i could find was media player 7.1.  however, it does work(!) yay!.  when i looked i was using version 3.0 which is prob why it wouldn't work.</div></div><hr />
