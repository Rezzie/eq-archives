<br />
The Colossus and HG affect the city they are built in so if you vote for them please also vote for F or G. G is less risky since Neumatic has accumulated more shields than Doug. However, F will give us a better SSC and we have several vans ready or almost ready so I recommend it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 01, 2003, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Voted A,B,C and F.<br />
<br />
Priority 1 should be HG.  Preferably built in The Donut, but if it is at risk, building it in Neumatic would be far superior to losing it altogether.<br />
<br />
Colossus also in The Donut.  (get those camels walkin'!)<br />
<br />
Neumatic uses its shields toward MPE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 01, 2003, 03:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree and also voted A,B,C,F.<br />
<br />
And I think we should send all camels to Doughnutia and none to Neumatic. Neu has accumulated many shields on it own and it's useful for it not to finish MPE too early - it means we can switch to HG (which is IMO more important) and rush buy it in Neu if the AI suddenly seems to be finishing HG before we can finish it in Doug.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">puglover</div><div class="date">May 01, 2003, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted B and C. Maybe in Doughnutia and Regia Fanatica.</div></div><hr />

This sounds like an excellent plan, and has the full support of the Office of Scientific Research</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dou, switch to HG when Pottery<br />
<br />
One caravan to Dou now (total 178s), set production to 7 for two turns, then to 8 the last turn and HG is complete in 3 turns and one caravan.<br />
<br />
Help PB and RF caravans and send them to Dou. Send already built caravan in LC to Dou. IPRB a caravan in Dou (after HG), and then build Col. If we have money left when Col is built and if needed, we'll IPRB car in LC and help Neu wonder production.<br />
<br />
This way we'll hopefully have the three wonders in 10 turns, and never go under 70g treasury.:)</div></div><hr />

I don't have the game here, but I thought Dough only had about 80-some shields in the box, which means you won't have 178 when you deliver the van.  I thought Neumatic was farther along with 120+ shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GaryNemo</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 10:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dough 88/200<br />
Nuema 128/200<br />
<br />
One Van on River near Dough, another blinking at LC nearby =200<br />
Vans nearly complete in RF, PB, and Ipec (far away!)<br />
Treasury $315, plenty to IPRB several Vans $11 every turn.<br />
<br />
I voted B,C, F Build HG in Doughnutia, then Colossus there.<br />
I understand you all want Colossus, what about Lighthouse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 02, 2003, 10:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funxus' plan looks good. I can add that if we get a message that an AI civ is about to complete one of 'our' wonders and we can't complete it using normal means (rush buy or caravan) there's one emergency measure I recommend: Sell temples. This is not as bad it may seem because once we complete the HG temples are not as important as before.</div></div><hr />

I checked the wrong city in the citylist.</div></div><hr />
