<br />
    WELL AIN'T THAT JUST GREAT !!!!   <br />
They had no problem releasing a game and selling it for $50 with those very &quot;SHOWSTOPPERS&quot; in it.   Am I missing something here?<br />
<br />
<br />
FLAME ON EVERYONE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">promenad</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">calm down, most of us is gonna play this game for the next four years or so, it doesn't really matter if they take a few weeks to get the first patch out. And yes, games are being sold with major showstoppers in them all the time. Look at Diablo II for instance, has been out since june '00 and still contains some major bugs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jghoo</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes I did copy that reply. I felt that the quote was relevent enough to the situation, and indicitive of most game companies out there. AS IN get it out the door, and pick up QC in the patch proccess. <br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. Using an example of your opinion of Diablo 2 IMHO is not justification or a good excuse for post release finnishing of a product. Patches should be for bugs not design flaws. Once again IMHO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As in Civ3 as released works quite well and we've been having lots of fun playing it.  Now they're tweaking and fixing bugs - not show stoppers.<br />
<br />
Then in the attempt to fix certain bugs they found they had created NEW showstoppers with the patch.  Like in tweaking corruption they found that now courthouses can result in negative corruption.  Or in fixing the bombard anywhere on the map bug they created a game crash - stuff like that (made up examples - I have no inside info.)<br />
<br />
So chill out and relax.  If you didn't actually like the game you guys wouldn't care enough to be reading and posting here in the first place.</div></div><hr />
