<br />
Maybe something like a Parliamentary system, with parties and the works.  Party with the majority holds more Parlamentary seats, and can elect it's own members to the government.<br />
<br />
Or, maybe a monarchy.  That would be lots of fun, chosing a monarch, giving people interesting ways of removing him, etc...<br />
<br />
Come on, let's think of something to liven the politics around this place!</div></div><hr />

We'd be spending valuable time and forum-space on matters not directly related to how we want this game to be played.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fier Canadien</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2003, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree about a parlementary system to improve the efficiency of the government.<br />
<br />
Here's my idea:<br />
<br />
http://www.civfanatics.net/uploads4/government.jpg<br />
<br />
The function of the entities are the following:<br />
<br />
Chamer of Commons: Formed of all elected posts (Leader, deputy, chat rep, governors, mayors…). Party based, the leader of the dominant party becomes Prime Minister. The PM chooses a senate formed of CoC members of 4 to 6 persons to lead various inquieries and commissions. All laws, acts and treaties must be voted in the CoC. <br />
<br />
Senate: A non-law related entity, its function is to lead the various commisions and public investigations of the President. They have the power to post a decommision poll against any member of the Government if a public investigation lead to accusations.<br />
<br />
Presidential Office: formed of all non-elected posts, everything of the CoC must pass trought this entity before ratification. The Presidential Office has the right to hold [i]referendi[/] if they feel that a law, act or treaty might be controversial.<br />
<br />
President: Elected independently, the president is party-less. He is the Duty Player and must ratify any law, acts or treaties that the Presidential Office submits to him. He has the power to ask the Senate to proceed to a troughout examination of anything suspect. <br />
<br />
The function of parties: A party can present up to one candidate to each of the Leader, Deputy, Chat rep, Governor and Mayor posts. The Party's leader cannot run for any post. He is appointed as &quot;Prime Minister&quot; if his party holds majority in the CoC. He and his council (his party) are responsible for proposing laws. The opposition can present laws as well, but they are not bound to do so. There is no &quot;line of party&quot; or &quot;veto&quot; power. If there is no party that holds the majority, then the biggest party will be considered as leading party. It will have the duty to propose laws. A CoC Leader shall then be elected to hold the Prime Minister's position. This leader must not be member of any party. If the two most important parties hold the same amount of sieges, there shall be two Prime Ministers, each naming half of the senate and each having the duty to propose laws.<br />
<br />
Just a proposition of a deranged man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vander</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2003, 12:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If we follow that, do we want to limit the number of parties involved?  I think so.  Even if we go by citizen groups that's still six or so.  I think we should cap the party number so that we don't get too spread in our distribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 25, 2003, 12:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These ideas are good for the RPG. But I do not agree on Changing the Structure of the Demogame's Government.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gingerbread Man</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2003, 04:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For a parliamentry situation I would suggest:<br />
<br />
Two houses - House of Representatives, and the Senate. Other branches are the Cabinet and the  High court.<br />
<br />
The house of Reps is made up of the governors. What the house does is create any new law.<br />
<br />
The new law is passed on to the senate. If this were a party system, there would be no parties in the senate. So while the reps may have the Democrats, Republicans, Labor, Liberal (depending on which country you are thinking of...), the senate could not have any.<br />
<br />
The senate cannot introduce laws. they can only pass ones that have been agreed upon, and remove current ones that do not work. In this game, the senate will only be made up of three members of equal power.<br />
<br />
The cabinet (President/Prime Minister, Military, domestic, and all other departments under their control) will run the country, by the will of the people, which will be expressed through the governors.<br />
<br />
The High Court interprets the constitution, and acts upon it. Just the Chief justise, PD, JA.<br />
<br />
So for a law to be passed:<br />
1) Governor proposes a law or idea to be put into practise to the House of Representatives<br />
2) If the house of Reps agrees upon the law/idea, they propose it to the senate of three.<br />
3)The senate of three reviews it to make sure it would work in practise. Their purpose isn't to agree or disagree with it, but just to make sure the law/idea could be done without damaging the game. I stress the no opinion, just if it will work idea.<br />
4) If the senate passes it, it will go to a moderator to sign, and place in the constitution. (like the Governor General in commonwealth countries.)<br />
<br />
If the parliament is not agreeing on anything, the Governor General (moderator) can call a double dissolution. Pretty much, the House of reps and the senate is sacked, and elections are held. The people who were sacked can go for their positions again.<br />
<br />
The senate may remove a law in effect if it is not working, and tell the house of reps to discuss it again, and fix it.<br />
<br />
The problem with this is that the senate doesn't have much to do. So they are also in charge of inter-province issues, e.g. the national highways and railways, bringing fresh water from a distant source, and worker distribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vander</div><div class="date">Jun 26, 2003, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doesn't that limit the actual input of the citizens?  True, they could talk to a governer, but why not get rid of the middle man?  Make the house of reps the people and the senate the governers.</div></div><hr />
