I was thinking of advertising this game in the main page of CFC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Sep 13, 2003, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One idea was to start war-mongering immediately. Maybe we should rush to armor in demofirst, switch to fundy and then take our enemies as fast as we can. I could play the turns in demo soon, maybe tomorrow (important election here tomorrow though...).</div></div><hr />

I don't know why, but it lost a lot of interest for me ; but it's not due to the DG, but sometime, real life take you so much time.... !<br />
(I bought a new home, we prepare every thing for our second child, and so...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Sep 17, 2003, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe we need to try a slightly different format. We could turn it into a multiplayer demogame, but we'd need lots more people. We may find recruits in the MP and PBEM forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zmei-gorynych</div><div class="date">Sep 29, 2003, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">better yet, make it an MP scenario of WWII. Some ppl will be the axis, others the allies, kinda interesting to see who'll actually win</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedBull</div><div class="date">Sep 29, 2003, 07:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The WWII thing doesn't sound bad..I don't think we'd need quite as many/the same cabinet positions though...maybe a president spot, DoD spot, R&amp;D spot, and a &quot;secretary of state&quot; which can handle both domestic and foreign affairs.  Natually each side would need each four, so instead of needing 10 cabinet members total, we'd only need 8.  Maybe have actual negotiations on here between the two sides such as a cease fire in a given area only, or agreements not to attack here and there, whatever.  Also, we might need to break this down into three forums...one for general things which is open to both sides, one for the Axis and one for the Allies, both needing passwords to enter.  Citizens would need to declare which side they favor...but every time someone leaves one side or something of that nature, we'd have to change the password.  That's the only downside I see to it, but it's nothing we can't deal with as long as an e-mail network is kept alive.<br />

Sounds like cool beans in the early stages to me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Sep 29, 2003, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think more people is going to happen; at least not for any sort of sustained period.<br />
<br />
Each game we start with more players than we end with.  Each new game starts with less players than the game before it.  Each game has ended (ending) with a skeleton crew.<br />
<br />
I would rather have the next game not start than have it die halfway through.<br />
<br />
If we wanted to do the WWII scenario (which, if we did, I would want us to use the ZWK scenario since it is very Multiplayer friendly) I might be able to handle playing the three allied players against the group playing the two Axis players (or vice-versa).</div></div><hr />

And we could always start more Succession games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds good to me.  :D <br />
<br />
By the time I check the Demo game someone else made the advice I wanted to offer.<br />
<br />
Three thoughts -- I'm hooked into a &quot;Demogame&quot; over at 'Poly for MOO2 -- but it is zoooooming along;  my first recommendation is to speed up this game if it seems that interest begins to wane (after all, it does look like a won game).<br />
<br />
The second is to shift up the votes and parameters a notch -- ask for strategic decisions (wartime tech path through howies?)  Who to take out next?<br />
<br />
Final thought might be to wind this down AS a succession game -- rotate four turns at a time through the remaining citizens with appropriate comments, screen shots and advice.<br />
<br />
Good job for the partipants to date -- I've enjoyed reading up &amp; learning about many of the early thoughts.  :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raiderbob</div><div class="date">Nov 01, 2003, 01:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Involve everyone? I’m new, but isn’t there a way everyone can play? Ever watch someone else play a computer or video game? Boring isn’t it? About the only thing worse, is some new guy that comes along with stupid ideas, wanting to change everything!<br />
<br />
   Being new and inexperienced, I’d be willing to wait for the last settler produced. I’d do irrigation, mining, for the supporting city before I left, and roadwork en route to freedom. Then let me build my own city, be the mayor, subject to the chain of command of course! <br />
   Or let me be a horseman! Say, “go explore north”; I might even tip a hut that has an advanced tribe! Or if I screw up and get killed.. maybe I get demoted to a warrior garrisoned, fortified at the palace.. And it would add a little more realism, people screw-up! Or give me a ship. a dip and a horse and let me explore!<br />
<br />
   Yeah the logistics of everyone moving just their entity, saving the game, returning it to central command or e-mailing it to the next in line… and then you’ve got co-coordinated attacks etc., but that’s why you’ve got chain of command, your superior moves if you miss your turn or disobey orders/incompetence... hey you guys are the experts!<br />
<br />
   I signed up for the last one as an observer, and really enjoyed it because it was like an ongoing tutorial… I learned so much! But real life has its priorities and when I got back, I was lost. Add to that the probability that I’d never get to actually play…(what are the odds of a newbie being president?)<br />
  But a mayor from a small out post might become a governor, a deputy domestic advisor, cabinet member… based on merit. A warrior (private?) might advance to command a squad, platoon, company… deputy military advisor.. at least be able to show ability/ or not, in a small way.<br />
<br />
But like I said, I’m new.. This was probably all hashed out before, but I couldn’t find any references…<br />
<br />
just a thought... peace</div></div><hr />

How about the demogames moving faster?  As a suggestion, play along with the next Civ II GOTM.  A bit of a spoiler for people playing in that, but might be manageable.:)<br />

Being a newbie isn't really a problem, bu we actually don't have that many turns left to play, and it'll probably be the last game unfortunately.:(</div></div><hr />

Most people don't seem to be able/willing to play through a game as it is.  The biggest issue I have heard about is that game moves too slowly, making it multi-site would only increase the time between turns that much more. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a multi-site demogame about 18 months ago between CFC, GC and Poly (GC won very quickly if I remember correctly). The second game never got off the ground - probably because the first CivIII MSDG started. There's currently two CivIII demogames these sites are involved in. ( http://cdgroup.org are hosting them)<br />
<br />
I suppose there's nothing to stop you finding out what sort of interest other sites might have in participating in a game, but you'd need to be prepared to put in the time organising it.</div></div><hr />
