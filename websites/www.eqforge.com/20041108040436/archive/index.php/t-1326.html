But ofcourse you can't do that unless you have a strong position in the Quadrant, and you need technologie from other races to get the final tech. How you do that is up to you, conquering or negotiating. There are techs for each civ which give it access to Special Weapons; Omega Weapon, Premonition-class, Jach'Eng-class, Phoenix-class.<br />

The tech tree is completely redesigned, I just have to put it in the rules.txt. The goal of the scenario is changing, it won't stop after 'Galaxy Jumping' is researched, but it'll end with building a galaxy-jump-spaceship or just conquest. The partisan (Trade Ship) is going to be an Escape Pod, and there are going to be more wonders available. <br />

<br />
Comments so far: I'm playing on FW as Fed and have experimented for a few turns so far. It seems that even on Prince Level the unhappiness is very high. I have to have more than half my guys as entertainers to even send one ship out.<br />
<br />
Another curious thing is that there is an invisible sovereign at the beginning which only appears if you use the arrow keys to make it move. Thereafter, it warps the map around it as it goes about. Don't know if this is to do with using FW.<br />
<br />
Isn't Dukat Dead?<br />

<br />
to kobayashi:<br />
About the Sovereign, I had that problem as well, but it didn't show up in v2.0. I had the same problem in your Dominion scenario once; I was 'travelling' with a Galaxy-class starship near the Cardassian border, and over sudden, it was gone!<br />

Please read the manual to find out how to debug this file. I'm testing with MGE, but this shouldn't be a problem, as I tested Kob's work with it and he designed in FW. You could have the Voyager as a special unit, to reflect the weapons tech it picked up over the years, but remember, The Voyager's federation tech is at least Seven years behind Starfleet standard, and the Enterprise E is the ultimate expression of Federation technology. All Throughout the Voyager seriers, it is apparent that Federation tech is superior to what the ship incountered in the Delta quadrant, so it stands to reason that the Soverigns would be more powerful then even the souped-up Voyager.<br />

Voyager has many upgrades, and has some Borg technology. Tom Paris exceeded Warp 10 at least two times (that was the episode today), and I don't see the Enterprise E doing that. Voyagers weapons systems and shield are very strong, now, because of foreign (Borg) technology; Voyager is able to destroy some Borg vessels (not all types). Federation tech may be behind on severale things, but some things are more developed (Warp 10).<br />
<br />
I believe, the Sovereign-class is stronger than the Intrepid-class in my scenario, isn't it? But I ensure you, I will change the strenght of the Intrepid, I see your point and you are right!<br />
<br />
Further I want to say I'm not sure v.2.1 will come soon. I'm afraid I catched the flue and I'm feeling really bad right now. Don't be surprised if I'm not browsing the boards for a couple of days.<br />

The values now are: Intrepid class, 12/10*/5 3/2, and the value for Sovereign Class, 10/6/4 2/2, so you see, you have a class of light cruisers more powerful then heavy cruisers. I don't disagree with the Intrepids being faster, but even with weapon upgrades, I doubt Voyager could take on The Enterprise E on even terms. When Voyager was lost in the Delta Quadrant, she was equipped with Photon torpedoes and phasers. During the Dominion war (which Voyager missed), the Federation reequiped it's fleet with Quantum Torpedoes and new improved Phasers. Also, any tech Voyager aquirred could be sent to starfleet by way of the link that Barclay established in last season's episodes, so the Federation could install such tech in it's latest types, but it couldn't go the other way, since there are no Star Fleet Shipyards for Voyager to be converted in. This is just my opinion, so feel free to ignore this if you want. It's just what I think about it. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

There was a side effect to Warp 10 you know.  Accelarated evilution, I mean evolution. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />
<br />
The Sovereign-class (Although an ugly ship in my mind) is the &quot;Dreadnought&quot; (Strongest Ship) of the Federation, and Voyager (Intrepid Class) is and exploration ship.  Probably light-heavy cruiser class.  According to http://www.ditl.org/  (one of the best ST info sites I've seen)  The Soveregin is about 6 times stronger than the Intrepid.  The Soveregin is also faster than the Intrepid (Warp 9.985 for 1 hour-Intrepid  Warp 9.99 for 36 hours-Soveregin)<br />
<br />
Although Voyager now has Borg weapons and enhanced systems (And a better EMH/ECH http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif) it's Type VIII Phasers are nothing the the Soveregin's Type XII.  Also Voyagers 36 torpedos compared to the Soveregin's 1100 http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/eek.gif<br />
<br />
Picard would annialate Janeway in about 10 seconds http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif  But for an &quot;explorer/long range reconnance&quot; class ship...Voyager is very strong.  And more responsive computer because of the Bioneural gel packs (although the biological nature of the packs has led to problems such as infection. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif)<br />
<br />
I would give the crew advantage to Voyager though.  The Enterprise hasn't been in as many unique situations as Voyagers crew.  Both have former Borg Crew members.....but in the heat of battle Picards bald head would shine and partially blind his crew http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 17, 2001, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm starting over with version 2.1.<br />
<br />
Firstly, the error message at the start of the scenario is still there. I did a debug and it seems there is an illegal citytaken event relating to the race Klingons.<br />
<br />
Second question. Why is there an Events2 file and does it serve any purpose?<br />
<br />
Third. Was there some mention of a theme music. I didn't hear any?<br />
<br />
I can build every ship of every race right at the beginning. It wasn't like this in the earlier version. Is this supposed to be?<br />
<br />
The invisible space warping sovereign (the one on the left) is still there. Suggest you delete it and create a new one.<br />

But that doesn't matter, I'll send you the new one tomorrow (April 18). <br />
About terrain changes by events. They don't seem to work when I try to use them.<br />

I had that at first as well, but I fixed that. At least, it doesn't show up on my computer anymore (maybe I should send you the newest again?).<br />
<br />
The events2.txt had a purpose in version 1.x, but it hasn't got a function anymore. You can delete it.<br />
<br />
I had the same thing with music. But I thought it had something to do with my computer. John said he could hear them. Maybe it's not the right .wav-format (if it excists).<br />
<br />
Yes, it's supposed so that you can't build every ship. I didn't like it and every race has it's own ships. It's strange that the Feds can build D'Deridexes and I shouldn't have done it in the first place.<br />
<br />
I found out that it changes every time. I started it today and the Sovereign was OK, but yesterday it was doing weird again. Does anyone know how this can happen?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2001, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Klingon City - there's no problem except for the error message before the game starts. All I can say is add the debug command at the top of the events file and read what it says when you run the scenario.<br />
<br />
I mean with the version I have now (supposedly 2.1 but I could be wrong) I can build everything. I am building borg cubes in all my cities now.<br />
<br />
As for the wierd thing, I experienced an invisible ship once when I changed the terrain (which had units) via the events file. I suggest just destroying it and putting a new one in a nearby square.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2001, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was quite sure I overwrote the files in the order you sent me. I must have made a mistake somewhere. <br />
<br />
Why don't I download 2.0 which is posted at civfan and then you send me any new files you have. That will help reduce the size of whatever you send me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Apr 18, 2001, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok! I just sent you the rules.txt, events.txt and the kappa.scn. I don't think anything else has been changed since 2.0<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kobayashi</div><div class="date">Apr 27, 2001, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've played quite a number of turns now of 2.0+. I'm now at the stage where I have placed a city on eitherside of the wormhole and made friends with the Kra. All the previous problems I mentioned didn't turn up so I'll start from scratch again.<br />
<br />
The overall look and feel is quite good and the Map is splendid. In fact, the map is the best part of Kappa and makes it completely unique. But I think there is way too much food everywhere and its hard to stop the cities from mushrooming into disorder very quickly.<br />
<br />
My absolute favourite unit is the probe. You paradrop it out and then reel it back and see eveything inbetween. One suggestion would be to make to make it a 'plane' and change the movement allowance to be the same as the paradrop distance. But it works fine as it is now.<br />
<br />
Messages, such as the paradrop in the Game.txt need to be updated. Labels, such as the 'airbase' terrain movement need to be updated too. <br />
<br />
One more suggestion regarding the messages revealing where the other tribes are. Have you considered creating a probe (or invisible air unit that dies the next turn etc.) from each race at the location to be revealed via the events instead of using north/sout/east/west coordinates?<br />
<br />
From what I've seen so far, I recommend anyone who has yet to try the scenario to give it a go.<br />
<br />
More later.<br />

I will change the probe thing, and the food as well. How about money? Do you make profit? Is it big. In the beginning I had a lot of trouble with that; the loss was about 1000 every time, so I increased the trade to (I think it was) 2. Ofcourse the labels will change as well as the game.txt. <br />
<br />
The final update must be perfect, so every one who noticed even the smallest error/mistake, please tell me!<br />

<br />
Some unit shield placings that were still wrong are fixed<br />
I made 4 different city.gif's (just changed some colors) and added a batch program so the switching will go easily. The  city.gifs are for the Borg, Federation, Romulan and Klingon. If I remember correctly the original one was designed by kobayashi.</div></div><hr />
