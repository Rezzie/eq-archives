<br />
Assuming you don't have a backup :eek:, just copy it from someone else's machine (that uses the same version of Win98 as you).  You might search for that filename on the Internet... many places have replacement files online.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I searched at MSN but they couldn't find anything that match my search though. Also how can I check which version I have so I can find someone with it?</div></div><hr />

I searched 5 general engines, and did not find a match for that filename.  I have never heard of it before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right-click on My Computer and choose properties. It should say what version you're using.</div></div><hr />

Did you try searching the MS Knowledgebase at www.microsoft.com?</div></div><hr />

I've got Win98 and I don't have it on my computer and when I performed a google-search it didn't show up with any results.....</div></div><hr />

If you delete it, it should end up in there......</div></div><hr />
