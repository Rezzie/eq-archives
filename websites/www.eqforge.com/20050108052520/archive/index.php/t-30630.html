<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Aug 25, 2002, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't see any reason it shouldn't, although I think your CPU may be a little underpowered for high-speed burning.  I would, however, always recomend that you go with an internal CDRW.  When you have an external one connected to a USB connected with PCI it multiplies the number of things that can go wrong, and you'll likely end up with a plenty of coasters.  An internal CDRW will also save you some cash, and that's always a good thing.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Also get some decent burning software.  A few vendors package their burners with good software (like Lite-On), but for the most part you'll end up with a real pile of rubbish like Adaptec or Roxio Easy CD creator.  If you want to do some serious burning, get a good one like Nero Burning ROM, CloneCD, Fireburner, or CDRwin.  <br />
<br />
My pick:  Nero Burning ROM.  I use it for everything but CCD.</div></div><hr />
