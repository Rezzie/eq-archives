Well if you get Global Warming, you can most likely kiss about 1/2 of your good city squares goodbye all across your nation. It's a killer for sure.......everyone starves and it takes years upon years to get your cities back to where they were pre-GW....if ever.</div></div><hr />

Not just any WAR, But NUCLEAR WAR! Me and the Russians have allied against the Zulus, Mongols, and Aztecs. I have cause Global warming by launching massive nuke attacks against the mongols who i invaded at 1400AD.<br />
I have nearly taken their Southern Empire. The Aztecs don't pose a threat because they're not near me.<br />
The Zulus have been using Cruise missles against me. I have nuked their Major cities and coastal cities near my coast.<br />
I am going to take the mongols southern empire then land on the Zulus.<br />
Wish me luck!<br />

&quot;Do you worry that you're not liked <br />
How long till you break <br />
You're happy cause you smile <br />
But how much can you fake&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My mother's always tried to change herself<br />
She never learned to let things be<br />
She doesn't know how bad she messed me up<br />
Cause now she seems so fake to me<br />
But I love her&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When shadows paint the scenes<br />
Where spotlights used to fall<br />
And I'm left wondering<br />
Is it really worth it all?&quot;</div></div><hr />

How do you get around this - just bribe them with gifts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jkp1187</div><div class="date">Sep 05, 2004, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do like the multi-color unit idea...though that'd be easier to pull off with Civ II style units, with the &quot;national shield&quot; showing the nation's color more than the style of units in Civ III.  <br />
<br />
One of the problems is that with 32 civs (and thus, 32 colors,) it's hard to come up with enough colors that are obviously different.  On the other hand, it's clear by looking at the edit file that the game designers didn't even try to make some civs even slightly different colors.</div></div><hr />
