They then attempted to nuke a just-founded city, but MONGOL SDI PROTECTS IT!!!  I was getting ready to go to war against them!  Sioux loses- 3 nukes, all wasted on the same city, of course.<br />
After these attacks, while it's still their turn and before I've had a chance to move my units, they propose a ceasefire, then a peace.<br />
The reason I think for such a short war- while at war with the Babylonians, the Sioux lost enough units to push me into the &quot;Supreme&quot; position, making them hate me.  Then the game registered units they built that turn, pushing them back above me in power.  I nearly soiled my pants when I saw the Sioux were sneak-attacking.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">temurleng</div><div class="date">Oct 07, 2004, 07:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont remember where, but I read somewhere that power is calculated by adding up the offensive and defenseive values of all your units.  Where-ever i read that was unclear on some things:<br />
1- is veteran status calculated?<br />
2- are no combat units calculated?<br />
<br />
If one's power rating is not determined by military power, than what is?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it was very helpful and it was always a question I'd been thinking.<br />
<br />
But, when I said &quot;power&quot; what I was referring to was where it ranks you from between &quot;Supreme&quot; and &quot;pathetic&quot; on the F3/Diplomacy screen.  Those two lines at the top of the F3 screen (power and reputation) are what I always pay attention to, since they seem to greatly influence when AI's will sneak attack.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">temurleng</div><div class="date">Oct 14, 2004, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">only after reading a bunch of posts about why some players build only a few cities (6-15 seems to be the norm) did I finally realize the significance of pop on power.  why unit A/D factors has no impact, I dont know.  I mean, china has a huge pop, but only when it started modernizing its military did nations start raising a stink.  and the US is (relative to its land size) underpopulated, but its the military that gives it its supreme position.  oh well, i guess thats the way civ works...</div></div><hr />
