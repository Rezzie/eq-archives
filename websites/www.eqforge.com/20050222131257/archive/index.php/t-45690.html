<br />
Demogames seem to be a great mod-pool lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">duke o' york</div><div class="date">Mar 07, 2003, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everybody. I'm just popping in to see how things are going along and it seems you're onto a third game already! :goodjob:<br />
I know this is in the wrong place, but I didn't want to enter OT because it might lead to all kinds of spammy speculation about a more permanent return. Instead, this is just to say that I haven't forgotten CFC, and the wonderful Civ 2 fanatics especially. I'll try to return as soon as possible but without regular net access then it's a little tough. Even my parents now have a computer, but I still don't. :( <br />
I really ought to visit them more often. ;)<br />
<br />
On-topic, I'd like to congratulate Duke for finally getting around to one of the recommendations I made when I disappeared from CFC. Jayne has become very valuable to the Demo game, and I'm sure that her general Civ play has improved as a result. I certainly hope it has! She'll do a great job I'm sure, as she has done as Presidnet for so long.<br />
<br />
Well I'm sorry that this visit has been so brief but I'm off to meet my girlfriend and then maybe I'll crush those Babylonian upstarts who have the nerve to send catapults to my continent! :nya:<br />
Take care everybody, and I'll be back when I can. Well done Jayne again. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Mar 09, 2003, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great to see you again, duke!! :goodjob:<br />
<br />
Come back soon!:D</div></div><hr />
