I think we should find out which tech to research next. I believe we should research to Currency or Constructon. We already have enough military techs for what we need to start a war so lets get far ahead with this plan I made up.<br />
First we should buy Alphabet from someone (preferably Apolyton- they're Commercial) then research Mathematics (big $$$$ tech) and sell it for all our opponents have (techs and $$$(money perferably) ) and use 100% for Construction or Currency. I have done this in my personal games and it worked quite fine. BTW along the way we have to buy Writing from someone for more trading options after Mathematics is found. With that tech I have bought the whole tech chart on Monarch level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we reasearch those 6 technologies and sell them to everyone (which would make us a good amount of $$$) we would still have to buy over 15 technologies from the AI. It might be much easier to make a rush for litature ( Just 3 technologies) and then we get all of them for free. Letting us drop down science to fill in are coffers. <br />

Should have let me create the game... I always get good starting spots ;) <br />

I really like this queue, Fier.  Early conquest will be key in this game, even if we ultimately plan for a peaceful victory.  Let's hope there is some Iron nearby.</div></div><hr />

I know... I don't see how Shaitan expects me to have a reasonable discussion and poll this. <br />

I haven't see the AI go up all the way to monarchy... but I've see it go up to where it's the next tech intill it switch's off.</div></div><hr />

CT and I are currently talking about making a huge boost in researching. Pump it up as high as we can afford and get those 5 technologies as fast as possible.

Not really.... Dave, CT, and I was talking about it in the chat... and both CT and I believe that we can get it a a much more resonable time then 40 turns and Dave even thinks we can get it in 25 turns.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you qualify for that title any more, amirsan. At a minimum you're a DG2 vet. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, people's reactions to your suggestion have nothing to do with your demogame seniority. Techs are one of those areas where every person has a (pretty rigid) idea of what should be where and how to go about doing it. Stress the merits of your idea, adjust where needed to make it attractive to more people, and you'll do fine with it.</div></div><hr />

The Great Library is THE MOST important wonder during the ancient age's. Build it and get every tech free up into education. It's effects will last longer than the money that selling currency etc. will give us. Also Writing give us several key technologies. Map Making to increase trade and give coastal cities increased growth. Litature for libries and the Greay Library. The Code Of Laws for courthouse's.... The best corruption fighter there is. And philsophy... The next step intill Republic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tend to agree, but the first few middle age techs are significantly more expensive, and can be obtained via the great library.  Since we are not scientific, we will fall behind briefly at the start of the middle ages unless we are just way ahead.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but it is LESS diffucult and more PROFITABLE with the great library.... We also don't run the risk of falling behind inside of the ancient age's and then going behind even worst when we hit the middle age's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being behind in the middle ages is not such a bad thing.  Unless the AI beelines to military tradition before we even get feudalism there's not much to worry about.  Trading opportunities will exist in the middle ages and there's always theory of evolution to aim for if we are still behind in tech then.  The trouble with the Great Library is that having it tends to make us lose sight of not only the tech queue but trading as well.  By having to make some effort to remain competitive in the tech race we will not only stay on top of trading possibilities we will be forced to keep our goals in front of us while we actively pursue them.  That is much more beneficial than sitting around on our behinds waiting for the tech we need to fall in our laps!</div></div><hr />
