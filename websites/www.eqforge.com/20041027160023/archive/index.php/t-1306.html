<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marko</div><div class="date">Mar 12, 2001, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Struggle For Europe will be released next week. <br />
For people who aren't familiar with the project, here is short summary:<br />
<br />
Since September 1999 I have been working with &quot;THE STRUGGLE FOR EUROPE&quot; Civ2 MGE scenario about WW2 in European Theatre. The scenario allows you play as the leader of Axis, Allies, Soviet Union, France, Finland, Sweden, Turkey, Spain, Jugoslavia or Neutrals (Switzerland, Portugal and Ireland during last half of the scenario). Also multiplayer versions are created. You can start from any point of war from May 1940 to May 1945. <br />
<br />
In order to make managing the scenario (without sounds more than 15MB - scenario has 234 events, 65 rules and 13 units files) as easy as possible for player I have created a  .BAT file with system of menues which manages everything. <br />
<br />
There are 10 different dates which you can choose as starting time for the game: <br />
<br />
May 1940 – &quot;Battle for France&quot;<br />
July 1940 – &quot;Battle for England&quot;<br />
June 1941 – &quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot;<br />
November 1941 – &quot;Battle of Moscow&quot;<br />
July 1942 – &quot;Battle of Stalingrad I &quot;<br />
November 1942 – &quot;Battle of Stalingrad II&quot;<br />
July 1943 – &quot;Battle of Kursk&quot;<br />
June 1944 – &quot;Operation Overlord&quot;<br />
December 1944 – &quot;Battle of Bulge&quot;<br />
May 1945 – &quot;The End of Axis&quot; <br />
<br />
There is created as realistic as possible war situation in Europe for each starting date in three versions: for playing as Axis (Soviet Union and United Kingdom are overstrenghted), as Allies or Soviets (Axis is overstrenghted) or as minor nation or multiplayer (relative strenghts of nations are more realistic). So there are 30 .SCN files in scenario.  <br />
<br />
There are 10 nations you can chose to play but only 7 are present in each starting point of course. Axis, England, Soviet Union, France, Spain, Jugoslavia and Neutrals are present at May 1940. July 1940 France is named to Vichy France. June 1941 Jugoslavia is replaced by Turkey. November 1942 Vichy France is replaced by Finland and May 1945 Axis is replaced by Sweden. <br />
All nations are playable but for example playing as Jugoslavians is extremely hard. <br />

Don't drop your project! More WW2 scenarios the better! <br />
Try to do it as different as possible from others. Every scenario creator has his own concepts and ideas and every player his own taste. <br />
Only use MOVEUNIT command often, it really improves the AI much. http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/biggrin.gif</div></div><hr />

It would be worth the downlaod. But how are you going to arrange it? Is it going to be one mass downlado or, 1 for each starting date. I really hate multiple downlaods. There a pain to confugure. Also make them play &quot;as is&quot;.<br />
i don't like to mess around changing events files and stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kob don't worry, i going to really like yur sceanrio, keep up your good work!<br />

Can't wait for the full version to come out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SunTzu</div><div class="date">Mar 19, 2001, 10:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well about the arrangement, i think i'd be best to maybe have it arranged to download by which country you'd play as. And then seperate the sounds into 5 different download files 3mb each file.<br />
Marko my emails i sent you about what i think should be done to the scenario on the german side are you gonna add those to the game before releasing or release the version you have ready?<br />
But yeah right now on Marshal level it's incredibly hard. BUT FUN! http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/biggrin.gif<br />

Well, it must be close to the Armageddon. Lord, you know that I won’t fly by that lesson you taught me, to pull out my Wesson you brought me, and i’m not stressin’ it softly. Get ‘em up off me, ‘cause all we wanted harmony, been bombin’ ‘em. Yell up outta my ghetto, “I won’t settle,” get on my level.&lt;/FONT c&gt;&lt;/FONT f&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marko</div><div class="date">Mar 20, 2001, 08:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I plan to release the scenario in following zip files:<br />
<br />
Events.zip - 614 Kb - events<br />
Icons.zip - 351 Kb - icons, terrain etc<br />
Rules.zip - 579 Kb - rules<br />
Scen1.zip - 669 Kb - .scn files<br />
Scen2.zip - 682 Kb - .scn files<br />
Txt.zip - 386 Kb - game.txt, readme.txt etc<br />
Units.zip - 585 Kb - units<br />
<br />
All these files (unzipped 18,5 MB) will go to scenario folder.<br />
<br />
Sound1.zip - 1,86 MB<br />
Sound2.zip - 1,72 MB<br />
Sound3.zip - 2,23 MB<br />
<br />
Sound files (unzipped 8,94 MB) will go to Sound folder.<br />
<br />
Everything is very easy for player. There is no need to make any specific subfolders for different versions or backup files. Before starting the scenario or continuing saved game player needs only run Europe.bat file and the program set up right version. <br />
<br />
I can make country-specific .zip files (for playing as Axis, Allies, Soviets, minor nation, multiplayer) but they will be relativly small because only events, rules and sometimes .scn files are different among these versions.<br />
<br />
SunTzu: <br />
Thank you for your playtesting (also other playtesters)! I spend all my time now in making last improvements to the scenario. All suggestions and comments are taken account.</div></div><hr />
