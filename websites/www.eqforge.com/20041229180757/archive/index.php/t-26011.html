Does anyone know where I can get a German language spelling/grammar checker for MS Office XP.  The disc only comes with the English(obviously), french and spanish dictionaries.  I often need to type documents in german and could really do with this.</div></div><hr />

You can use OpenOffice, which has German Support, and it is free.  <br />
<br />
It is in the freeware thread, here. (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?postid=348056#post348056)</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately  the download was 49MB.  Maybe when i have broadband i'll take a look.  Thanks for telling me about it though.<br />
<br />
You would think the MS site would be the place to go - but i can't find anything on their site, ever.  I look again though.</div></div><hr />
