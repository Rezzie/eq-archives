Unfortuneatly, there's nothing to debate.  Microsoft sucks hairy rectum...simple as that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the Salon.com article:<br />
<br />
<br />
But what if it's not all puffery? What if Microsoft does manage to build a foolproof Palladium and deploy it to 100 million users? Those questions elicit the really troubling scenarios. &quot;If Microsoft has its way, there just won't be any open-source software,&quot; says Perens, referring to the thriving ecology of software development in which users freely share code and constantly modify each other's applications. Perens is convinced that Palladium will let Microsoft decide which applications can run on a machine and which are simply too unsafe for public consumption -- such as programs written by open-source hackers. Perens even thinks that's the point of Palladium: &quot;It's designed to kill off open-source development.&quot; <br />
<br />
Open-source hackers aren't the only ones who are worried. Palladium could also significantly strengthen digital rights management (DRM) -- the ability of media companies to manage the content you play on your machine. At least in concept, critics say, Palladium could prevent the unauthorized copying of media of any kind, not only shutting off the MP3 file-sharing free-for-all but also interfering with the rights of consumers to make personal copies of music or movies that they purchased legitimately. <br />
<br />
Could Palladium function as a kind of technological straitjacket, a Redmond-operated remote control over your data and, in consequence, your life? According to those who've looked closely at the proposal, the answer is a definite, unhelpful &quot;maybe.&quot; But the better question is this: Why would Microsoft want to build such a restrictive system?</div></div><hr />

Too many white boxes now and too much influence of Hammer, Athlon, Embedded PowerPC etc. to worry too much about Palludium ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hammer is from AMD, and AMD agreed to implement the Palladium!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jul 18, 2002, 08:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Earlier this year, they got Sen. Ernest &quot;Fritz&quot; Hollings, the South Carolina Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, to introduce a bill that could provide them with some measure of legislative safety. Hollings' bill, the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act  (CBDTPA), would require virtually all electronic devices, from CD players to PCs, to include copy-protection mechanisms. And now, say critics of Palladium, Microsoft is offering a computer system designed to satisfy the Hollings bill, a system that has at its heart what Ross Anderson, a Cambridge computer scientist, calls the &quot;Fritz chip.&quot;<br />
 <br />
Damn that Fritz.  Hollywood and the RIA (Recording Industry) have too much sway.  <br />
<br />
What this means is that your PCs of the future will NOT play your MP3's, if teh Liberals like Hollings get their way.  This also can easily mean your HARDWARE will control whether or not your PC will even listen to your mouse click to open your game, run a word procesor, even activate Explorer.   <br />
<br />
If MS does not want you to do something, you can't do it.  You do it their way, or go into your own private, single computer, non-connected world.  MS and the liberals will command you, make you bow, and demand tribute... you will comply or not compute.  Make no mistake, this is exactly MS's goal.  I know people there (some are actually friends, BTW).  <br />
<br />
People should not underestimate this.... MS is not going to come right out and tell the public &quot;We will control all software, music, movies, PCs, hardware, etc. in 8 years.&quot;  But that is exactly what they are attempting to do, in house.<br />
<br />
Think Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler.   You are Naive Neville and MS/Gates is the evil Hitler.  Bill/Hitler both realize(d) that people can easily be made to walk into Palladium/Gas Chambers without even so much as a fight, if it is done wile making empty promises.    Like those that thought they were just taking a shower, many PC users are being given a bath by big brother Bill.<br />
<br />
And evidently that jerk Hollings is a willing stooge for Bill &amp; RIA.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But we will resist..<br />

Of course, I'll need one hell of a firewall(not MS) to keep them from installing stuff. Not to mention picketing MS ;)<br />
<br />
Speaking of installing stuff, I got a message popup from gator that said 3 things: That the popup occured because there was gator software on my computer, that it occured because they have a new policy, and that the advertisements I see are not from the sites I'm visiting. WHAT KIND OF (censored) INSTALL (censored) ON PEOPLES COMPUTERS!!! Not ony that, they have the nerve to not only tell me that they are responsible for the annoying ads I always see from gator and that they installed stuff without my permission, but they decide to pop up (censored) just to tell me that they changed their (censored) policy :mad: How about my policy: Keep your (censored) of my computer!!! :mad: :mad: :mad: :mad:<br />

<br />
I looked at a hammer website and didn't see anything about palladium. I think I hate m******ft as much as you do (in fact I am not legally allowed to tell you why because of some non-disclosure agreements I signed), but it may turn out that they make some hammer processors palladium-capable and others without. I don't know their plans.<br />
<br />
I'll ask for clarification from my friend.<br />
<br />
I agree with everyone that we need to control out own machines, and I don't trust m******ft, but they may not be able to control everything if there are alternatives.<br />
<br />
Remember, the whole weight of the government and NSA was behind the Clipper Chip and it lies rotting in its grave.</div></div><hr />

I like MS....a lot easier than using Linux or UNIX, but I am not about to kid myself into thinking MS products are more secure than others. I am also not about to kid myself into the whole &quot;down with MS&quot; group.<br />

They aren't that bad.  I was thoroughly impressed with XP Pro. <br />
<br />
Ya, I'm impressed with all the included spyware they installed during my windows update.  I'm impressed with Windows Media player spying on my computer sending all my info back to the mothership.<br />
<br />
I hate MS.  I loved them at first, but if you get stepped on so many times, you turn.<br />
<br />
I have a trial version of Lindows that I'm going to be beta testing tonight.  God, I hope it runs my games well.</div></div><hr />
