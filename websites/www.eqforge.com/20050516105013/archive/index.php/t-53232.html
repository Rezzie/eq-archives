We have lost 3 warrior units to barbarian attacks and have been very unlucky in this. Our remaining units are exploring and garrisoning. Our cities are producing military units at the moment too.</div></div><hr />

@Falcon02 - Ok, you are scaring me now ;). How did you sneek into my computer and decoded the Crypted message I stored away ;). <br />
<br />
Seriously, that is what I am bound to do. Stock pile Warriors and upgrade them to Legonares when we get Iron Working and a source of Iron :).</div></div><hr />

This way we would get quite a nice upperhand quicly and then destroying them with our legionarys would be easy..<br />
<br />
BTW: It would also be nice to explore other places on a pure iron search...</div></div><hr />

That's only a viable option if we also have cash for upgrading.</div></div><hr />

We will need to start thinking of keeping some warriors near our cities to eliminate &quot;fog of war.&quot;  The time is fast approaching where those little barb camps will spring up in the shaded areas of our map, thereby diverting our attention from more important things.  It would be nice to station some warriors on mountains so that we shed light on as much land as possible and keep these uprisings at bay.<br />
<br />
Remember, this doesn't have to be done right this minute, but we need to start a gameplan for this now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is if we are lucky enough to find the land bridge. It may be a contenent, who knows. That is why I am pushing for more Warriors to Explore the area and hopefully discover the Land bridge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sir John</div><div class="date">May 15, 2003, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How do we know that there even is a landbridge?</div></div><hr />

I'm talking about that bottle neck, you know the one which his 1 land tile with 1 water tile on each side, making it a strangle point, and a canal for naval forces.  1 city on that tile could prove very valuable.</div></div><hr />
