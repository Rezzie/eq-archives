Sometimes I can get around it by changing my build from settler to granary, wait a turn, then switch back, but it only worked once.   This happened @ 1700 bc in the GOTM 3.  and happend at capital in another city.  I went at least 30 turns I even think my population reduced as if it did build the settler but none was actually produced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use this a lot. The settler will not be built because as long as the city has a surplus food supply, it will wait for the city to grow before producing it.<br />
<br />
In this case, all you have to do it reduce the citie's food excess to zero.<br />

Hope I helped,<br />
