<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As we all know, there is a Maximum number of characters one can have. This number is Two. Having two characters is fine for some storylines, but not for others. Having many characters, like five, is sometimes needed to make a succesful story line. <br />
<br />
I am standing (really sitting...) here today asking for a repeal of the Character Maximum. I feel it is an unfair bar which can stall creativity. If we had whatever amount we needed, that would be fair. I, as Game Manager, would step in if someone were creating characters for money (besides, the amount of income goes to the player)<br />
<br />
I am using for my defense, as always, the Sir SaaMs. I call upon &quot;The Birth Of Cool&quot; (http://forums.civfanatics.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=49043&amp;perpage=20&amp;display=&amp;pagenumber=1) as my defense. This... odd... story line could have never occured with just two characters. It took several to get the job done.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Im just asking for more characters.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Civanator</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">HHmmmm...... you have a point there stuck... but then people can exploit the system, like have 1 character do all the work, on character do all the thinking..... removing the maximum will be a good thing if people play properly. You have my support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CivGeneral</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2003, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would agree with letting us have more Characters. Though I am confortable of having a Max of 4 Characters. In the last DG RPG, I have used 4 Characters (Mara Jade, Myself and there freinds Dr. Ed and Dr Conrad)<br />
<br />
Right now, I am having Mara Jade and Myself be Military Commanders and my other 2 Characters as Scientists from another Movie (Dr. Ed and Dr. Conrad came from the move, The Core)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 03:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would think that you can have as many &quot;story&quot; characters as you want as long as all the RPG checks were sent to the main player.<br />
<br />
I am still trying to get a grasp of how the new RPG works, so let me read up on this a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 04:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Im glad to see that there is support for this. Also- @DZ- you need to register your characters.<br />
Well, Ill let this run for another day. Then I'll poll it (first a populous poll and there the Managers will vote Yay or Nay on it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree.  Personally, I use only one major character (self-named), but for the sake of storylines having multiple might be better.  Four is a good number.  In most of my stories, anybody besides my main character or somebody else's is just a random drone (who usually dies, but that's just me... ;) ).  So if you want to make the maximum 4, with only one getting paid.... sounds good to me. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stuck_as_a_Mac</div><div class="date">Jun 30, 2003, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll be doing a few polls. The first is Yes/No over whether or not to do it. The second will be how many characters should we have. The third will be a Managerial Poll for final confermation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">disorganizer</div><div class="date">Jul 01, 2003, 05:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well, maybe i got an idea for how you can still limit it:<br />
<br />
2 characters is the standard maximum for all players. those are the 2 permanent characters of the player.<br />
<br />
every player can have as many additional &quot;temporary&quot; characters as he wishes, but he/she MUST get approval by the rpg manager himself for them.<br />
<br />
to get approoval, the player must pm a request for those characters with their names, stats and their purpose (maybe a short outline of the planned storyline or other purposes) to the rpg manager. he will then receive official approval in the rpg management thread.<br />
<br />
those temporary characters should be removed during the game. the main roleplaying of the player should take place within his 2 permanent characters.<br />
<br />
a maximum of 10 temporary characters is set.<br />
<br />
the rpg manager can decide at any time to &quot;kill off&quot; any temporary character in the rpg if he/she thinks they are not used for roleplay or are used to &quot;cheat&quot;.<br />
<br />
a player can &quot;kill off&quot; any of his permanent or temporary characters at any time. but he must roleplay that!<br />
<br />
it must clearly be stated in the character registry post of the player which characters are permanent and which are temporary.<br />
<br />
any permanent character may be changed into a temporary character at any time. same for temporary characters. a &quot;status change&quot; of a character may only apply ONE TIME during each term. for all of a player's characters.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
one addition maybe: we should allow people to let their characters have children though not forcing them to. the children could then be the temporary characters for example and later during the rpg become the permanent characters (for example if the player lets one of his permanent characters die).<br />
example:<br />
lucentio and victoria could have a child, called vendetto. as lucentio and victoria are my permanent characters atm, vendetto would be a temporary character. after some tc's, i could kill off lucentio during a roleplay and let vendetto be a permanent character...</div></div><hr />
