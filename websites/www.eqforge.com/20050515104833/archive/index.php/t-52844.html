<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">May 08, 2003, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A recent poll result indicated that a vast majority of people favor building a granary in Noshuret sometime soon.  Do we want to build this before producing any more settlers, or just to increase the growth rate when we stop building settlers in Noshuret.  Currently, my instructions are to complete 2 or 3 settlers in the capital before switching it to other production.  One settler is complete.</div></div><hr />

Granary, settler, Barracks, warrior, spearmen, settler, warrior, warrior, warrior, settler, warrior, warrior, warrior, settler, warrior, settler.</div></div><hr />

weve got a while till we hit 3 again. Sure, Chieftess's Creek may be a quick grower. Perhaps:<br />
Warrior, Granary, Settler</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">May 08, 2003, 07:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would recommend warrior, granary, settler, warrior, barracks, settler to get the next two settlers out. After that any other production is in order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 08, 2003, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I changed my city name to Gorina. Anyway, since there's barbs, I'd probably go with 1 warrior, then the granary and settlers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">May 08, 2003, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we need to delay the Granary and get the Warriors out in full force to reclaim our lands from these savages.  Besides using them for offense, we can station them on mountains to eliminate &quot;fog of war.&quot;  This could spare us future surprise threats from barbs.<br />
<br />
As far as a granary goes, I would like to try another tactic. Put Granaries in our more fertile cities and use those cities to produce workers to join less fertile cities like Noshuret.  This way we may not have to build a Granary in every city.<br />
<br />
However, in Noshuret's case, a Granary may be necessary.  But let's kick some barbarian butt first!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cpt Kaos</div><div class="date">May 08, 2003, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with DZ on this one. We need to protect the within reach until we can get a settler factory going on full production.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amirsan</div><div class="date">May 09, 2003, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont realy think we need a granary in the first place. WE are the Romans, build what we can use to our advantage, warriors(warriors&gt;Legionary). With the plenty of time we have from size 1 to size 2 we can use building lots of warriors. We should build Granary when we realy need it. When we begin pre-building is then when we should start the Granary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">alamo</div><div class="date">May 09, 2003, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I concurr.  There isn't enought time for a granary.  We need  more warriors and another worker.<br />
<br />
The settler must make a fertile city, and that can be the settler factory.  I don't know where the settler is right now, but there is a warrior to escort.<br />
<br />
How about a palace jump?  The 2cnd city will be far away and not as productive as we need.  We could disband nosuret w/a settler before a third city is founded, and just plop it back down again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chieftess</div><div class="date">May 09, 2003, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it might be too soon for a palace jump. Maybe when we're a bit more established and know of our surroundings. We don't want to plop the capital right next to a misaligned AI city.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">May 09, 2003, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the build queue in Noshuret should also depend on the situation in Gorina. If we suddenly see colored borders, Barb camps or non-Fanaticum units, we cannot exploit it's role as a settler/worker factory easily. Then Nosh has to play a part in early settlers and less military/explorers first. If on the other hand it's situation is excellent, we can use it for that. Nosh will be able to build warriors and granary before it's settler. <br />
So: I either prefer in Nosh: warrior granary settler, or warrior warrior granary settler.</div></div><hr />
