<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy76</div><div class="date">Nov 01, 2002, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have heard of these but have not run into one since it has been over 2 years since I purchased a CD, until now. I went out and figured I would support my favorite artist, Eminem, and purchased the 8 Mile soundtrack for 13.99 USD, which is a good deal when you consider I bought it from the store FYE (For Your Entertainment). I stuck it in my computer and was semi-suprised to find out it would not play. I was only semi-suprised because I have heard of CDs that will not play in computer CD-ROM drives. That is really disappointing since I only listen to music through my computer....I decided to take back the CD and get my money back. Unfortunately FYE does not give cash back on open CDs; however, the manager was able to give me store credit, so I ended up buying a DVD player (uh, spent a little extra money, still trying to figure out a way to justify it to the old lady! I think I will use the fact that I canceled cable, which is 85 bucks a month, and guess what, the DVD-player cost 80 bucks! but there is a 30 USD mail in rebate so I purchased her favorite DVD also. hehehe).<br />
<br />
     Ok, now that I have that long intro out of the way here comes the question: does anyone know of a website that tracks CDs that are unplayable in CD-ROM drives? The manager told me that there are CDs that come out now with notice that they DO play in CD-ROM drives.<br />
<br />
  Also, I am thinking of writing a letter to Eminem and the record companies that are involved with that CD to let them know that they have lost out on my money. After not buying CDs for 2 years I go out and try to support the artist just to be spat on by him and the record company. I hope this making of CDs that don't work in CD-ROM drives gets resolved quickly; I bet M$ is going to be pissed since they are coming out with and entertainment center PC type machine. It would be embarrasing for the M$ machine to not be able to play certain CDs.....</div></div><hr />
