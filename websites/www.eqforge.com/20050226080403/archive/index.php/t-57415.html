<br />
(1) FJ and BP still need some stuff (caravans and improvements). These cities and especially BBF should be considered high priority cities.<br />
(2) Superstorms is about to reach size 3, it would be extremely useful if this city could reach size 8 or so. Pay attention to the nearby coal.<br />
(3) This is not a domestic issue but the MoDA still recommends stealing chivalry.<br />
(4) Explore the southern coast of Hell.<br />
(5) In Coresux, cities near Dou and RF should be considered high priority cities together with VM<br />
(6) LC has food problems. Send more engineers over there, a city like e.g. RF has adequate food surplus at the moment. Also RB engineers in PB ASAP (see 1440 AD).<br />
(7) Watch the supply/demand in Dou every turn. If it becomes possible to build commodity caravans there then RB, RB, RB !<br />
(8) Start irrigating jungles in Coresux once something easier like irrigation is finished in important spots.<br />
(9) After 1460 AD increase luxuries as needed to keep celebrating.<br />
(10) Found a city on Coresux' northern tip within 10 turns.<br />
<br />
The highest priority turn by turn things to do (please see build queues and polls for additional details):<br />
<br />
1420 AD<br />
Set tax=70%, lux=20%, sci=10%<br />
Switch to engineers in RF and IPRB them<br />
Feel free to RB stuff but be careful to leave enough cash to finish the wonders next turn.<br />
Recommendation: Steal chivalry from the Greeks<br />
There is a sleeping diplomat in N Barbaria. Wake him up and finish exploring N Barbaria.<br />
<br />
1440 AD<br />
Neu builds caravan, start Bach. Dump all caravans in/near Neu into the wonder (exception: caravans from cities with less than 3 trade routes) and use cash to RB Bach if not enough caravans to finish the wonder.<br />
<br />
RF build engineer, start Magellan. Dump all nearby caravans into Magellan (exception: caravans from cities with less than 3 trade routes), use cash to RB it since not enough caravans are nearby to finish it.<br />
<br />
Now that the wonders have been bought it is safe to spend cash rush buying. Engineer in PB is a very high priority.<br />
<br />
1460 AD<br />
Neu builds Bach, RF builds Magellan<br />
Set lux=40%, tax=50%, sco=10%, start celebrations. Maximize trade in all size 3+ cities by working ocean squares, specials etc. without making shields drop to 0.<br />
<br />
If nothing unexpected happens it should be safe to play roughly 8 turns (maybe 10 if the celebrations do not start running out of steam).</div></div><hr />
