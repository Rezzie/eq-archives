<br />
Here's what it said:<br />
I have determined that you are using some sort of ad-blocking software.<br />
<br />
Please understand that I'm able to provide this content for free because of the banner ads and if you choose to block them I will eventually have to close the site. When you decide to take the right to try and browse the site without ads I think I have the right to deny access to the site.</div></div><hr />

I mean it doesn't know the ads aren't being seen. Plus, TF pretty much suggests ad blocking software and he relies on ads to keep the site up on the net.</div></div><hr />

People want to advertise, but many people son't want to see it.... whether its on our roads, in our maiboxes, in out E-Mail inbox, or on our web surfing pages!<br />
<br />
I've seen that  type of notice before, and just ignor those websites....  :hammer:<br />

<br />
Actually don't. That's not acceptable. But dream about it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2002, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I support his choice in doing that...but I too would think it sucks. I ignore banners so I don't use a program like you, but I would be really mad if someone restricted me from their site because of using an no popup program. Actually, I would probably run into a problem accessing that site since I utilize IE6's cookie blocking feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TedG</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2002, 01:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ignore banners, too. It's the darn pop-ups that annoy me. Since I installed ZoneAlarm, I've had NO POPUPS and it's wonderful.:) :D :cool: :goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 29, 2002, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At  the moment, I'm still using At Guard 3.22, from about 3 years ago.  It controls popups, javascript, active-X, and allows customization by site/url/directory on a site, etc.  It also does more.  But I suspect it will start to become dated as people make new sites that can sneak thru  :(.</div></div><hr />
