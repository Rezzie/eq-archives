<br />
Win 2K is superior to XP in most what that matter, and MS's incremental upgrades to keep the cash coming in are really growing stale.  But XP is a testbed for some really really nefarious things MS plans to do to consumers (but not large businesses)... namely, logging and tracking most things you do on your personal machine.  XP currently only spies on your system configurationand reports dutifully to MS when you connect to the Internet... try swapping your network card and/or changing system components and enjoy the fact your system no longer works until you speak to MS on the phone and get their permission to continue to use your machine.  Quite evil.<br />

I also use various Linux OSs, but don't have any installed right now, due to space.<br />

I've had no real problems with it - I turned off the kiddish GUI and the error reporting, and I've changed hardware without having anything being deactivated by MS. Maybe that's because I'm using the version that Dell sent me, rather than one from the store. I've only used Win2K at school, but it's also really good. I think XP is almost the same as 2K but maybe better in some aspects. It's definitely better than any Windows 9x versions for stability and speed. XP and 2K are basically the only OSes MS has made that aren't crap.</div></div><hr />

XP all the way. I have tried Linux and BSD....I don't see how they are better. Linux aggrevates me so much because it is supposed to be the ultimate OS, according to the people that use it, but even when they use it I only see problems. Maybe I will open a thread about my Linux problems. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
- I use a Dell laptop and the Dell copy of XP doesn't need activation.<br />
- &quot;Clear Type&quot; that comes with XP is a must for a LCD screen. (In my opinion).<br />
- You can turn off the kiddish GUI.<br />
<br />
And a question; both 2000 and XP are built on NT kernel. How can 2000 be better than XP?   <br />
<br />
I also would like to add I tried several Linux distros; (Mandrake, Redhat and Suse) but I couldn't make things go all right. (But I'll give a try to the latest Suse 8.0).</div></div><hr />

what does gui do? should i turn it off? As its name suggests, GUI is an interface. Mainly, everything that displays pictures and allows you to click around is said to have a GUI. <br />
<br />
Thus, the Windows' GUI is a core part of Windows, you cannot turn it off.<br />
DOS itself comes with no GUI, but Win 3.1 is a GUI for dos.<br />
You can work in Linux with no GUI, but all distributions (that I know of) come with one (the X-Window system).<br />
<br />
When people say they want to 'turn off the cartoon GUI', they (I think, I haven't used XP) mean reverting to the old GUI.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps! :)</div></div><hr />

If you haven't used XP, then don't say all Windows versions suck, because XP is one version of Windows that doesn't suck. You can choose not to use the stupid default GUI and go back to the classic Windows interface. It's not UNIX-based, but I don't know much about that. It is incredibly stable so a blue screen of death is rarely, if ever, seen when using XP. And I don'w know what you mean by &quot;spyware.&quot; There is no spyware in XP. It simply checks hardware configurations to make sure you're not running the same copy of XP on two different computers, which you won't be affected by if you're legally using XP on one machine according to the license. It is possible (but not known for sure) that error reporting can send personal information to MS, instead of just information about an error. But you can turn that off, anyway. Any other spyware would be from programs you've installed, not the OS itself. It is unfortunate that stuff like that defaults to &quot;turned on&quot; but MS isn't the only company that does stuff like that (Real Networks, for example).</div></div><hr />

Right-click on My Computer, choose properties, then click the Advanced tab. Down at the bottom, you should see &quot;Error Reporting.&quot; That's where you can disable it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It can, but at the moment MS says it does not.  The real reason (I ahve friends at MS) is that MS is over 2 years behind schedule in developing the infrastructure to &quot;reliably&quot; control the PCs of home users (and small businesses) in real time without regard to what the user wants.<br />
<br />
The massive database is pretty screwed up and the delays in approving your mouse clicks (via the internet) and reporting to Big Brother MS lag too much.  You have to know Bill's history.  He feels he should have the final say in all MS software that is run on your computer, not you.  The next releases of Office, and supposedly the OS will not be &quot;complete&quot;.... that is, the final keys or missing program segmetns will be downloaded upon each MS-authorized mouse click activating MS programs.  Supposedly, this will stamp out all pirating, even in China, where Bill is particularly pissed.  <br />
<br />
Win XP is an incremental step form Win2K, not much more.  It is designed to generate sales as people replace their always-defective Win95, 98, ME.  You all have been such cooperative beta testors, LOL.<br />
<br />
When most people are on XP (or at least W2K), the &quot;step up&quot; to the MS Big Brother OS will be facilitated.  And so many of you will go like sheep to the slaughter.   There is real evil festering at MS, that much is certain.  I hope the backlash is so strong that it destroys much of their despicable empire.....<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, XP has over 6,000 known defects and bugs in it.  There are a lot of technical issues with it, but if it is working OK on your machine, then great!<br />
<br />
W2K is as far as I'll go.... unless I &quot;obtain&quot; the non-Big Brother version of XP that is meant only for certain special people and certain corporate customers  ;).</div></div><hr />

If MS goes to drastic measures such as these, there will definitely be a backlash. Everyone will flock to Mac/Linux and quit using MS software alltogether. Well, at least MS won't have to worry about piracy anymore!:lol: They'll cause nobody to want to use their software and therefore no need to pirate it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but you can bet that a &quot;less geeky&quot; version of Linux would appear if they saw that they were gonna have the new majority of users (and you'd also see a lot more software developed for Linux). Besides, it won't hurt people to learn a little more about computers, will it?:D<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd like to see MS die and another OS become popular, but right now PC users are almost forced to use MS because of the availability of software. It would be nice if software companies developed for Linux to help make it a good alternative to MS (that's not to say it isn't already, but there still needs to be more software for it, esp. games, before it can really compete with Windows).</div></div><hr />

mac sucks i use windows me but i want xp Thanks for your contribution. :rolleyes: <br />

As for flocking to Linux....I don't think so. If I, a hardened veteran of loading computers, has a problem loading Mandrake Linux and using it effectively. I doubt that Joe Average User will be able. 'Besides, it won't hurt people to learn a little more about computers, will it?' No, but they won't. It is like pulling teeth to explain stuff to my wife and she is pretty good at using computers compared to the average person.<br />
<br />
If there is going to be any flocking it will be to Macs....they have come down in price and have better gaming support than Linux....barely. :D Now don't take this as an endorsement of Mac from me, it is not. ;)<br />
<br />
And starlifter, I have a legal copy of Windows XP (finally) but there are ways of obtaining the Corporate version of it also. ;) Also, there will always be a 'Corporate' version of MS products, or whatever they call it, as businesses don't want to have to check in with every PC they install the software on. That isn't safe for their network and product activation requires too much of their time. There will always be a version of MS products that MS can't keep track of.</div></div><hr />

The downside to that is the need to buy new (and sometimes expensive) hardware. That was why I mentioned Linux because, assuming MS &quot;committed suicide,&quot; not everyone with a PC would be able to run out and buy a new computer (Mac) so Linux would be the only cheaper alternative, even though it would be a hassle. Now if Apple made a version of their OS for PC...:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think about it, if Wal-Mart is selling computers with it pre-loaded for such a low cost, the average user will be more likely to use it.  You don't get more Jo-Average than a Wal-Mart customer.<br />
<br />
It could be the steping stone needed.  Hopefully.  I hate MS as much as you all do.</div></div><hr />

Good point to TedG also on the expense...but I am going from the assumption that people will use their old MS systems until they buy a new one.....how many Joe Users load their own OS? I would say not many...Joe User will go out and buy a new computer and will look at the easy of the iMac and grab that. they can be had for $1,200K now, very PC-like price<br />
<br />
...I can't even get a friend to update his sound card drivers because he is afraid of having problems (the sound doesn't work for one of his new games, NWN, but it does for others - So he blames Bioware the maker of NWN....not the people that put a sound card in his system that isn't even officially supported by XP Home :rolleyes:) so I can't see Joe User updating his OS. :D</div></div><hr />

I've heard about that Lindows thing but I don't know much about it. Maybe it will do well against MS...:)<br />
<br />

Yeah, that would work. MS would try to get people to upgrade to a newer Windows version by &quot;no longer supporting&quot; their older OSes, but that would probably just cause more and more people to ditch MS alltogether.<br />
<br />

I was a Joe User once, struggling with Windows 95. I did have some help, but I did a lot of it on my own, which helped me learn a lot more.:)<br />

Now if they just started becoming more &quot;gaming computers,&quot; Macs would look all the more enticing...:)<br />

I know what you mean.:) I've had the same type of experience before, with a friend who would not (and still will not) delete 100s of MB of crap from his temp folder because of a MS warning that it might damage his computer.:mad: That's not the only time I've dealt with Joe Users, but it goes to show that there are a lot of Joe Users out there.:)</div></div><hr />
