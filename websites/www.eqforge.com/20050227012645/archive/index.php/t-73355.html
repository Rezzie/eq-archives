After doing that I started building city improvements that help happiness (Courthouses, Marketplaces, etc) while slowly adding to the Spaceship.  Many Structurals have been added 2 or 3 components and 1 module.<br />
<br />
Right now, we are getting the peace bonus plus the future tech points plus working towards larger Spaceship points.<br />
<br />
I have disbanded 95% of our military units since they are no longer needed.  3 stealth fighters are sitting near the last Chinese city, but hopefully we will never have to use them and lose the peace bonus.<br />
<br />
Some of the cities are just now getting done with their Improvements and are thus starting to produce freight again.<br />
<br />
Our current Science production is just short of getting us one tech per turn.  Now that we can deliver some freight we should be able to get back to one per turn (or more?).<br />

Funxus is up.</div></div><hr />

Please convince us.:)  There's no direct need for them, no enemy except the chinese, who are under control anyway. Even if we would need them, the extra 20s for a rifleman probably would be worth it, so we wouldn't have to drop out of Demo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was from a few turns back.  Since then they have helped cities build city improvemtns to make them happier. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Jan 01, 2004, 08:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We have many units.  Some units attack some cities, other units attack other cities, we capture said cities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HiDeWaY</div><div class="date">Jan 01, 2004, 09:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">anyway, this dont seem democratic, u say what will happen and we read it, this sux!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Jan 01, 2004, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The basis of the game has changed quite a bit since our level of participants has dropped to nil.  But, the normal process is for the people to give their input and then the President plays the turns and reports on what happened.  That's what you see above.<br />
<br />
If you have an idea you want to see happen, post about it. However, since it is so near the end of the game, I'm not sure what other options there are in the game.</div></div><hr />

I thouhgt we were past the point where they could show up as sea Barbs and they wasn't any real open terrain that we didn't have troops near that they should have shown up at?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Jan 05, 2004, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, they did show up - 4 times!! One group had 24 units! They showed up in the open spaces close to 'China'. Not a lot of defence there!! But don't worry - Jayne the Barb-Slayer sorted them out! :D</div></div><hr />
