<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willemvanoranje</div><div class="date">Mar 24, 2001, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I started on a new project a week ago. Its 'workname' is Star Trek: Delta War'. Any name suggestions are very welcome.<br />
<br />
The scenario is going to be about the war between the Borg and Species 8472. I already have a few units, but not enough. I still need:<br />
<br />
- Borg Cube (small, large)<br />
- Borg Sphere (small)<br />
- Borg Queen Vessel<br />
- Hirogen ships<br />
- Kazon ship (large)<br />
<br />
It is going to be meant to play as the Borg. You'll start in the DQ, and you have to assimilate a few species (kazon, Hirogen). After a few turns, you'll discover 'Interdimensional Travel', and a dimension gate will open, opening a gateway to the universe of Species 8472. <br />
<br />
If you have any ideas or suggestions, especially for units, or do you have pictures of Borg or other race vessels that could be turned into units, please send it to me at KEVINKLOP@HOTMAIL.COM<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<br />
Besides the normal cube, there is also the tactical cube which has an armored exterior. These were first seen in the fight against 8472.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the B-5 translations. That was really fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ST: Delta War, sounds like a great name! Did you get the Beta ver. that I sent you? It has some units in it too...<br />

John, I received it, but it doesn't unzip correctly. I sent you a mail back. Could you send it again, please? Not the sounds, my account (and my father) can't handle it.<br />

However, the music... It'll take fifteen minutes, and my father won't be happy about it. I'll try to send it to you, but that'll be tonight (for me after 7 pm, GMT+1). It's more than 3 Mb.<br />

I decided to use the 'same unit different strength' thing. You can research 'upgrades' for your units, and they'll be stronger.<br />
<br />
That's what I'm using in my ST scenario.  You have the Galaxy Class ships but you have Photon/Quantum/Micro-Quantum torpedos or a Tri-Cobalt device (or a mix) that you can outfit it with.<br />
<br />
There will also be Cubes and Transwarp Cubes....each being stronger and faster than the last!!!<br />
<br />
It's pretty cool....but my graphics ability sucks and I'm having trouble making the units look different from each other.  (Plus they don't look the best yet anyway.....)<br />
<br />
But that's an excellent idea.<br />

I think I'll have the scenario done by the end of May, but then, things can happen, right?<br />
