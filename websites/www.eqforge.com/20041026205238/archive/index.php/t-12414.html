<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Dec 18, 2001, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems Civ3 has slightly affected the TSG-1 succession game. No one has played for the Greeks since I played one month ago and no one has downloaded the game.<br />
<br />
At that time it was obvious that the glorious communistic state of Greece was far ahead of the puny Brits :D. It had a far greater population, especially since North America was under total control while the Brits coexisted there with the fairly big Aztec and Zulu civs. In contrast, the Greeks had bigger success there. Upon seeing the great Greek military exhibitions the Aztecs and Zulus greatly admired the wonderful sight they saw and respectfully asked if they could join the glorious Greek civilization. This was conditionally approved and they've been an integral part of communistic Greece ever since.<br />
<br />
Also the biggest Greek cities were far bigger than the biggest British ones. In fact the British population and the size of their cities was no match for the Greeks until several decades had passed.<br />
<br />
A foothold had been established on some Asian islands and Greek diplomats had convinced the Chinese that it was in the interest of the entire civilized world for them to give the Greeks all of their scientific knowledge. All of this was achieved under the glorious leadership of various great leaders.<br />
<br />
The above should make it obvious that advancing Greek interests by taking control of their empire should be interesting, far more interesting than attempting to lead the puny Brits :D.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I intend to do take control of the Greeks myself and finish this game since I'm less busy now than in the past several weeks and have again time to play civ 2/3. That is, unless someone shows up with genuine interest to take over. I'd post a log from time to time (every 10-20 turns). This is supposed to be a succession game so this would become a succession of viking governments ;). This would sort of finish the TSG-1 without allowing a British monoploy on things :D. Due to Civ3 this also might be the last Civ2 succession game here ?<br />
<br />
Actually someone posted an interesting idea (probably in the British thread) of a succession game at a more difficult level than deity (more unhappiness and *lots* of barbarians) by hacking some game files. This would be interesting although it would probably rule out other players than expert deity players.</div></div><hr />
