We have a good relationship with everyone except the Greeks. They are also at war with the receptive French and enthusiastic Aztecs. Maybe they will offer an alliance? I would suggest the Aztecs as they are more technologically advanced that the French and closer to the Greeks. Also, as we share an island with them, it may buy us time to get well establish before the inevitable hostilities.<br />

Before we ally with someone, we should know how it'll affect our reputation if we break it or not declare war when they ask us to. If it affects our reputation much we might not have the option of breaking it whenever we want, because we need to keep a spotless rep. It'd be nice though if we could get some help.:)</div></div><hr />

I don't think it'll be too hard to encourage an AI to break an alliance - just keep demanding stuff until they get fed up with us! :mischief:</div></div><hr />
