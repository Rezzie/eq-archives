<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chukchi_Husky</div><div class="date">Oct 05, 2004, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Name:<br />
Wolf Nation of Lyconia (a race of biped intelligent wolves)<br />
<br />
Government:<br />
The hierarchy of the wolves is similar to feudalism, with more freedom for the population.<br />
The alpha pair heads the hierarchy of the wolves.  The alpha pair consists of a male and a female.  The alpha pair holds a lifetime position, and after their death, the population vote for the next pair.<br />
Most of the time, the population would remain loyal to the alpha pair, but if the pair are no good at ruling the domain, they can be overthrown and replaced with a newly elected pair.<br />
Below the alpha pair are the beta pairs.  The beta pairs each hold a domain granted to them by alpha pair once they swear an oath of fealty to the alpha pair.<br />
Most of the population consists of the subordinates, which also include the advisors of the alpha pair, as the do not hold any land.  The lowest class of wolf includes the omegas and the lone wolves.<br />
<br />
Specialities:<br />
The wolves are skilled at scouting because of their enhanced senses.  The forests give the wolves their life, because the forests provide the wolves with food, shelter and protection.  The wolves can also live in colder regions because of their fur.<br />
<br />
Advantages:<br />
The wolves have many superior abilities to the other races.  These abilities include:<br />
Excellent nighttime vision, incredibly good hearing (can hear sounds up to six miles away, including some high-pitched sounds)<br />
They walk on their toes instead of their feet, making them faster (they can also walk on all fours)<br />
Excellent sense of smell (about 100 times better than a humans, the ability to smell prey before it can see it and sense the presence of an animal three days after it's gone).<br />
The wolves have extreme loyalty, which can benefit any of their allies.<br />
Wolf vocalisation, usually done to create the illusion on more wolves, and good hearing has enabled the wolves to be very musical.<br />
<br />
Disadvantages:<br />
Early encounters with the wolves and their hunting techniques have given the other races a stereotype of the wolves being unstoppable bloodthirsty beasts.  The wolves’ loyalty can also lead to a disadvantage.  This can lead the enemy easily trick the wolves into befriending them, and then turning their backs on the wolves in the last moment.<br />
Stereotyping has made the other races hunt the wolves to extinction.  This has led the wolves to fear humans.<br />
The wolves are a territorial race.   They will defend their territory from all invaders.<br />
The wolves’ fur, and their inability to sweat, makes them vulnerable to heat.  To cool down, the wolves hang their tongues out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PlutonianEmpire</div><div class="date">Oct 05, 2004, 02:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nation: The Plutonian Empire<br />
<br />
Gov't: Plutonianism, a constitutional, semi-absolute monarchy. The populace can vote, but not for new leaders. If the leader dies, the throne goes to the heir. If there is no heir, then the populace may vote for a new leader. The leader always has the final say in votes.<br />
<br />
Specialties: Nukes; benevolent domination of the universe; live in extremely high latitudes (in very cold climates and on very cold planets); terraforming; space exploration; weather control; DOUGHNUTS :drool: ; and wanton nuclear annihilation of enemy (if any) nations (if we consider you our enemy, you're doomed :D ).<br />
<br />
Advantages: We are very mysterious (we have a tendency to pop up right out of nowhere, just when everyone thinks that the entire world/galaxy/multiverse has been explored); Unlimited counter-espionage abilities (we hate embassies. We don't build embassies in your land, so don't build one in ours); may reincarnate after being defeated (we love Mother nature as she loves us); very high reproduction rate (abortion is banned outright, and we are sex addicts. Put those together, and it counts as TWO granaries in every city); pro-life philosophies, putting life, both physical life and the quality of life, renders unhappiness non-existant in the Empire; and finally, our nukes are equiped with Explosive Ice technology, technically turning them into &quot;Nuclear Ice Bombs&quot; (we just LOVE ice and snow. A 20 kiloton ice-nuke detonation is strong enough to trigger Tornadoes a hundred miles away.)<br />
<br />
Disadvantages: Our hatred of abortion leaves us susceptible to occasional terrorist attacks sanctioned by other governments; wanton use of nukes often leaves the planet devastated.<br />
<br />
Typical citizen:<br />
Species: Human, except with a visibly ridged spine. (Kinda like Klingons, but our skin tones are much lighter)<br />
Male: 5'4&quot;; 110 lbs; white.<br />
Female: 5'3&quot;; 130 lbs; voluptuous/well-endowed; white, asian.</div></div><hr />

Government: Dictatorship led by Jedi mole Joeb Wan Kenobi<br />
Specialities:Exellent diggers,subterranian builders and have night vision<br />
Disadvantages:Slow runners<br />
Resources:Lots of ancient mole books full of useful infomation and alot of spare blood if any moles are injured and cut badly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Specialist290</div><div class="date">Oct 05, 2004, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some stuff has changed. I'll ist some general changes here. More specific details will come in my first story.<br />
<br />
Name: the Specialists<br />
Gov't.: A Governing Council consisting of 290 members, with supreme leadership alternating each year--an Oligarchy like the ancient Roman Senate, as it were<br />
Specialties: Excel in subconscious manipulation of others; like really, really big construction projects; also make superb pizza and milkshakes<br />
Advantages: Difficult to surprise; very perceptive of other's weaknesses, even when the target supposes it have none; more led by logic than emotion (and thus stay calmer in &quot;intense situations&quot; than others); highly inclined to development of military techology; surprisingly creative; skilled seafarers and colonizers (think 16th-19th century England for this one); extremely difficult to fully eliminate<br />
Disadvantages: Paranoid and distrustful of others (though this tendency has mellowed some since the first Post Wars); often lose sight of all else when focusing on a single goal; domestic policy can be a little repressive at times; considered devoid of cultural talent by others (while this may seem contradictory w/ the &quot;surprisingly creative&quot; advantage, it's not--all that creativity just goes into something other than exquisite paintings, magnificent architechture, etc.)<br />
Society: Government is highly male-oriented i.e. no females can become Council members; due to specialization of various fields, regular society is highly stratified, with class distinctions being sharper than in most other nations<br />
Other: Pyromaniacs :D<br />
<br />
Changes: The two most noticeable differences are that the Specialists have become more receptive to the outside world, and that all of the Chosen (the ones who possessed limited psychic tendencies) and the Cultists were wiped out by the asteroid and its after-effects. This has led to some decreased government repression (consideration for Council open to all, as well as some of its &quot;mystique&quot; lost), but the government (along with the nation in general) retains its desire for as much control as possible over the world around it.</div></div><hr />

Morphology: A variety of towels formed by various combinations and structure of thread.<br />
Organization: Individual threads are linked in a neural net which forms the nervous system of the towel.  Each thread handles diffusion of food products, gases, and all other products.  How communication occurs between threads is unknown.<br />
Government: Towelie gives out orders, whenever he is not intoxicated.<br />
Home: Tend to be in other's bathrooms or beaches.</div></div><hr />

It has been 4 days now, 4 days of misery. I have found only one other survivor in this city I once called home, his name was Javid. He was in the airport, we were both going to province 137. He had complained about the long wait and the poor service. It seems like so long ago now, but thatdoesn't matter anymore. Now he is dead, and again I am alone. I could be all that is left of my family, my nation, my species, the thought keeps hauting me but I can not let it stop me. If I survived the wave then surley others have as well. They must have, I must find them, they are out there... somewhere...<br />
Death and sorrow had consumed the world labled Y214-B. The meteor had been merciless, it's wrath had cut down almost all that had been made of this quiet little sphere. Order had descended into chaos, where there was once calm there was now only anarchy. But not all had been lost, there were those whom had been spared. Those few survivors would move on, they would rebuild all they had lost. Rising from the ashes of the old world they would start anew, forever reaching outward into the unknown....<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, the Second Post War is on, let's get this thing in gear!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chukchi_Husky</div><div class="date">Oct 07, 2004, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before the impact:<br />
	After the release of the abducted, the popularity of alpha male Sumner declined dramatically, fuelled by propaganda from an unknown source.  Sumner abdicates, becoming a bassist-vocalist, and calling himself Sting.  Elections soon took place throughout the domain, and the results show that the majority of the population want flamboyant Bulsara for the new alpha male.  <br />
<br />
Soon after Bulsara took the office, gas turbine engines began to appear.  The gas turbine, also known as the jet, allowed the wolves to create a new form of transportation.  A modification of the jet engine created the vector thrust jet engine, designed for flying in the forest cities.  The vector thrust engine allows for the manoeuvrability of a helicopter, including the ability to hover, with the speed and design of a regular jet plane.<br />
<br />
This is the technology used on the Harrier Jump Jet<br />
<br />
Vector aircraft began to appear throughout the domain, and later became the most popular form of transportation available, replacing most forms of land and sea transport.  Helium-filled freighters escorted by vector jet aircraft transport large cargo.  The freighters can also carry vector aircraft.<br />
<br />
This idea was taken from Crimson Skies, except the planes on Crimson Skies used combustion engines<br />
<br />
During a routine mission in the southern ocean, a group of SkyWolf Industries AV-14 &quot;Kestrel&quot; reconnaissance aircraft discover a large object in the sky.  This object, later identified as a meteor, is approximately 3 kilometres in diameter, and its impact would be devastating, causing giant tsunamis to attack all coastal regions.  The scout party returned to alert the new alpha about this discovery, and the alpha declared a state of emergency.  The wolves evacuated to the cities of Spirit City and Aero City.<br />
<br />
After the impact:<br />
The tsunamis hit the nation with great force.  The waves were over 300 metres high, and washed away all of the cities and forests of the Lyconia valley.  The tsunamis also eroded the valley, so that after the waters calmed down, a permanent shallow sea, known as Lyconia Bay, formed where the valley was.  The evacuation called by Bulsara made sure that the casualties caused by the oncoming tsunamis were minimal.  New cities was founded to hold the population, which include Leppard City, led by beta male Willis, Heston, led by beta wolf Page,  and Rider City, led by beta male Morrison.<br />
<br />
The wolves formed a rescue organisation, sending vector aircraft to all parts of Plutonia to help any victims in distress.  The new cities began to fill up with refugees from the other nations, and each nation could form a temporary colony in wolf territory for their citizens.  The wolves also requested the aid of the A-Team, giving each member an advanced SkyWolf Industries AV-35 &quot;Nighthawk&quot; fighter aircraft and to the team a sky freighter.<br />
<br />
Overall, the wolves were one of the least affected nations of the meteor impact, thanks to their quick execution of the evacuation, helped by the vector aircraft.  During this period of time the vector aircraft became popular with other nations, and after the waters calmed, the wolves began exporting their vector aircraft to other nations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PlutonianEmpire</div><div class="date">Oct 07, 2004, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">**The Empire was doing well. They had just learned how to broadcast color television live. The PlutoCon could take one from Pisces Centauri to Nuke Factories in just a few hours, and one plane was made specifically to be the Presidential Jet (think &quot;Air Force One&quot;). The Lyconian government requested that Chukchi Huski remain within the Plutonian Empire. Also for the first time, an intersest in astronomy was developed. A large &quot;telescope&quot; was construced on the tallest of skyscrapers, to minimize atmospheric interference. After a few months, it was revealed that Plutonia (Planet ID: Y214-B) wasn't the only one orbiting the sun, which was given the name &quot;Plutous.&quot; After discussion with the surviving Yuri abductees, it was realized as to why the Yuri called Plutonia &quot;Y214-B:&quot; Plutous was the 214th star they had visited, and Plutonia was second from the sun, hence the ID &quot;Y214-B.&quot; The first planet, the innermost, was Y214-A, and was also the largest, 17 times bigger than Plutonia.<br />
<br />
**Unfortunately, it would be a while before astronomy could continue...**<br />
<br />
**Joey was piloting his military plutocon over the ocean when he spotted some Lyconian vector aircraft. They seemed lost, so Joey reduced his speed to below supersonic, and went down to help. After a few minutes of discussion, it was learned that they were supposed to be patrolling Towelite territory, but their compasses were wrong, so Joey offered to help, and the wolves accepted. Upon approaching the southern tip, it came. There was a light in the sky, and the pilots looked up. They saw a fast moving point of light. The Towelites below saw it too. Before they knew it, the point of light became a bright streak. On the ground below, a faint hissing could be heard, and that was from a few pieces of rock flying ahead of the asteroid as they entered the atmosphere. A loud explosion was heard as the big asteroid entered the atmosphere. The explosion quickly evolved into a loud shriek, like a landing jet plane on Earth. The asteroid headed straight south, landing in the ocean 750 miles due south of the southern-most tip of towelite territory 5 minutes later.**<br />
<br />
Joey: Aw, jeez!<br />
<br />
**Joey tried to radio his homeland, but there was static (because of the ionization caused by the large meteor). The wolf pilots said they got through okay. They also said that they could find their way back by following the coastline and thanked Joey for his help. Joey said his welcoming, and they parted ways. Joey throttled up and increased altitude. Upon reaching 72,800 feet, he radioed again and got through. Joey warned about the meteor, and potential devastating effects.**<br />
<br />
Reporter: Good evening. This is Plutonian Imperial News and I'm Pamela Rogers. We interrupt your regular programing to bring you breaking news. We have just learned a large meteor has crashed into the planet. Repeat: a large meteor has crashed into Plutonia. The president has ordered the entire poplulation to either go to the top of the towers, or board the PlutoCons. That is all. We here at PIN will now evacuate the headquarters. We wish everyone in the Plutonian Empire, and everyone on Plutonia, good luck, and blessings from Great Mother. Good night.<br />
<br />
**With that, skyscraper-tops suddenly overcrowded. Tempers flared (which normally never happens in Imperial society), some jumped off the roofs, and all sorts of chaos followed. The president and his family evacuated onto the presidential plutocon, and wanted all astronomical records with him, for some reason.<br />
<br />
**Just before sundown, the wave came. In deep sea, it was about 100 meters tall. But as it approached coastlines, wave heights exceeded 500 meters and more. Scorpi Centauri was struck first. Despite the strict building codes, the water force was simply too much for even 2-mile high steel skyscrapers to withstand.<br />
<br />
**The wind, pushed by the onrushing waves, slammed into the buildings, smashing windows. Shattered glass flew everywhere. The waves rushed inland, pushing against the steel. Metal could be heard groaning. Once again, skyscrapers fell. Pisces Centauri was next in line. Skyscrapers there, too, fell. Eventually, the wave reached other parts of the world. Because there was no ice at the south pole, due to global warming, to stop the waves, the entire planet was affected.<br />
<br />
**The President saw the destruction of Pisces Centauri first-hand, from 5 miles up, in the Plutocon. Eugene realized, that on the plus side, this was a great chance to start anew, for the loss of virtually every factory, CO2 production would be virtually gone. Unfortunately, the loss of billions of trees would make it difficult for temps to return to post-eruption levels.**<br />
<br />
Pilot: Where to, Mr. President?<br />
<br />
*Silence*<br />
<br />
Pilot: Mr. President?<br />
<br />
First Lady/Vice President Amy [in a somber tone of voice]: Volcano City, please.<br />
<br />
**PlutoCon turned right. Eugene was looking out the left window, so the horizon dropped out of view. The wine of PlutoCon's engines could be heard, as the plane accelerated and climbed to 72,800 feet. A few hours later, they arrived in a devastated Volcano City.<br />
<br />
**Months passed. Volcano City was made the temporary capital. The waters receded. The final casualty count (for the Empire): 35,765,193,546 killed, 104,533 surviving, mostly because they chose to fly in the PlutoCons, but some on the ground survived through sheer luck. Someone suggested that the sun could be used as an alternate power source, and everyone agreed. Amazingly, no one lost their *ahem* libedo, so population began to increase again, but the temporary lack of food, especially fish and wheat, which is used for doughnuts, inhibited some of the growth. (Some would argue that the waves would scatter fish all over the world, but the carcasses would spoil after just a few days, which would explain the lack of some good fish.) The climate also began to cool, but it will still take decades to return to pre-Great Warming levels.**</div></div><hr />

If you just want to read the story, or are pressed for time, you don't have to look.<br />
<br />
PRE-CATACLYSM<br />
Or, I Like Throwing Around Big Words<br />
<br />
It was an age of progress. After their first failed assault against the Perfection Collective (caused mainly by the sudden effects of hallucinogenic drugs as well as by equipment failures in the cruise missiles), the Specialists made peace, though to do so was usually against their nature. They stepped up their technological research, focusing mainly on applications for plastisteel besides the usual uses.<br />
<br />
One of their achievements in this field was a small submersible vessel made of plastisteel. It was during field tests of the prototype that a very strange property of the material was discovered: Its tensile strength actually increased when placed under intense pressure. Though such an occurrence seemed to defy all laws of physics (and science in general), field tests in other environments and conditions confirmed these results.<br />
<br />
The end result of this was thought to be the grandest Specialist project since the Seven Walls--the construction of undersea conduits to link the land transportation systems of all 289 islands. However, only one of the planned &quot;supersubways&quot;--the one linking Home Island to the 3rd Province--was completed.<br />
<br />
The project was interrupted by what is regarded as the greatest disaster of all time.<br />
<br />
THE ASTEROID IMPACT<br />
<br />
It was a fateful day when the &quot;doomsday Asteroid&quot; hit Plutonia. The oceanic impact sent waves in every direction, having a devastating effect on all nations.<br />
<br />
Even Perfection's, no matter how hard he tries to write out of it :p<br />
<br />
Being a nation composed mostly of low-lying islands, the Specialists were hit especially hard. Entire administrative districts (more info in the 2nd Spoiler below this paragraph) were submerged under no less than 25 feet of water. The surge even smashed through all seven walls of the Home Island, and though much of its energy was absorbed by clashing with the monstrous barriers, the swell was still strong enough to topple the Council Building while the 290 were still in session, leading to the virtual elimination of the central government.<br />
<br />
Officially, all of the 290 are recorded to have perished in the massive tsunami. However, the documents regarding their demise are kept under &quot;perpetual classification&quot; by the Senate that arose after the Cataclysm. This has led to some speculation regarding whether or not all the bodies were actually recovered from the collapsed structure...<br />
<br />
The Specialist nation is divided into five administrative districts, and these districts are subdivided into provinces consisting of one island each. Since the archipelago is roughly circular, the arrangement can be compared to the shape of a doughnut.<br />
<br />
The Central District is, roughly, the &quot;hole&quot; of the doughnut, and is centered around Home Island. The other four districts, known collectively as the Outer Rim, are named, rather unassumingly, for their position in the archipelago: the Northeast District, Northwest District, Southeast District, and Southwest District.<br />
<br />
Most devastating of all is that all of the Chosen, who had only begun to become aware of their psychic abilities, had perished in the flooding. However, one loss was not notably missed: the entire Cult movement leadership was wiped out, and afterward, with no one to guide them, the remainder of the Cultists committed suicide shortly thereafter.<br />
<br />
Recovery<br />
<br />
After the waters receded, the Specialist nation was vastly different than it had been. Scores of islands, once bustling communities, were littered with rubble, seaweed, bodies, and stranded fish. In the Northwest District, entire islands, hit by the full force of the massive onrush, had been &quot;sandblasted,&quot; with not a single trace remaining to show that they had been inhabited by human beings. The Southeast District, on the other hand, though still battered, remained relatively intact, as most of the fury had been spent by then.<br />
<br />
The death toll, when completed, was in the millions. Many forms of inter-island communication had been knocked out. The nation appeared on the verge of collapse after it became apparent that the Chosen, on whom the people had relied for guidance for centuries, were extinguished.<br />
<br />
In an ironic twist of fate, one of the larger islands in the north was split in half as the receding floodwaters carried millions of tons of soil and shattered bedrock out to sea, resulting in the creation of the &quot;290th Province&quot; the Specialists had been so eager to find.<br />
<br />
However, while many were paralyzed by shock, other took action to restore the nation. A &quot;Provisional Council&quot; was set up to restore order and central government. The Bird Corps was given a high-priority role in reestablishing contact between all the islands. Within a few weeks, the nation was restored under central leadership.<br />
<br />
However, there remained the problem of communication and reconstruction. The Bird Corps was overburdened with the knockout of telegraph and telephone lines, and there was very little manpower to clear away all the rubble and rebuild the entire nation from scratch. The Provisional Council thus gave orders to the provincial governors to take what action they could until federal assistance could be provided on a large scale. Some of the smaller islands were even evactuated and their populations assigned with rebuilding and relocating to other islands.<br />
<br />
Two years after the Asteriod, the nation had sufficiently recovered, though it was still a long way to returning to the glorious past. With no Chosen caste to lead the nation, a new constitution was drawn up, and the Provisional Council gave way to the new Senate of the Specialist Republic.<br />
<br />
One of the first acts of the Senate was to perform a &quot;revision&quot; of the official Specialist history, with all mention of the Chosen, psychic powers, etc. omitted. This was part of a massive policy to reeducate the people and make them forget about their &quot;oppressive&quot; past. Of course, according to the new version of history, many questions are left unanswered, suggesting to many scholars that the government is trying to hide something...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The wave and seismic shock of the asteroid hit Towelite lands first.  Considering the altitude of the land and the proxmity to the impact site, all of Towelland was flooded.  In many areas at least half a dozen feet deep of earth was swept away.  Millions of miles of optic fiber was displaced and buried under the settling mud.  Weaker parts of the networks broke off completely, creating many smaller networks.  These smaller networks could still span hundreds of miles, although the location of nodes was now lost.  Over time the self-repairing towel fibers placed throughout the optic fibers would reconnect the systems, but that process could take decades.  Many of the basic buildings and brains were protected by synthetic nylon bags.  Towels do not have a problem diffusing oxygen in water, but most of the deaths were due to being buried under thousands of tons of mud weighed down by water.<br />
<br />
AFTERMATH<br />
<br />
The Towel Empire was little but mud once the wave subsided.  Many of the communication nodes had changed location or been buried under tons of mud in protective nylon cages.  Once the mud dried in the sun, it would be nearly impossible to salvage the nodes without heavy equipment and locating them would be equally difficult.  This optical net had allowed Towelie and his administrative council to run the Towel Empire efficiently and maintain control through the brains.  It was weeks before Towelie even located one of the surface nodes.<br />
<br />
TOWEL KINGDOMS<br />
<br />
During that time the brains, who were always connected with the nodes and occasionally buried like them, realized their central controller was no longer there.  Many of the surviving towels went to the brains, wherever they could find them since they had always been a source of wisdom.  The brains used this dependance to their advantage, becoming rulers of pocket towel kingdoms.  Even though they had access to the system, most of the nodes were buried.  Most towels lived in ignorance of their leadership and reverted to older and more ancient ways of life.  Descandents of these 'free-willed' twoels tended to regard the brains as demons and attack their followers.<br />
<br />
Most of the technology and knowledge of the day survived through the brains.  The infrastructure and the organization required to support it did not exist in most of the kingdoms.  Industries and reserach had to be done on a much smaller scale.<br />
<br />
Each of the leader brains assumed a name from ancient Towel myth for their kingdoms.<br />
<br />
Perseus - This brain's network extended over the whole of the southern island and the western half of the island to the north.  Although most of the souther island's nodes displaced considerably from their original locations, the nodes mostly remained above the surface.  Due to this fact it was estimated over 90% of the occupants of the southern island were in Perseus's communication range.  The northern island saw many of the nodes trapped dozens of miles in the ocean.  Saturation is so light it could be considered non-existant, at barely 5%.<br />
<br />
Cth'ulu - This brain had the other half of the second most southern island.  It suffered from little saturation, but its size helped hide its presence from the far more powerful Perseus.  Cth'ulu speculated based on its own experience that most of the other brains would be in similair dire straights.  It had many problems with descendants of the free-willed towels attacking its strongholds.<br />
<br />
Romulus - This brain controlled many parts of the southern peninsula.  it had the same sea-drift problems with its nodes as Cth'ulu.  Most of the good farm-land eroded away, making the farming of magic root nearly impossible.  However, much of the earth layer that had made mining difficult had been removed.  Romulus started a long program of moving his towels into subterranean homes where minerals could be extracted for export.<br />
<br />
Vishnu - This brain controlled the land west of the mountain range.  At first most of the nodes were buried, but due to heavy precipitation mnay of them dug themselves out of the thick mud.  This helped increase the effectiveness of Vishnu considerably.  Overall satutaiton was roughly 40% of native textiles.  Vishnu had easy access to HAL in the mountains and the perfectionists.  In the past Towelie had supported an anti-perfectionist policy, but Vishnu never saw the reason.  Perfection was strong and a good trading partner who could spread natural textiles throughout his empire.  The Towelie supporters in the mountains could not be removed without considerable militay force, which Vishnu hoped the Perfectaionists could supply.  Due to their organization, Vishnu coudl still produce many of the advanced weapons and brain systems that had sold well int he past.<br />
<br />
Thor - This brain controlled the land east of the mountain range.  Unlike Vishnu, the land was dry on this side.  Most of the network lay impotent under dozens of feet of dirt.  The land was extra fertile, however, and Thor used his agricultural knowledge to make super-efficient farms.  This gave him the leverage to controll Towel chieftains and operate a feudal system of sorts.  Of course the highly organized and developed mountain range was the envy of Thor.  Taking it would be impossible iwthou the help of the wolves, a long-time ally of Thor and his minions.<br />
<br />
HAL - This brain now controlls the mountainous region of the former Towel Empire.  The impact only took out 10% of the nodes, but cut them off from the rest of the towel empire.  All the nodes near Towelie and his council were among the casuualties.  During the search, HAL quickly consolidated power and removed his former masters from power.  Towelie and the council fled to Plutonia as exiles, taking many of their technological secrets with them.  They also took the methods of utilizing the Black Cloth, the towel espionage network, from HAL, who had no knowledge of it himself.  HAL quickly reorganized and restructured the industries.  Without the other regions though, they had to specialize in brain products and metallurgical products.  However, they maintained the best towel air corp with which to trade to all the other nations, who needed their servcies in the aftermath.</div></div><hr />

Being very well adapted for science and technology, he spotted the asteroid a few months before impact.  So in preparation, he evacuated his people in the low lying coastal areas, and built up breakwaters to lessen the damage, also the buildings were retrofitted to safeguard from impact induced tremors.<br />
<br />
Impact:  The impact did significant damage to the evacuated coastal regions, no lives were lost due to the extraordinary planning abilities of the collective.<br />
<br />
Post impact:  Since all equipment was trucked off during the evacuation, the rebuilding of the coastal areas was very swift.  The Perfection Collective returned to normalcy within 2 years of impact thanks to proper planning.</div></div><hr />

-High Orbit Over Y214-B<br />
<br />
&quot;Whatever this is, it must be important.&quot;<br />
Spencer had been called once again to the private office of Yuri2356. Little had changed since his last visit, when he had reported the sighting of the Asteroid. Little of intrest had happened in that time, it was hard to belive that a full year had passed. The station had resumed it's orbit over the planet, and regular operation continued as it had before. The appearance of this new nation, which comrade Barta had identified as the Perfection Collective, had been the only major change upon their return. Now here he was again, in the same chair, facing the same window, knowing something was about to change. As if cued by that thought, Yuri turned to face him.<br />
<br />
Yuri2356: Well comrade, I'm proud to say we're at war.<br />
<br />
Spencer: War!? Who? Where?<br />
<br />
Yuri2356: Not far from here. The Nomads have been foolish enough to move against Y347-E, Prime has decided that they have annoyed us for the final time. The decision has been made and the order given, the initiates we've gained here are to become the 428th Psy-Corps devision. The 428th is to be given a newly completed battle group, which is currently en route from the Europa shipyards. The devision will be placed under my command, with 2357, 8, and 9, serving as captains under me. Soon I will be back on the battlefield where I belong.<br />
<br />
Spencer: And what of the station?<br />
<br />
Yuri2356: *ahem*<br />
<br />
Spencer: Admiral.<br />
<br />
Yuri2356: The station is yours Comrade. The fleet will deliver your new crew upon it's arrival. The station is to be upgraded to a Class 1 Strategic commmand platform that will serve as base of operation for my new fleet, and it will all be yours to command. It's a pleasure to be the first to adress you, Captain Carvell.<br />
<br />
Spencer: Thank you sir. I will do all I can to ensure this station runs efficiently.<br />
<br />
Yuri2356:*Turning back to the window* See to it that you do. You are dismissed.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Within days the fleet arrived. Admiral Yuri2356 was transferred to his new flagship, The Sarajevo, and departed for the War. Left behind was a suply vessel designed to be dismantled and re-assembled into the new station. The process would take months to complete, but at it's end the once harmless outpost would become a deadly fortress. A clear mark of Yuri's controll over the system. On the landing deck, Captain Carvell eagerly awaited his new staff and crew...<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I'll save that for next time.....<br />
(Partly because I havn't decided on all the officers yet)<br />

On a gameplay note, You may now begin reserch into computers and simple stalites. You can start to figure out the concept of fission, but may not produce any form of weapon from it. This will elevate you to something similar to the early Cold War (50's and 60's), but without the Nukes.</div></div><hr />

A year has passed, and everything has almost retured to normal.  Much of the Lyconian territory is underwater, becoming the Lyconia Bay.  This Bay has separated the Towel Peninsula from the remaining Lyconian territory, except for a chain of mountains.  A new capital city is being built by request of alpha male Bulsara.  This city will become New Lycopolis.  The refugees, some of which were rescued with help from Mr. T, have returned to their nations.  A trade link was opened with the Plutonian Empire, trading excess vector aircraft and sky freighters.  Increase contact with the Plutonian Empire has introduced the Great Mother religion to the wolf lands, which has conflicted with the wolf worship of the Wolf Dragon.  A religious reform has allowed for both these deities to exist in the same religion as a bitheism.<br />
<br />
New regional powers has appeared in Towel territory.  The wolves decided to stay loyal and keep peace treaties with each regional leader.<br />
<br />
New scientific developments have led to the creation of electronic devises.  This included new systems for the vector aircraft (which have now broken the sound barrier) and a calculation machine known as the computer.  Computers spread beyond mathematics into other uses, including entertainment.  Sound synthesizers and gaming machines were born.  A new sound storage method was also developed based on digital.  This involves pits on a thin metal disc, protected by a plastic coating, being read by a laser, and the signal being translated into sound.  This has allowed for a higher quality reproduction than an analog magnetic tape.<br />
<br />
A strange substance was discovered, which if harnassed, could produed large amounts of energy.  The science of nuclear physics was born, and the substance was called Lyconium (known as Uranium on Earth).  Lyconium is also a deadly substance, poisoning whoever comes in contact, so research into uses was left to other nations.<br />
<br />
Bulsara was at the height of his popularity, but a disturbing fact has been discovered.  Bulsara has an incurable disease and will die within a decade.  This fact has been kept as a secret.<br />
<br />
An submarine expedition was sent into Lyconia Bay to help show the wolf ancestory.  A mysterious box was discovered...</div></div><hr />

<br />
**As the months went by, the fish population slowly returned to normal. Wheat was also beginning to reappear. Immediately, expeditions were sent to rebuild Pisces and Scorpi Centauri. In Volcano City, science made new discoveries. One was &quot;nuclear fission.&quot; Scientists theorized that it could be a new source of power. The President agreed. At the same time, a new invention was introduced: computers. The first computers were like the first computers on earth: big and bulky. With the advent of computers, science began to accelerate rapidly. Within months, after someone said something about &quot;gravity,&quot; primitive space flight was possible.<br />
<br />
**The first construction project in Pisces Centauri was the construction of a space program center, and the construction of a bigger airport, because before the asteroid, there were numerous incidents where PlutoCons landed too quickly, resulting in the planes rolling off the runway and smashing into skyscrapers, so &quot;larger airport&quot; really just means &quot;longer runways.&quot; P.C. was also the birthplace of the world's first nuclear power-plant, of which 3 would provide enough power for the entire city, and much better than using 100 coal power plants, greatly reducing pollution. Within months, majestic skyscrapers once again adjourned the Pisces Centaurian skyline, but it would be at least a decade before they were 2 miles high again. Reconstrucion efforts were also underway in Scorpi Centauri.<br />
<br />
**Back in Volcano City, computer science advanced rapidly. 2 years after the advent of computer technology, scientists developed &quot;transistors,&quot; and later, integrated circuit stuff. This led to the possibility of personal computers, smart bombs, etc. Eventually, Compact Disks were developed. At the president's orders, a computer game was developed. It was called.... &quot;Civilization.&quot; A year later, &quot;Civilization II&quot; came out. It was EXACTLY like Microprose's Civ2 MGE game from on Earth. Right down to the last byte. The only difference, of course, were the nations that were available. Immediately, the President used this game as one of his methods for controlling the Empire. The development of computers also allowed for much better fuel efficiency/control on airplanes, but that was nothing, for within 5 years, a better fuel source was developed. Plutonium fission combustion. Simply put, plutonium is placed in an ultra-hot environment where it is in a liquid state. A special chemical, which is volatile when mixed with liquid plutonium, is inserted into the jet engine combustion chamber, and the rest is history. For now, this technology is too dangerous for personal transport vehicles (cars, trucks, etc), and can only be used in plutocons and large rockets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Part 2: History<br />
<br />
**One day, history was made--twice.**<br />
<br />
President: 3. 2. 1. Fire.<br />
*Click, thump! Hissssss......*<br />
<br />
*The PlutoCon was flying at 62,000 feet, and under the belly, was a large rocket carrying an aluminum cylinder. As the President, who was flying the plane, looked out the cockpit, he saw the rocket blast foward from beneath the nose. Immediately, the rocket pitched up. Within a few minutes, the rocket was 90 miles up. The nose opened, and out popped the world's first artificial satellite. The purpose of the satellite was to help scientists learn more about high-altitude magnetice forces and all that stuff.*<br />
<br />
President: The satellite is in place.<br />
<br />
Science Advisor: Excellent! Good work Mr. President.<br />
<br />
President [checking stats on the instrument panel]: Hmm....<br />
<br />
Science Advisor: Mr. President, don't even think about it.<br />
<br />
President: Wha-a-at???? :mischief:<br />
*Pushes on the throttle. Engine whine increases. Plane accelerates.*<br />
<br />
Science Advisor: :aargh:<br />
<br />
*Eugene looks alternately out the window and at the instruments.*<br />
Altimeter: 62,000; 65,000; 69,000....<br />
Mach-meter: 2.1; 2.4; 3.1; 4.5....<br />
<br />
*The altitude continues increasing, the plane flies faster and faster. The plane begins to vibrate, but lightly. Beneath the plane, the ground is zipping by.*<br />
Altimeter: 79,000; 85,000; 86,000; 84,000....<br />
Mach-meter: 6.2; 6.5; 6.7; 6.69; 6.63...<br />
<br />
*Already the plane was struggling. The engines winded down a little. There was still plenty of fuel. It took more strength than usual to control the aircraft, and the plane was starting to pitch down a little*<br />
<br />
The PlutoCon: :cringe:<br />
<br />
*Eugene looks at the throttle. It was still only 1/3rd of the way up. He pushed it to maximum. Immediately, the plane pitched up, and accelerated. The engines were screaming now, and the plane was beginning to shake.*<br />
Altimeter: 90,000; 120,000; 190,000; 260,000--<br />
Mach-meter: 8.0; 13.0 23.0--<br />
<br />
*Eugene was looking out the right window. The sky above was bluish-black, and the planet curve was clearly visible. The plane was still shaking, the engines screamed louder than before, then, silence. Before his eyes, the stars popped out. The galaxy was visible. Millions of stars. He hadn't seen this many stars since the early years, 4,000 years ago, when the first watch towers were constructed along the Pisces Centaurian coast. What was a loud screaming of the engines, was now just a faint rumble. The ground below was flying by.<br />
<br />
*Eugene was the first person in space. The instrument readouts were blank (there was no atmosphere to read from). He pulled the throttle all the way back, and the rumbling ceased.*<br />
<br />
Science Advisor: Nice going, Gene. :mad:<br />
<br />
*The PlutoCon floated through space for 5 minutes before reentering. THAT (the reentering) was the tough part.<br />
<br />
*The plane began shaking again. The stars disappeared from view, and skies took over. Eugene deployed the spoilers/airbrakes to help slow down the aircraft, but that did little for a while, but eventually, he regained some control of the plane, now that the atmosphere was getting thicker and thicker. Eugene pitched the aircraft down, and instrument readings returned.<br />
<br />
*Within 15 minutes, the plane landed at Cancer Centauri.*<br />
<br />
Science Advisor: Hope you enjoyed your little joyride, because i'm quite [pissed] with you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Part 3: Artica<br />
<br />
**Soon after the President's stunt, an interest in astronomy was regained. A new observatory was built on the highest ledge of Mount Pluton in Volcano City. Soon, the Empire began learning much more about the Plutous system. The innermost planet, 17 times bigger than Y214-B (Plutonia), was the only one of its kind in the entire star system: a gas giant. 3 more planets were eventually discovered. The planet that held the Empire's interest the most was the outermost, about 26 times farther out than Plutonia/Y214-B. The outermost planet was named &quot;Artica&quot; As the years passed, telescopes got better and better. Eventually, the Empire launched the first satellite telescope, and got the clearest view yet of Artica, and learned much more about it.<br />
<br />
**Artica was 3250 miles (5200 km) wide. The surface was 35% ice. It had an active atmosphere. Artica had its own ring system, extending from 2187.5 miles (3500 km) out, to 5000 miles (8000 km) out. One day on Artica is 80 hours. The planet's orbit around Plutous was pretty normal: 3* inclination, 0.05 eccentricity, etc. Artica had one moon, which was given the name Persephena, and it was 1625 miles (2600 km) wide, exactly half of Artica's size, and orbited 50,000 miles (80,000 km) out. Like Earth's moon, one side always faced the main planet.<br />
<br />
**The Plutonian Empire decided that Artica was to someday be its future capital. They also decided to leave it up to other nations to learn more about the Plutous System.**</div></div><hr />

I'm quite surprised that your satelites havn'y noticed a 2-kilometer wide Metal sphere under construction in orbit... (for the look of the station, I'm thinking along the lines of DS9 from Start Trek, But with 4 &quot;pylon&quot; sections that connect above and below the hub, forming the framework of a sphere.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Name:<br />
The Franch Federation<br />
<br />
Government:<br />
Democracy style dictatorship. One leader on the top, with an elected Advisorate, that chooses what to, but the executive power lies with the Leader, who's the &quot;dictator&quot;. But the Advisorate can &quot;de-throne&quot; the Leader if public opinion is too much against him.<br />
<br />
Specialities:<br />
The Franch Federation (FraFed) makes the best junk food in the known universe. They're also very loyal. Their spies (they prefer to call them &quot;agents&quot;) are superb. They are benevolent towards their friends, and very malevolent towards their enemies, and they hold loooooooooooooooong grudges.<br />
<br />
Advantages:<br />
Their loyality. The people serve the FraFed unquestiningly. Their spies (agents) are highly skilled. This also means that espionage attempts against the FraFed are very likely to fail.<br />
<br />
Disadvantages:<br />
They are very trusting towards others, so they are easy to backstab. They are also very peaceful, and always try to retain peace. This results in difficulties when there is war, since the population is against the draft, and almost nobody wants to join the army.<br />

<br />
Story coming up in a few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Specialist290</div><div class="date">Oct 13, 2004, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Things were going well for the Specialists. All 290 provinces had been reclaimed, and the Specialists had managed to create small underwater laboratories under the sea using new advances in plastisteel.<br />
<br />
Soon, the Specialists noted that the Plutonians had just launched their first satellite. Slightly jealous that it wasn't one of their achievements, they launched their own satellites into space using a cruise missile launchpad on one of their minor islets.<br />
<br />
290 Islands<br />
<br />
Though there are actually about one thousand islands in the Specialist Archipelago, but only a small percentage of them (290, to be specific) are classified as &quot;provincial islands.&quot; The remaining 700-odd islands are classified as &quot;islets&quot; and are generally considered part of the island under whose provincial jurisdiction they fall.<br />
<br />
In regards to how an island is determined to be of &quot;provincial&quot; size: There must be at least one point on the island that is more than 15 miles from any oceanic coastline.<br />
<br />
Of course, someone wasn't exactly minding what they were doing and, instead of the satellite, accidentally set off six cruise missiles on widely varying trajectories.<br />
<br />
The first one was shot off into space and whacked against the side of a rather large space station that no one on Plutonia knew existed. Fortunately the warhead didn't detonate, but it did bounce of a communications array, knocking one of the antennae a little off-kilter.<br />
<br />
The second one landed in the ocean and detonated when the water pressure got a little too intense. Casualties: 60,000 fish killed by concussion, as well as a Plutonian trawler that somehow managed to get caught in the upswell.<br />
<br />
The third and fourth ones ended up in the Perfection Collective. One was a dud and only crashed through the roof of a residential barracks, but the other detonated in midair, showering a wide area with deadly shrapnel. Fortunately, the area in question was mainly farmland, so the only effects were several hundred dead cows and a sharp rise in beef prices in the Perfectionist territory a few weeks later.<br />
<br />
The fifth one just so happened to make a direct hit on one of the lesser Towelite brain's residence and obliterate it, allowing another warring Towelite faction to defeat the one it controlled and dominate the area.<br />
<br />
The final one streaked into Diamond Harbour and demolished an abandoned hotel. Of course, the hotel was regarded as an eyesore by most city dwellers and would have been torn down the next day, but the cruise missile did the job much quicker.<br />
<br />
Not surprisingly, these sudden cruise missile strikes caused a good portion of the world to panic and prepare for a major war. Accordingly, after exiling the idiot in charge of the accidental launches to a small uninhabited island just outside their territory, the Senate issued a quiet apology to the major governments of the world.<br />
<br />
The next day, the Specialists put their first satellite into orbit. Of course, since it was a rush job, someone forgot to put a camera on, and thus the giant Yuri space station remained unknown to the citizens of Plutonia. (Of course, after their communications got messed up by the cruise missile ricochet, they were having enough problems of their own. Poor Speeny.)<br />
<br />
A few weeks later, the Specialists managed to design a space station. Of course, it would be many years before such a thing could be feasibly built and launched, but the Senate and the scientists figured it would be good to have plans ready.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the Specialists launched another satellite and this time had the sense to put a camera in there. Of course, since it was pointed at the planet, the Yuri space station still managed to evade its sight (and thus STILL no one knew it existed). However, the satellite did achieve a first for the Specialists: It gave the world the first pictures of their planet as it looked from space.<br />
<br />
Ironically, the satellite managed to smash itself into the Yurian space station a few hours after the film canisters were ejected and picked up back on the planet's surface. It also rendered an airlock on one of the lower decks unusable, thus compounding poor Speeny's problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sir_schwick</div><div class="date">Oct 13, 2004, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">POSEIDON<br />
<br />
The deep ocean is an amazing place.  At first it seems like a dark and empty expanse hidden from those who rely on light to see.  One did not need eyes to feel the violent and constant torrents and rivers of water flowing at varying depths or feel the many large predatory aquatic animals and fauna.<br />
<br />
One brain and its entire network of nodes and connections was dragged thousands of feet under the surface by the pressure of the asteroid's swell.  Even in the panic of the impact it had been smart enough to release all the air from its fibers and that of its network.  Without gases to decompress, the brain survived the deep descent rather easily.  Fortunately the swell and currents buried the brain firmly into the ocean floor.<br />
<br />
It took many hours to adjust to the low light conditions and diffusing gases through the water.  After these adjustments were made, it was discovered that most Towel biological processes were much more efficient at these depths.  It was also discovered that using sound waves was the most efficient form of navigation in the depths.  Astoundingly many creatures of the textile genus were discovered floating around, although none of them seemed to be sentient.  Establishing a mental link was still simple, and soon the brain had gathered many powerful Towels of the Deep.<br />
<br />
Now was the time the brain took upon his new name, Poseidon.  He soon discovered that there was sentient and organized life in the depths; squid.  These squid were suprised by how intelligent Poseidon, a Towel, was considering there experiences with the ToDs.  Once they found out Poseidon's origin, they were curious about the surface dwellers because of their crude expansion into the new seas and lakes.  In exchange for cooperation, they would provide detailed maps of the currents and topography of the oceans of Plutonia.  Poseidon soon discovered he could directly perform a neural interface with the squids and their fish servants through his nodes.<br />
<br />
Due to the textile enhancing nature of the deep Poseidon was able to quickly expand his neural net half-way across the planet.  He even created a few more brains to increase fiber production and plan operations in the shallows.  Also, Poseidon did not forget the technologies of the surface.  Using a variety of geological thermals and mysterious materials from the asteroid, he was able to forge many incredibly strong metals and weapons.<br />
<br />
THE SHALLOWS<br />
<br />
It was amazing how primative the marine technology of the surface dwellers was.  To them the floor of the sea was a forbidding maze of dirt, dirk-weeds, and darkness.  This made survalliance much simpler as they missed the many miles of neural fiber that was sneaking on land.  Also, Poseidon had many mysterious artifacts left in the shallows.  These artifacts were really very sophisticated survellaince equipment designed to be taken by the scientists.  They contained well concealed towels that would interface with the electronics of the scientists and access critical information.  Specialist, Wolf, and Perfectionist divers never had a clue that a towel was standing two feet away from them.  Even so, the cruise missle tests and pollution were becoming a problem.<br />
<br />
THE YURI REVALATION<br />
<br />
The squid eventually revealed a strange artifact they had found long ago in the ocean floor.  They had managed to decipher its strange but very advanced language, but knew nothing of the Yuri of which it spoke.  Poseidon, using his knowledge and theories developed before the asteroid, decoded the device and its contents.  It was an data storage device that utilized a water-proof magnetic mechanism.<br />
<br />
~corrupted data~ ..on Planet Y214-B.  It appears ~corrupted data~ Obviously the cloth biological units have no use for our psionic programs.  There mental process.. ~corrupted data~...effects of Zydle White on cloth biologics is most interesting.  Although its not classic psionics, it could prove interesting...~corrupted data~...of the deep hydrosphere is unknown.  Further evaluation would require another research team, although it is doubtful any psionic life will be foudn down there.  Thermographics...~corrupted data~ ..abductions are being interpreted..~corrupted data~..Yuri deism should work to the programs objectives...~corrupted data~<br />
<br />
The description of Planet Y214-B was very much like that of Plutonia before the asteroid hit.  This alone was proof enough that Yuri was never a god but some space explorer, most likely a scientist from the notes.  Interesting, even with the little knowledge extracted, this explained several of the most important phenomenon of the past half millenia.  It also explained the origin of blow, apparently a powerful stimulant for Yuri's species.  Best of all though, this report indicates Yuri knows nothing of what occurs deep in the ocean.  This means Poseidon was fully away from prying eyes.  Also, the existance of this device indicated many more might exist deep in the oceans.<br />
<br />

<br />
ON LAND<br />
<br />
Perseus and HAL were the only two brains left of the original ruler brains.  Perseus controlled everything that was not attached to the continent.  HAL controlled the rest, with the deterrance of the A-Team and the accidental death of Thor.<br />
<br />
HAL was once again a powerful military producer and trader.  He sold cheap and expertly made weapons at discount prices to the recovering nations.  Also, the natural cloth trade flourished once again.  Millions of towels spread forth from the moutains and valleys to the Plutonian Empire, Perfection Empire, Wolf Empire, and the land of the Specialists.<br />
<br />
Perseus was still at war with HAL though.  She had become a brain used to the sensory input of battle.  Her forces were much more adept at war then even those who followed HAL.  Although not as advanced, the forces of Perseus were still starting to gain ground on the continent.  More disturbing was the continual disappearance of towels, supposedly into the sea.  EAch time a team was commited to investigating the seas, they would disappear or come up empty.  The disappearnces were getting worse and starting to cause significant damage to Perseus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anywhoo...<br />
<br />
So the Perfection collective started working on this new &quot;biotech&quot; field and got massive improvements in agriculture, we're now producing a massive amount of food, and so we adjusted for this with another baby-boom bringing a surge in population.  We produced much in terms of fission and have started experimental chain reactions, we believe this may hold promise for future weapons technology.<br />
<br />
We also built up a masive navy and grabbed all them unclaimed isles, put some big ol' bases on them.<br />

Oh, our space program is doing quite well, we've launched a GPS system as well as a system of spy satelites.  This will most certainly prove useful.<br />

I don't have three females in my whole nation! I'll be ruined!I took three of your most fit men and used them as slaves in the coal mines instead.  My I ask how you procreate without females?<br />

Don't worry, I've found three I've deemed attractive.<br />

Towels really do not have gender.  Whenever stories are told about them, towels are conceptualized in terms of gender for better understanding.  However, from what we do understand, attractive means wet, dirty, and full of disease.  Enjoy!<br />

<br />
Name: Republic of Zeon<br />
<br />
Government: Triumverate.  Consists of three heads of state who take the place of one person.  <br />
Hegemon: oversees diplomatic relations, can veto bills<br />
Polemarch: oversees senate, can veto bills<br />
Stratagos: oversees military<br />
There is also a senate which makes legislation.<br />
<br />
Specialties: Covert military operations, espionage, economic attractiveness, diplomacy<br />
<br />
Advantages:  Due to the fact that the Republic allows every type of drug to be sold(at fair markett price, with a 10% tax rate) there is a huge influx of drug users and dealers making the economy soar.  Due to the high tax rate on the drugs the government makes most its revenue from their sale.  Since drugs are sold at high prices the government can fund many programs.  Among the list of domestic prgorams are a high funded police force(to keep gangs from killing each other over turf), an extremely well funded school system, and very good healthcare.  The military is mostly compromised of old ordinance from other countries.  Diplomacy is truly this state's strong suit as it relies on other countries to supply many vital goods.<br />
<br />
Disadvantages:  Due to the fact that production is still coming along the military depends on other states for its units.  The rampant drug use causes many health problems.  Recruiting people for jobs is a problem xince over 40% of the population is high at least 2-4 times a week.<br />
<br />
Edit: I forgot so:<br />
Resources: A lot of drugs, coal, wine, some metals, timber, and a small reserve of petrolium</div></div><hr />

Umm.....yes, I would also like to declare that I am allying with Plutonian.  This is partially due to the fact that perfection declared war on our republic early this year in a thread that was closed by the mods for being an advert thread.<br />
<br />
What did we ever do to you?  We do not accept your war declaration.<br />
<br />
You never did anything to us.  It's a war of territorial conquest, and you will accept when my laser wielding satellite cooks your capital building!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rebellious posters, enemies to peace,   <br />
Profaners of this neighbour-stained text,  <br />
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,   <br />
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage   <br />
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,   <br />
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands   <br />
Throw your mistemper'd keyborads to the ground,   <br />
And hear the sentence of your moved Ref:   <br />
Three Spammy brawls, bred of an airy post,   <br />
By thee, old Perfection, and Plutonian,   <br />
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our thread,   <br />
And made CFC's ancient Members   <br />
Cast by their grave beseeming avatars,   <br />
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,   <br />
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:   <br />
If ever you should spam our thread again,   <br />
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.   <br />
For this time, all the rest depart away:   <br />
You Perfection; shall go along with me:   <br />
And, Plutonian, come you this afternoon,   <br />
To know our further pleasure in this case,   <br />
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.   <br />
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.<br />
<br />
That said, I will now isssue my judgement.<br />
To Perfection:<br />
Congrats, you win Postwar II. You have decided to rise above the literary styling of the thread and simply post a decisive movement to overthrow all others, Kudos. But the story must move on, so I've decided to reward you by promoting you to assitant ref. (as I will be away from many a weekend during the near future) During those weekends I will ask you to maintain order between posters. You must remain impartial though, and upon my return I will be allowed to veto your judgements if I deem them biased. You medal will arrive via PM in 8-10 buisness days. Again, way to go, have a celebratory doughnut.<br />
<br />
To all others:<br />
For now, we may continue out current war with the same plot we already have going (Perfection's land will be given to Zeon) We will continue as we have for the remainder of the month, but when PWIII comes in November, I'm going to ramp up the organization. I'm realy going all out next time: tech trees, terrain production, unit costs, the whole works. For the rest of October I'll be sorting out the specifics, so we can just continue as we're going for now. (with the way the new one will be set up, it'll be so structured that I throw my own nation into the mix! :evil:) <br />
<br />
For now, continue as if Perfection's last post never happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the hills of the east lies the FraFed capital of Fjellstad. The FraFed is a relatively new faction on this planet, and therefore little is known about them.<br />
<br />
Known facts:<br />
 - Leader: The Leader. Nobody knows his real name.<br />
 - Cities: Fjellstad (capital), Neo Narvik, Bodo Major and Nidaros, of which Fjellstad and and Nidaros lie in the hills, and Neo Narvik and Bodo Major lie on the coast.<br />
<br />
And the story goes on:<br />
Neo Narvik and Bodo Major where both almost drowned by the floodwave. Only the upper quarters of the cities were spared. This took the FraFed completely by surprise. This led to improved safety precautions, &quot;just in case&quot;.<br />
The FraFed quickly learned that uranium could be used for making power. But sadly, the first experimantal reactor suffered a meltdown. This made the people very sceptical towards nuclear power, of course. The only good thing was that the reactor was built in the ruins of Neo Narvik, so the casualties were minimal. Hydro Power still seemed the best alternative.<br />
Soon after the Neo Narvik Meltdown, a scientist named Peter Homan started speculating if pizza could be used as a power source. His works were criticised for being totally crazy, of course, but he didn't give up, even though all of his funding was cut, and nobody wanted to listen to him anymore after he made an unsuccesful attempt at showing its usefulness.<br />
<br />
In the meantime the reconstruction of Bodo Major started. Nothing could be done about the nuclear wasteland that was formerly known as Neo Narvik City. But the spirits were high. The Franch Federation (FraFed) had just become an actor on the international stage. Only The Leader had his doubts.</div></div><hr />

Since the state of Perfection won and mysteriously disappeared the citizens there have been free from Mao-ist like oppression.  There the Zeonian government rose up from a political theory developed by its first Hegemon, zeon252.  The rest of the government was filled out and the citizens were happy.  However, revenue was a problem, despite the fact that the school system needed revitalization the military was small and the production centers were not producing very much.  A few days after the foundation of the state the idea was proposed that since the price of illegal drugs was very high, and othewr countries had fought a massive drug war against them, driving the price even higher.  Since the country was massively in debt particulaly to the plutonian empire, the resolution was quickly passed.  Immediatly afterward drugs users, dealers, and selected mafia kingpins flocked to the area and little drug shops and huge  drug superstores opened and the population exploded.  Due to the high 10% tax rate the Zeonian coffers were filled and the debts to Plutonian Empire were paid off.<br />
     The Zeonian empire, with its chief import/export as drugs quickly funded new schools, police forces, an espionage facility, and a better military.  There was also a push to create a nuclear program, for defence and energy.  However, Zeon still remained dependant on the other militaries for its defence and proposed to pay for tanks and ordinance from other countries such as the plutonian empire and the towelites.<br />
     There was also a large push for a good health care system, mostly because of the huge amounts of drug overdoses and really bad hangovers.  The espionage center was also established and began distributing misinformation, or did it?  You'll never know :P<br />
<br />
     The navy was also funded with a huge amount of ZICs(Zeonian International Currency) for the developement of aircraft carriers and advanced submarine technology and soon the zeonian navy was formed and covered all sides of the island making it nearly invulnerable from both sea and air.  Zeon is still looking for more land though, and future meetings of the Senate war commitee will decide the fate of other nations..............</div></div><hr />

EXPANSION-<br />
<br />
The A-team have always had one major problem-POPULATION<br />
they have only ever had 7 people in their nation, but all is sson to change-<br />
<br />
1) The American A team set off in search for their long lost relatives and found many:<br />
French ateam<br />
German<br />
Italian<br />
Spanish<br />
Japanese<br />
Indian<br />
AND OTHERS<br />
<br />
2) They then found some old friends- Airwolf, Bluethunder, Nightrider, Goliath and others.<br />
<br />
3) They founded &quot;Youth Centers&quot; wich soon became a worldwide hit with the modern children all being intelectuals that ate their greens and drank milk.<br />
<br />
4)They formed-A team juniors- a group of MINI-A-team wich went out to stop bullying across the land<br />
<br />
PREPARATION-<br />
<br />
1) The a-team also made a large amount of weapons in case of any threat-something that was extremely likely in this era<br />
<br />
2) They made a HUGE collection of RETRO TV music-with 16 versions of airwolf, 5 of A-team etc (i'm listening to it now :) )<br />
<br />
&quot;PROTECTION&quot;-<br />
<br />
It had occured to Hannibal that The Mole People were extremely disrespectful and needed a lesson- They sent in the French A-team who dealt out a lot pf KICK ASS to the MOLE SUCKAS, they then left a note on a dead mole sayin &quot;I pity the foo who don't DRINK HIS MILK!&quot; :p</div></div><hr />

(I shrunk down the image from that screenshot you gave me, and used a slighly altered pic of DS9 for the station, which is still under construction)<br />
<br />
---===USRY Volovgrad Hight orbit over Y214-B===---<br />
<br />
Captain Spencer Carvell was once again in that same office, with the same window, over the same planet, but now things were different. Now, it was His office, his station, his world. If only he had the time to enjoy his new position. The upgrades were far behind schedule, for every new component installed annother would fail. The station was contantly falling victim to the incompetence of the new crew, and to top it al off the station was practicly being bombarded by crude satelites lunched by the natives on the surface below. <br />
<br />
Spencer:I would destroy them, but these idiots have yet install the main weapons systems! *sigh* Might as well see what they've managed to screw up today. Eva, could you transfer the staff reports to my office. Eva, Eva? And now the computer is down AGAIN! Sphere controll, this is you captain thinking, Chrono me to engineering.<br />
<br />
Matheson: This is Matheson at Sphere Controll, Message recived. Chronoshift in progress... <br />
<br />
The room was filled with a faint whine as space-time began to warp, and with a characteristic flash of blue Spencer was standing at the doorway to the engineering bay. At least his officers knew what they were doing. With a pneumatic hiss the door slid open to reveal the vast open chamber within. The cavernous are was bustling with activity as technicians rushed about, inspecting and maintaining the heart of the station. Spencer quickly confined his attention to the lift that wold take bring him to the floor above, from which the main computer oversaw the entire facility. <br />
<br />
Spencer:She'd better have a damned good reason for being offline at a time like this.<br />
<br />
As the lift slowed to a stop the human, but mechanized voice of Brother Anton Slavick greeted him. Slavic wore a loose brown robe, similar to those worn by Chritian monks of Earth, save that it bore the red mark of the scorpion tail upon the hood, the symbol of the Brotherhood of NOD.<br />
In this alternate future of the C&amp;C universe, Yuri allowed the Brotherhood to live on as a free entity as a reward for their friendship with the Soviet Union during the Red Alert wars. When the Tiberian asteroid came it impacted on Mars rather than Earth and transformed the red planet into a lush, Tiberian-based ecosystem. Kane recognised the potential for this alien mineral (Just as he did in the original C&amp;C) and began the great migration which brought his followers to live in this new paradise. NOD has since been mutated by their surroundings and become a completley new sub-species of humanity. Their innovative work with energy weapons and cybernetics has contributed much to the spread of the USRY. They continue to live under Yuri to this very day.<br />
A gleam of light reflected from the device installed over Anton's left Eye, an elaborate scanning system that was embedded into him upon graduation from the Brotherhood Institute of technology (Along with an adaptive multi-tool contained within his right wrist) As he spoke, his voice was slightly distorted by his artificial larynx, which he'd had since birth. A genetic defect that would have redered him mute, was now just a mere inconvinence.<br />
<br />
Slavick: Captain, what an unexpected surprise.<br />
<br />
Spencer: I am not in the mood for this, why isn't Comrade Eva active?<br />
<br />
Slavick: I'm affraid I had to disconnect her sir, she's been in a bit of pain after these recent power surges. I've been trying to locate the exact cause of the problem but have yet to reach any solid conclusions.<br />
<br />
Spencer: I thught you were getting the shields online.<br />
<br />
Slavick: I've assigned Ensign Gillham to that task, I'm the only one here who's qualified to perform work on cybernetic systems, so Eva's well-being is my highest priority.<br />
<br />
Spencer: When can you have her back up?<br />
<br />
Slavick: That would depend on the magnitude of the problem, it could be anywhere from a few hours to a few days.<br />
<br />
Spencer: Is there any way to keep her operating while you perform your investigation?<br />
<br />
A feminine cut in from the nearby workroom.<br />
<br />
Eva: Not if you want to live.<br />
<br />
She was laying with her face towards the floor on the operating table, her lean body fitting smoothly into the contours of the surface. Her bronze hair parted to reveal the uplink node beneath it. The rest of her body was clad in a tight blue uniform which had been partialy unzipped where work was being done on a number of Spinal connections.<br />
<br />
Slavick: I belive it would be best if I returned to my work, the sooner I can finish with Eva the sooner I can move on to other tasks.<br />
<br />
Spencer:*Deep angry sigh* Fine, continue. I have other things to tend to as will. Initialize one of the AIs to cover for her while you figure this out. Just a bad start of annother day on USRY Volovgrad...<br />
<br />
That's all for now folks!</div></div><hr />

Okay, what exactly does that mean? Does it mean that, if someone attacks me, or yuri bombards the planet, while I'm gone (forced to skip a turn or 2), you (or Yuri) will determine the results?</div></div><hr />

So that's what the angry PM you sent me was all about. I understand that you want some speed in this, but it's a poor rule, for reasons PE mentioned.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't need PMs from three different posters that it's my turn. I live in a different time zone than most of you, so please excuse me if I'm late. It's enough that the poster who had the previous turn PMs me.</div></div><hr />

That's why we give you 24 hours. As long as you visit on a more-or-less daily basis, you will have your turn. Next time I think I'll arrange the turn order to be a bit more time-zone friendly though...</div></div><hr />

1) if your going away you could PM your turn to a ref and they can alter it if somethings happens.<br />

2) you could declare youll be away and take your turn later, so if you were second you would become fifth</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Davidizer13</div><div class="date">Oct 19, 2004, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanx, Yuri! Sorry I couldn't respond sooner. Here's my story!<br />
The Bathosian colonizer ships hove closer to the ravaged planet. &quot;Status report!&quot; &quot;Planet scan complete, sir!&quot; The Bathosian military scans had picked up signs of life. &quot;Sir, I suggest we land here,&quot; said Fisher as he brought up the reports to Davidizer13 from E-Arth(Earth, see?). <br />
&quot;That's the biggest crater I have ever seen!&quot; &quot;We estimate it at about 400 kilometers across. It had to be a chunk of the planet SR2785, smashed by the Doomsday asteroid, just three weeks ago.&quot; <br />
&quot;Put us down on the edge of the islands! It looks like Bathos, anyway!&quot; <br />
&quot;Yes, Sir! You heard him! Relay the message to the forward crafts!&quot;<br />
The descent took several hours, but they landed close to a small town.<br />
&quot;Sir, it appears to be an empire of islands! It's controlled by (whats his name, controls the chain of islands...).&quot;<br />
&quot;Take the city, you fools!&quot;<br />
As the Bathosian military formed a fire line, one of them had an unpleasant discovery.<br />
&quot;Commander! My blaster won't fire!&quot; &quot;Neither will my plasma cannon!&quot; <br />
As it turned out, none of the plasma, laser, particle, or even the deck defense lasers on the colonizer ships would fire.<br />
&quot;Fisher! Report! What's going on over there?&quot;<br />
&quot;It's our weapons! Do a surface scan of the planet!&quot;<br />
&quot;It says that they're some kind of paramagnetic effect of the planet that causes our weapons to fail on the surface of the planet!&quot;<br />
&quot;I have an idea, though! THIS IS AN OPEN COMM TO ALL CIVILIZATIONS ON THE PLANET! IF YOU STILL SURVIVED THE CHUNK OF THE DOOMSDAY PLANET, I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU! SEND US 1000 TONS OF MAGNALITHIUM(a fuel required for the spacecraft) AND... What was that? Very little deposits of magnalithium? In that case... MAKE THAT 3000 GOLD TO OUR ISLAND SITE, AND WE WILL TRADE OUR WARSHIP CLASS DECK LASERS TO YOU! THEY ARE USELESS ON PLANET THOUGH. USE THEM FOR SPACE DEFENSE! COMMANDER FISHER OF THE BATHOSIANS OUT.&quot;<br />
&quot;Good, Fisher. Now send up the power beacon and dismantle the ships. We make a city here.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sir! I've discovered that the shellcasters work, and so does our conventional artillery!&quot;<br />
&quot;That will be most useful. Now start dismantling! Those ships are useless, since we don't have enough fuel to get off this rock.&quot;<br />
The colonizers began to take metal plating and supplies off the spaceships in order to build the capital of New Bathos.<br />
NOTE: Bathosians are usually peaceful, but they can defend themselves. They just wanted to scout out the planet in this case!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chukchi_Husky</div><div class="date">Oct 19, 2004, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Mystery Box<br />
The box discovered in Lyconia Bay went directly to the scientific institute in New Lycopolis to be analysed by subordinate May.  The box is large enough to hold two quadruped wolves inside (the quadruped wolf is the evolutionary ancestor to the biped wolf).  The age of the box is over 10 million years old, placing it to the same time as the appearance of the first wolves on Plutonia.  The technology of the box is very advanced, which initially seemed that an ancient civilisation once existed on Plutonia that kept quadruped wolves as pets, but this theory did not last very long, because soon afterwards a recorded video message stored in the computer of the box began to play.<br />
	<br />
	Greetings to whoever has received this message.  My name is Quentin Leah, a scientist working in Los Alamos, New Mexico, United States of America, Earth, and the date of this message is 27 July, 1972.<br />
	This will probably be my last recorded message.  I have remained immune to Yuri’s psychic powers ever since the Soviet invasion, but recently I am suffering headaches, an indication that I am soon to fall into Yuri’s powers.  Yuri will enslave the Earth very soon.  I hope Einstein and our forces come up with a plan soon.  I also have a plan.<br />
	This device is a chronosphere designed to carry two organisms to a pre-determined location.  The organisms I have selected for transportation are two canis lupus, one of each gender, as the canis lupus one of the species that is immune to human psychic control.  The location chosen is a recently discovered planet that shares similar characteristics to Earth.<br />
	Yuri is a lunatic.  He wants to control the Earth under his communist will.  He has developed new psychic technology to turn the entire population into mindless drones.  I hope that these wolves can escape the psychic eye of Yuri to escape freely and survive to this unknown planet and in the future have an evolved race that could one day return to Earth to liberate the population from Yuri’s will.<br />
	These wolves shall be the legacy of the Earth that shall soon fall to Yuri.<br />
	I must hurry; the headaches are starting to become worse.<br />
The message then suddenly ended, showing a star map with a vector from Plutonia to the location of Earth.<br />
<br />
This message has answered the questions involving wolf evolution and genetic makeup, like why no wolf fossil has been found to be older than this box, and why the genetic makeup of the wolves differ largely from the other races of Plutonia.  The Wolf Science Institute are trying to discover what this “chronosphere” is, and how it works.   The religious community claim that the human in the message had divine guidance by the Wolf Dragon to send the wolves to Plutonia, escaping Yuri.  Unfortunately, Yuri has arrived to this planet, and the observatory has discovered a large spherical object in orbit above Plutonia.  Now there is the belief that Yuri has come to Plutonia to enslave the wolves in the same way that the humans of Earth were enslaved, but the wolf abducted did not suffer the headaches found in the human abducted, so the wolves must have remained immune to psychic control, like their evolutionary ancestors from Earth.<br />
<br />
The Tragedy of Bulsara<br />
Soon after the public knew of the discovery of the Mystery Box, alpha male Bulsara dies.  It was believed that the disease that he suffered (which was announced a day before) was inflicted by Yuri.  Elliot from Leppard City became the new alpha male after the elections held in the realm.  Elliot leaves the city, with Savage becoming beta.<br />
<br />
Giving Wings<br />
The wolves improve their vectored thrust turbofan engines, and their air force of V/STOLs became the most advanced in Plutonia.   A trade agreement between Lyconia and the Plutonian Empire has given the wolves the original plans for the PlutoCon.  The wolves decided to improve this by removing the original engines of the PlutoCon and adding a powerful-vectored thrust turbofan with swivelling nozzles in key areas relative to the centre of gravity.  The new design, called PlutoCon MkII, was given to the Plutonian Empire.<br />
The A-Team's new helicopter, Airwolf, was upgraded by the wolves.  A vectored thrust turbofan was added to the helicopter, which greatly improved it's flying stability, and it's speed was increased to Mach 2.<br />
<br />
New Friends<br />
In the east, the wolves made contact with the Franch Federation.  FraFed psychology had the same loyalty found in wolf psychology, so these two nations quickly became allies.  In their capital Fjellstad, the wolves built an embassy.  The wolves gave aid to the FraFed, as they recently suffered from an explosion from an experimental power plant.<br />
<br />
New Thoughts in the West<br />
In the west, something strange happened to the population of the Perfection Collective.  The people began to think independently.  The accepted reason is that their head, Perfection, disappeared.  The population claimed that he transcended.  A new country formed, called by the population the Republic of Zeon.<br />
<br />
Space… not yet!<br />
The wolves looked at the other nations’ attempts at space travel.  The wolves waited until technology for reusable space vehicles to become available before attempting space travel.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PlutonianEmpire</div><div class="date">Oct 19, 2004, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part 1: The Origin of the Plutonian Empire<br />
**The Empire loved the new jets. More so, because they saw that PlutoCons were very flexible. The Empire kept both versions of the PlutoCons, because the older plutocons used &quot;plutonium fission combustion,&quot; which was crucial in powered space flight. The challenge was creating a skin that could withstand the heat of reentry. Also, the Empire developed &quot;VCR's&quot; and portable video cameras, where people can insert a videotape, record, and play it back on a vcr.<br />
<br />
**When the Empire learned of the box found by the wolves, they immedieately began to get interested in their own origins. As soon as the president heard the name, &quot;Earth,&quot; a very familiar feeling struck him, almost as if he had been there before...<br />
<br />
**Chukchi Huski's adoptive parents had been killed in the initial apocalypse (the asteroid), so with no-one else to adopt him, the President decided to take him into the First Family. As Chukchi grew up, he had a wonderous life. His classmates at school never teased him of his appearance, and he was spoiled rotten. Even his older sister got jealous on occasion, but then again, he's family. He went on to graduate college, although sometimes his classmates liked to tease him because his older sister was his teacher in one of his classes.<br />
<br />
*One morning, Chukchi Huski was walking to his new job as a reporter at PIN when he spotted a strange looking object sticking out of a sand dune (the new PIN headquarters/broadcast station was right up beside a beach). He went to pull it out of the dune. It took a lot of effort, but he managed to pull it out. It was big, bulky, and had some sort of bluish diamond in the front. It was warm to the touch. Huski looked around, and saw that he was in a small crater. He recalled the falling star and subsequent explosion he saw the night before, amazed that no one came to investigate. He looked at the object, and decided to return it to his adoptive father, President Eugene Stauffer of the Plutonian Empire.**<br />
<br />
President: Chukchi! What are you doing back?<br />
<br />
Chukchi: Dad, I found this along the beach.<br />
*Hands over the object*<br />
<br />
*Eugene instantly had that same feeling: he had seen it before, but couldn't remember.*<br />
<br />
President: Hmm... :hmm: Looks like some sort of weapon.... Call your work Chukchi. Tell them that you're going to be late.<br />
<br />
*Eugene takes it to Pisces Centauri labs for further study.*<br />
<br />
Science Advisor: Hmm, this is an interesting contraption. Wait, what's this?<br />
*Detaches a box from the weapon.*<br />
<br />
President: Probably some sort of advanced video recording thing..<br />
<br />
Science Advisor: Well then! Let us watch the movie....<br />
*Connects it to a video display.*<br />
<br />
*As soon as playback began, the President recognized the voice and the face immediately--it was his own. The only difference was that his brown hair did not have purple streaks. As the playback progressed, it was learned that the Plutonian Empire on Plutonia was a last-ditch attempt at survival.*<br />
...Everything was going well against the war with Yuri, until this horrendous new species appeared seemingly out of nowhere. They called themselves &quot;Perfectionists.&quot; Before we knew it, our Empire has been reduced to a single tri-ship. Our last stand is here on the innermost planet of a star named &quot;Deneb&quot; We don't know what has happened to our friends on Belle Hades, the outermost planet, but we can only assume that they have been brutally murdered by the evil Perfectionists.<br />
*An explosion could be heard in the background of the playback.*<br />
Damn, don't have much longer...<br />
*The president (the one in the video) picks up a device. It was the exact same weapon that Chukchi found on the beach.*<br />
This is called a chronoscepter. I got this idea from a video game called &quot;Turok: Dinosoar Hunter.&quot; Here's a demonstration...<br />
*The President in the video points it at the door, pulls the trigger, and holds it. The chronoscepter starts shaking. Just as he lets go of the trigger, the door opens with Perfectionist troops storming in. They never had a chance, for the chronoscepter fired a bright blue ball of light, going so fast, it left a blue streak. The ball of light hit the perfectionist troops. Their bodies exploded in a most gruesome manner.*<br />
Damn, I'm good... All right. I have prepared a rocket. On it is the genetic code for us. We have altered it so that you would have a ridged spine, and brown hair with purplish streaks. We have found a perfectly good planet. So far, neither perfection or yuri seem to have discovered it yet. This rocket will travel back into time about 300 million years, giving the planet, which we have named &quot;Plutonia,&quot; enough time to nurture you: our last chance at survival. You will start out as primordial ooze, then evolve into sentient beings about 8,000 bc, Earth time. The chronoscepter will be put on a second rocket, which will orbit the largest, brightest star in the entire galaxy: LBV-1806-20. It is 40 million times brighter than either Sol or Plutous, the name we gave to the star that Plutonia orbits.<br />
This is a real life star. Look it up on the internet, and you should see the star for yourself.<br />
When the time is right, the rocket carrying the chronoscepter will leave 1806-20, and head for plutonia. You are seeing this recording obviously because I attached it to the chronoscepter. I should warn you--the chronoscepter is a very dangerous weapon. Do not--DO NOT--let it fall into the wrong hands. This is all. I will now show you a map of the galaxy.<br />
*The screen turned black, and a image of the galaxy slowly appeared. About halfway between the core and the edge of the galaxy towards the bottom of the screen (to the south), a dot appeared, and the label &quot;earth appeared next to it. 3227 LY away to the left of Earth was Deneb. About north-northwest of the core was LBV 1806-20 about 45,000 lightyears from Earth. Then a dot, appeared on the map. It was halfway between earth and the core, but it was north east of the core instead. Next to that dot appeared the label &quot;Plutonia.&quot; A circle going through the Plutonia dot then appeared. That circle was the orbit of Plutous. It went as close as 10,000 lightyears away from the core, but then went all the way out to the very edge of the galaxy.<br />
<br />
*A second orbit appeared. It was 1806-20's orbit. The view then switched to 3d. It showed Plutous orbit crossing 1806-20's orbit. It would go as close as 80 lightyears from LBV 1806-20, then move away. The map became animated. To the top-right of the screen, was the phrase &quot;Time passed between the arrival of the first rocket at Plutous and the chronoscepter landing on Plutonia.&quot; Below the phrase was the Earth-date. As the time progressed, the stars of the galaxy moved. At first, 1806-20 was nowhere to be seen, but eventually appeared about 2 million years bc. 1806-20's speed remained relatively constant. Plutous moved out to the edge, then back again. The time began at 300 million bc, stopped at November 15, 2,800 AD. It also would have been the Old Plutonian Empire's President's 816th birthday. The animations showed Plutous crossing 1806-20's orbit a few times, then stopping very close to it at the end of the animation. The new positions showed Plutous just 1700 light years away from LBV 1806-20.*<br />
<br />
Science Advisor: So that's why we've been seeing secondary shadows in daytime in recent centuries!<br />
<br />
*The screen went blank, and said &quot;End of Recording. Good Luck, New Plutonian Empire!&quot;<br />
<br />
*Charlie, the Military advisor, burst in.*<br />
<br />
Charlie: Mr. President! The Perfectionists have just disappeared!<br />
<br />
President: They probably transcended to godhood.<br />
<br />
Charlie: :dubious: Sir?<br />
<br />
President: Watch the video...<br />
<br />
*A few minutes later*<br />
<br />
Charlie: So that explains everything.<br />
<br />
*The President's wife, Amy walks in.*<br />
<br />
Amy: Gene I nee-- What in the world is that contraption?!<br />
*Points to the chronoscepter*<br />
<br />
President: :lol: Watch the video... :D<br />
<br />
*Another few minutes later*<br />
<br />
Amy: I see.... :hmm:<br />
<br />
President: It also explains why everything now seems so much familiar, like deja vu. Chukchi?<br />
<br />
Chukchi Huski: Yes, dad?<br />
<br />
President: You just got your first major story. :D<br />
<br />
Chukchi: :clap: Better call the station then!<br />
<br />
*2 hours later, the news broke on PIN.*<br />
<br />
**Eventually the New Plutonian Empire managed to reverse engineer the chronoscepter and mass produce it. Soon, the chronoscepter was the weapon of choice everywhere. It was used in military training, installed on PlutoCons, and even satellites.**<br />
<br />
Science Advisor: Mr. President, I have been tracking the satellites of the other nations...<br />
<br />
President: Yes?<br />
<br />
Science Advisor: Many of them keep crashing into a large metal object in space, presumably a Yuri space station.<br />
<br />
President: Ohh... :sad: Looks like they need some help.<br />
<br />
Science Advisor: Don't forget that the Old Empire was at war with them.<br />
<br />
President: And don't forget that the Old Empire was destroyed by Perfection many years ago.<br />
<br />
Science Advisor: Oh, yeah. Sorry, I forgot.<br />
<br />
Part 2: New Nations<br />
**Soon, chronoscepter-equipped satellites were launched specifically to shoot down any space junk that approaches the Yuri space station. Their accuracy was very good, at 98%. Other satellites were launched to patrol the skies, and shoot down threats to the Empire. Once, the empire spotted a nearby asteroid, and decided to do a little test.... The mile wide asteroid was destroyed.<br />
<br />
**At about the same time, the Empire learned from foreign sources (we rely on info from other nations: we hate embassies, remember?) that the Specialists had plans to attack someone. The Plutonian Empire warned the Specialist what would happen if the they were attacked--the chronoscepters had enough force to knock down the walls surrounding their main island.<br />
<br />
**For the first time, the Empire came into contact with a race known as the &quot;moles.&quot; After becoming friends, the empire realized that they too, could go underground, with modern technology. Immediately, a vast networks of tunnels were created all over the empire. The declining interest in personal computers enabled the Empire to focus more on tunnel building, than to just play civ2 all day long.<br />
<br />
**During a routing science expedition underwater, the empire discovered strange aquatic beings roaming the waters near Scorpi Centauri. Eventually, contact was made. They call themselves &quot;bathosians.&quot; From what the Empire learned, throughout the history of Plutonia (Y214-B), the Bathosians were slowly gaining intelligence, mainly learning from junk falling off of plutonian boats. Eventually, a Bathosian mad scientist managed to neurally implant some stuff into the species, and resulted in their skins having armor-like qualities.<br />
<br />
**The empire also launched their first space probe. Headed directly for Artica, Plutous' outermost planet. It will take a while for the probe to reach Artica. After the launch, it was discovered that the doomsday asteroid was just one of millions of asteroids in a belt between Y214-B and Y214-C.**<br />
<br />
Part 3: Explosive Ice<br />
**The years passed. The world was now noticably cooler. Sea levels have dropped a bit, and the northern ice cap has reappeared. A few years after the northern ice cap reappeared, the southern icecap also returned. Immediately, the Empire took the (southern) ice cap all for themselves. With the return of naturally occuring ice, advances were made into a new field of science: explosive ice. Here again, chemistry takes place, a chemical element that is volatile with water, enters the field, and the ice explodes.<br />
<br />
**One day, the Empire took a wild-card and used explosive ice technology on one of their Death Boats, with one kiloton of explosives...**<br />
<br />
C-C-C-CRRRRACK-K-K-KA-BOOOOOMMMMmmmmmmm.......<br />
<br />
**The explosion released a huge blast of vapor, but not ordinary water vapor, it was vapor of a mixture of water, sodium, and alkaline. Because of the heat generated from the one-kiloton explosion, and the vaporous content, and it being only 60 degrees out, it had an almost immediate effect on the weather. From miles away, one could see a rapidly expanding mushroom cloud. Within half an hour, the cloud grew to slightly resemble a storm cell. Lightning struck the surface once or twice. By the end of the day, Plutonia's first &quot;artificial storm&quot; rained itself out. By the end of the year, the Empire commisioned 100 death boats equipped with explosive ice technology, but it will be years, perhaps decades, before the empire can develop new technology that can get artic blasts from icebombs.&quot;**</div></div><hr />

You'd require some quite out-there technology to generate an explosion that actually takes in energy rather than releasing it.

To you TP, I alowed thigs like &quot;milktricity&quot; because there it's quite possible to react some chemical compound with milk (and all that it contains) to produce energy, your body is doing it right now. The energy released could then be used to generate electricity, hence &quot;Milktricity.&quot; Using the same general concept of artificial metabolizing, (now there's a fancy term, better copyright that...) one could easily use any organic product as a power source. I allow slight and humourous stretching of science, not not to the point of doing something completley impossible. (Like these supposed &quot;Ice bombs&quot;)</div></div><hr />

You must remain impartial though, and upon my return I will be allowed to veto your judgements if I deem them biased. You medal will arrive via PM in 8-10 buisness days. Again, way to go, have a celebratory doughnut.<br />

Stick to breaking up arguments and calming the masses. I'll be the only one dolling out punishments or appointing assitants.<br />
and cold explosions can happen  No they cannot.ice bombs could work and you burn pizzas for steam for piztricity. I already said that.Yuri appointed you as a 'ref', not a god. True, but his judgment is to be obeyed as if it were my oen (unless I state otherwise)<br />
Then the collective stupidity of the civilizations reached a critical point, causing the entire planet to explode and the death of everyone except Perfection and Yuri. Perfection then threw Yuri in a black hole, conjured up some attractive young females and enjoyed a Tuna Sandwich. This, for example, I will overide. I have a far more interesting way to end these people if it comes to that...<br />
<br />
Final verdicts:<br />
1) The planet still exists as it does, but, in the event that you push me too far I will destroy this and begin again with something completley new and different.<br />
2) Icebombs and Pizzapower are acceptable. (but the Ice-bomb is a conventional chemical explosive)<br />

Hopefully it'll be Bathosian Military Commander Fisher's boot, because it has metal SHARP spikes on it! I say we give one of the mods a Ladder membership (that's a net C3C league) to ban Perfection. (I don't like the way that sounded, sorry XIII)<br />
I'll take my turn now, if it makes any of you feel better...<br />
<br />
After several months of building the city of New Bathosia next to several islands,(they can build things under water) the colonists have met every civilization on the planet except for Perfection, who they were told to avoid by everyone they met. Yes, even the mole people. No civ had responded to the laser sale yet, not even Yuri and his space station, even though the price was lowered to 1000 gold. They have set up mines and farms, mostly aquaculture, for Bathosians are very fond of shrimpcakes, pressed patties of shrimp and kelp. They have become rich through trade with the Franch Federation, who say their people love double-deep-frying the shrimpcakes.<br />
Davidizer13: Radar person! Status report!<br />
&quot;Yes my lord. No one seems to be in our borders, not even Franch Federation shrimpcake caravans.&quot;<br />
&quot;It's been like this for several days. Check the open channels for any transmissions.&quot;<br />
&quot;Sir, there have been several distress calls from the caravans in the borders of the Gamma Quadrant road.&quot;<br />
&quot;Alert Fisher and marshall the guard. We have to defend those trucks!&quot;<br />
The Gamma militia rushed to the scene, to find several of Specialist's companies attacking the caravans!<br />
Fisher: What's going on down there!<br />
&quot;It appears that the Specialists are stopping the Franch Federation trade! They despise the Franch Federation. but don't want Franch's allies coming into it!&quot;<br />
&quot;Namely those mole people. Let's get a strike team down there!&quot;<br />
The Bathosians easily wiped out the lightly armed and armored Specialist raiders.<br />
Fisher: Soldiers report!<br />
&quot;Two dead, 15 wounded. I can't count the Specialists, though. The few survivors escaped into the stand of trees there.&quot;<br />
&quot;Artillery fire at those trees!&quot;<br />
The artillery finished the rest of them off, and the troop stationed guards at Tantive Pass, where they attacked.<br />
Davidizer13: I hope you know our actions today place us at war with the Specialists.<br />
Fisher: Yes, sir. I will rally more troops for defense!<br />
If any of this conflicts with your storylines, it's because there have been too few turns!</div></div><hr />
