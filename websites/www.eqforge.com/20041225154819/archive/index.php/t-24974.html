<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TedG</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2002, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know that Windows XP automatically reorganizes files on the HD every few days, so programs will lauch faster.  But I was wondering if this has anything to do with performing a full defrag of the HD on a regular basis. M****soft says it's not a substitute for a full defrag, but I remember someone here saying that defragging on XP actually slows your computer down. Is that actually the case? I frequently do a lot of creating, moving, and deleting of files (mostly large .wav files but lots of other files as well), and I understand that this will increase the rate of HD fragmentation, but does XP's automatic defragmentation take this into account, or is that only for launching programs faster? And will doing a full defrag (using XP's defragger, not a third-party one) undo what the automatic defragging does? In any case, should I defrag or leave it alone?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2002, 01:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good question TedG. I was the one that said defragging XP is not a good idea. AFIAK I got this information from Maximum PC magazine. The person that wrote that article is a MCSE and I would think that he would know his stuff. Let me go over to microsoft.com and see if they have any official information on defragging HDDs with XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2002, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The defrag in XP is pretty adequate.  The slowdown can occur during the Defrag process if you defrag with one defragger, then use another different defragger... this is because there is more than one way to defrag a drive.<br />
<br />
The final result for NT (NT, W2K, and XP) should be about the same, and for most users, the MS Defragger is OK.<br />
<br />
Some 3rd party defraggers are arguable superior to the MS defragger for XP.  For Win 9x OSs (win95, 98, 98SE, ME), 3rd party defraggers are almost all superior.<br />
<br />
The defrag results also depend your file storage system.  For most Win9x, it is FAT32... which is highly susceptable to fragmentation, and very low performance to begin with.   For NT, NTFS is the common alternative.  It is faster (in most cases), and much more secure, and less susceptable to fragmentation.<br />
<br />
Given what you describe, I'd do a full defrag about once a week.  If you see a performance improvement, you might try it more often.  If not, less often.<br />
<br />
Defragging is not essential to keep an OS running; it just improves the speed and efficiency of disk operations.<br />
<br />
Note:  CD Roms cannot be defragged, so don't bother to try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TedG</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2002, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That brings me to another question. I've just been using FAT32 since I installed XP (It was actually an upgrade from that don't-even-get-me-started-on-how-horrible-it-was Windows Millenium Edition, and the installer didn't convert the file system - it just left it as FAT32). I know it's possible to convert the file system to NTFS at any time, but I just never bothered with it. So should I convert it? Will it screw up any of my programs? Is it actually faster? (I heard somewhere it was slower, but I don't remember where I heard that - I think it was on TechTV.) And what are the advantages/disadvantages?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
And no, I never planned on trying to defrag a CD-ROM.:lol:</div></div><hr />

The Limitations of the Disk Defragmenter Tool in Windows XP (Q314848) (http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q314848) &lt;- Click link for more info!<br />
The Disk Defragmenter tool is based on the full retail version of Executive Software Diskeeper. The version that is included with <br />
Windows XP and later products provides limited functionality in maintaining disk performance by defragmenting volumes that use the FAT, FAT32, or NTFS file system. <br />
<br />
Also read from MS that they do encourage defragging....not too sure who to believe!! :crazyeye:<br />
Defragmenting NTFS Volumes  (http://search.microsoft.com/gomsuri.asp?n=3&amp;c=rp_Results&amp;siteid=us&amp;target=http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/prodtechnol/winxppro/reskit/prkc_fil_tzol.asp) &lt;- Click link for more info!<br />
Summary: Defragmenting NTFS Volumes Windows XP Professional provides two methods of defragmenting NTFS volumes: the Disk Defragmenter snap-in and the new defrag command-line tool. You can use either tool as part of a frequent and regular maintenance program to maintain the optimum performance of NTFS</div></div><hr />

NTFS Conversion Issues for FAT Volumes<br />
Before you convert a FAT or FAT32 volume to NTFS, you must consider the following issues:<br />
 You cannot uninstall Windows XP Professional if you convert any volume to NTFS. For more information, see &quot;Supporting Installations&quot; in this book. <br />
 Despite a minimal chance of corruption or data loss during the conversion from FAT to NTFS, it is recommended that you perform a full backup of the data on the volume to be converted before you execute the convert command. It is also recommended that you verify the integrity of the backup before proceeding. <br />
 The conversion is a one-way process. After you convert a volume to NTFS, you cannot reconvert the volume to FAT without backing up your data, reformatting the volume as FAT, and then restoring your data.</div></div><hr />

All that stuff about having to back up makes me want to just leave it alone.:(  With my luck, something would get corrupted during the conversion process, even if it's a &quot;minimal chance.&quot; But I don't want to have to do a full back-up. I have no practical way to back up a 40 gig drive, and although I know backing up everything is not necessary, I don't want to have to spend ages going through my files to choose which ones I really need to keep and which aren't that important. I wish it would have converted it when I upgraded (back then, I didn't have so many programs and stuff on my HD), but that option was not there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2002, 02:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't think you will have a problem. I have converted a few drives and not one problem. Take a chance! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">starlifter</div><div class="date">Jun 16, 2002, 02:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recommend Partition Magic for all format and data conversions.  It is singularly excellent, and IMHO safer than MS methods.<br />
<br />
Normally, Win9x cannot read NTFS, and you may get drive letter shifting if you dual boot, or use LILO, or Boot Magic, or System Commander, etc.  The details of multiple OSs and optimum drive lettering, etc.  fairly long to explain, so if you run any Win9x on your machine, stick with FAT32 for NTx.<br />
<br />
BTW, FAT32 is faster than NTFS under certain conditions and partition sizes.  Do not worry about it if you're a home or SOHO user.</div></div><hr />
