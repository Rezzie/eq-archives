<br />
Can we not get ANY kind of feedback from Firaxis?  So there will be a patch next week?  What will it address?<br />
<br />
Will be interesting to find out, I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VoodooAce</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would llike to add that, if you work for Firaxis, admit to it if you reply here.  <br />
<br />
I'm getting pretty suspicious of some of these guys in here with 2 posts saying we should ease up on poor, poor Firaxis.<br />
<br />
'it's not a show stopper, it's a patch stopper'.   What????  It's a stopper, on a game that's been out a month, has no patch, and NO COMMENT from Firaxis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Geez, it seems as if we are not even allowed to complain anymore since the Firaxis thought police has decided that we are not worthy of dirtying Sid's name by telling people there are bugs in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dan Magaha FIRAXIS</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just for the record, please see<br />
<br />
http://apolyton.net/misc/chat/civ3/civ3ai-1.shtml<br />
<br />
About a week after the game was released we confirmed that we were working on the first patch, and we have been working on it steadily ever since.    Additionally, I've posted in numerous threads (both here and Apolyton) where I knew that an issue was going to be resolved in a patch, and made that clear.<br />
<br />
As for when the patch is going to be finished, Jeff's comment about the patch release was that if all went well the patch could be available as early as next week.  However, it's entirely possible that testing could cause the patch to &quot;reset&quot; (restarted after a fix is made).  <br />
<br />
I can tell you it will be a pretty substantial update, but not much more than that.<br />
<br />
Dan<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S., for the record, I have never (nor has anyone else from Firaxis, AFAIK) made any statements that people don't have the right to complain or voice their opinion on this or any other forum.    <br />
<br />
Of course the game has bugs.  Every major piece of PC software (game or otherwise) in the last decade has shipped with bugs of one sort or another, that's just a fact of modern software development.   You just do your best to address them as quickly and as completely as possible and that is exactly what we are doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not as irate as some about the bugs and limitations of CivIII, but I do wonder about the Firaxian attitude displayed by Dan's response.  Why couldn't he say more than what he did?  Why all the secrecy about what they are working on for the patch?<br />
<br />
You would think they would want their fans (happy and disgruntled, both) to know what's going on.  I would even be satisfied with an explanation as to why it is that they can't disclose any helpful/hopeful information about the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northstar5757</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Give Dan a break, I'm angry just like the rest of you but firaxis is obviously not going to state anything specific as to when the patch will come out and what will be changed.  Plus i could be wrong but I'm guessing Dan isn't a head honcho at firaxis which doesn't afford him the luxury to divulge any information he sees fit.<br />
<br />
It was such deadlines that messed the game up in the first place.  It's obvious to anyone that the sole reason for all these problems is the game was rushed (as someone mentioned earlier certain files were labled under Moo2....)  Take as much time as you need to get the patch out as long as it works.  <br />
<br />
The one thing I'm angry about is that nothing is mentioned at all on their website about the patch, if I didn't know about this board I'd be in the dark.  But I guess it would be very bad press to talk about patches when they are selling tons of copies each day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Franklyn</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe Dan's keeping his mouth shut to delay the inevitable flood of the &quot;why didn't you include THIS in the patch?!?&quot; threads. Besides, his silence gives everyone more time to keep up the &quot;Why won't Firaxis say more?!&quot; rants.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BTW MESSAGE TO FIRAXIS: Although it's not everybody that likes CivIII, I just want to say that I really appreciate it. It's my first game from the Civilization series, and not my last if others come on the market. Thanks for making this great game. I am looking forward to that patch, but PLEASE, PLEASE give us the possibility to create good scenarios (writing events, place units/cities). <br />
<br />
Just wanted to say how much I like CivIII to the creators:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a thought, they're all keeping quiet because they're busying playing the game with the new patch, instead of answering to all the wining.  :lol:  At least that is more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VoodooAce</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, now i'm lmao.<br />
<br />
Leave poor, poor ol' Firaxis alone.  :cry: :cry: :cry: <br />
<br />
Godot said it best.   <br />
<br />
Then again, I dunno.  I don't have a top-secret clearance or anything, so why should Firaxis bother with me.<br />
<br />
Northstar, we all realize Dan ain't the CEO at Firaxis, and probably does what his boss says to do.<br />
<br />
I'm not bitter with him, I'm bitter with Firaxis, more so now with the lame answer seen above.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Vinc, Firaxis probably has more than three employees.  I think it's well within the realm of possibility that they could fix the damn game AND tell us their fixing the damn game.<br />
<br />
I wish there were a smiley-face icon for kissing @$$!!!!!!!  <br />
<br />
They ain't gonna send you a free game for a little peck on the ass, lol<br />
<br />
I'll take the constructive criticism over the blatant ass kissing anyday....</div></div><hr />

I would even be satisfied with an explanation as to why it is that they can't disclose any helpful/hopeful information about the patch. <br />
<br />
Well, for starters, because at any given time during the patch development and testing process, a bugfix may need to be removed because it has introduced new bugs that can't easily be resolved.   <br />
<br />
Therefore, we are not releasing any lists of fixes and feature enhancements until the patch has passed testing and has been signed off.    <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dannyevilcat</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My lord, people... Why are you SO FREAKIN' UPSET?!! Before you hurry to reply and lambaste me for being a Sid groupie, hold up! Look, I've logged more Civ 2 time than any human being probably should have, although I'm relatively new in this forum, and yes I'm such a freak that I actually left work for a few hours to pick up Civ3 from the Electronics Boutique a mere two hours after I got the call it was in. Yes, I suck THAT much, but what can I say... Civ rocks.<br />
<br />
But I've played the game ALOT, and I'm still having a blast, bugs or not. Am I kissing Sid's a**? No!!!!! I mean, damn, complaining at such volume must be exhausting!<br />
<br />
And guess what... the patch IS coming, so why not just wait for it instead of demanding a 24 hour around the clock status report from Firaxis? Must you know everything about everything? Christmas is a month away... I'll bet you know everything you're getting, don't you?<br />
<br />
Take a valium. But before you do... Let me brace myself for all the violent replies of disgruntled Civ fans. IT'S A GAME, AND A GOOD ONE! &quot;Ahhhhh--not the face! Nooo-Naahhh!! It hurts...!&quot;</div></div><hr />

As Dan stated, in process of developing software it sometimes necessary to change or entirely remove features which were planned or implemented in the beginning.  Ultima Online is constantly releasing patches for their game and in the past had made a habit of promising or eluding to certain changes which never came to be.  This did nothing but infuriate the player community.  I'm just glad Firaxis announced they are working on the patch and gave a tenative release date.  That's a lot better some other companies have done *cough* Origin *cough*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jc011</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I agree, they are not making any promises so there can be no dissapointments if it is not kept.  I think they are doing a wise choice.  We should just sit tight and be patient and wait a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Craterus22</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the main point that people are making is that Firaxis has not provided any information on thier own website concerning a patch OR bugs.<br />
<br />
An example that I suggested to dan was that the company should consider having a page listing all the bugs that they are aware of in the game.<br />
<br />
This would save  posters on this forum and people who send in e-mails to the company from collectively writing up detailed descriptions of the same bugs over and over again. <br />
<br />
This would be a time saver both them and us (assuming of course that they read thier e-mail).  I would have thought that after they read about air support for the 500th time they would want to list out the bugs they were aware of...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mike C</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 11:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am beginning to see yet another round of feet kissing after Dan has posted what skimpy information he is &quot;allowed&quot; to tell us.  People spewing out crap that we should be more &quot;appreciative&quot; or &quot;supportive&quot;<br />
<br />
1)  We shouldn't be appreciative of anything.  WE PAID MONEY FOR A PRODUCT THAT WASN'T FUNCTIONING AS ADVERTISED.  No ifs, ands, or buts.<br />
<br />
2)  It is quite obvious that the airsuperiority bug, my biggest gripe especially in light of the fact it wasn't patched promptly, was a result of LACK OF TESTING.  Yes, bugs are an unfortunate way of life in the computing industry.  Hell, even I know nothing is bug free, but the rate of failure of this product is UNACCEPTABLE.  If I was to program a application that I promised a client would display a set of results and didn't, guess what?  I would get fired.  I wouldn't get fired if I told them there were bugs that needed to be worked out and if they chose to go ahead with deploying the software with the limitations then fine.  BUT ALTEAST I TELL THEM AND NOT GIVE THEM THE COLD SHOULDER OF KNOWN ISSUES.  Firaxis has done none of those.<br />
<br />
3)  I would find it a lot easier to swallow if Firaxis would update their friggin website once in a while with a known bug list and update it once in a while on what has been fixed, even if the bug patch doesn't come out for another 2 weeks.  IT IS ABOUT KEEPING YOUR CUSTOMERS/CLIENTS IN THE LOOP.  I am not asking about updated features or features I didn't like and such.  I am asking about the state of airsuperiority and precision bombing and etc.<br />
<br />
4)  It is not merely &quot;a game&quot; as some idiot suggested.  This is a product we PAID MONEY FOR.  It is not some freeware I downloaded off the web nor was it a game of pickup hockey where I played with a bunch of idiots.  In both those cases, I wasted time.  Here I WASTED MONEY.  Hell, how would you feel if the cable TV cut out on you and when you phoned the company, they told you to chill out, it would get fixed in a week and that it was JUST CABLE TV? <br />
<br />
Bottom line, Firaxis has done a crappy job of keeping customers AND I STRESS customers informed of the progress of the patch and known issues.  I am not expecting a 24 hour bug fix list.  What I AM EXPECTING is once every week or even every 2 weeks they tell us, &quot;We are working on this&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am also not placing the blame soley on Firaxis's feet.  I also blame Infogrames for putting pressure on shoving the product out the door.  Why don't they have a representative here?  Why is Firaxis getting hung out to dry when there are indications that it was Infogrames that pushed the game out the door?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bugg</div><div class="date">Nov 28, 2001, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mike C all this game promises is&quot;that the Software is free from substantial errors or defects that will materially interfere with the operation of the Software as described in the Documentation.&quot; If you feel this game has substantial errors you have a 90 day warranty, which will allow you to get your money back.<br />
As to keeping people in the loop, there was a chat that was publicized that discussed what they were trying to fix with the patch. If you read the transcripts then you knew that the patch was supposed to be released at the end of November.<br />
As to making a list of known bugs, we all know why they aren't doing that . If they made a list of all the bugs they know about and post it, you guys will flame them if it is not in the patch. They listed it but they didn't correct it. Whine Whine Whine.<br />
As to the timeliness of the patch I hear complaints that other companies fix their bugs quicker. Maybe that is true but How big is this game? Don't we need about 500 MB free hard drive space. That's right we do, so this game is larger than most. I didn't say the largest. So I would expect it to take longer.<br />
As to the air superiority you are assuming that they didn't know about it, due to a lack of testing. This was a feature that we didn't have in Civ II, so maybe they just couldn't get it to work in time. <br />
My last point. Most web sites are used for advertising and promotion. They are supposed to contain positive messages. When the patch is ready I'm sure it will say something like &quot;Good news civ lovers a new Civilization III update is available, download here. Isn't that what Microsoft does?</div></div><hr />

Right on the mark!!:shotgun: <br />
<br />
I have been playing Ultima Online (And still am after 4 years :D ) and I couldn't agree better with you here.  My only hope is that Firaxis' patch is hard coded into the exe files and give us a better editor.  I did hate to start making tweaks into the mod file again if they decide to give us a new mod file.:o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slothman</div><div class="date">Nov 28, 2001, 03:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basically, I paid money for a game that I can and want to play. Whether or not I can return it, the game is currently unplayable. For me at least, the showstoppers of sudden disorder and too much corruption. I couldn't even play until the modern age to test the air superiority bug. They should something more than just tell us &quot;Please wait. A patch will come soon.&quot; A list of known bugs, bugs which will be fixed in the patch, or at least a small patch to fix some bugs. I am also assuming that all patches, except maybe multiplayer since that could be a different game, will be downloadable and not cost anything. Also sometimes a patch that fixes some bugs but creates more might be reasonable, but that is debatable They shouldn't have even released a game with showstoppers, both preventing the game from being played at all and from allowing it to be fun. It doesn't really matter if it Infogrames or Firaxis's fault. The game still has bugs. I have decided to give them a deadline of Christmas for a patch that will fix everything I require or I will not buy from either company again. I personally hope they will be fixed soon. The game could be good but right now it's unplayable for me.</div></div><hr />

Look MikeC, it's fine... you aren't getting what you want for your money and you ain't the only one apparently, but when you DO get the patch, is all this huffing and puffing really going to make you feel like you've accomplished something?

<br />
Get Over It!  Whilst I am annoyed at some aspects, I can live with it!  I had to read threads from Americans about how great the game was whilst I waited for it to reach England.<br />
<br />
The patch will be here eventually.  Patience is a virtue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still, then there will be the inevitable &quot;why didn't they include this&quot; threads.<br />

I saw one particularly appalling thing: &quot;I want the editor to allow me to do anything I want.  If I want to turn the manhattin project into a small wonder, I can.  If I want to build a new improvement to reduce culture flips I can&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Indeed.  Maybe they would like the editor to let you turn the game into a first-person-shooter, or flight simulator as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ainwood: Is this a direct quote? I said something like allowing small wonders do things like large and so forth, so you probably disagree with me. I'm just wondering why you don't want the editor to do certain things. Yes civ isn't a FPS but it would seem that more modifying would be better. Appearently not in the first patch. But it would be good at sometime.<br />
<br />
P.S. Most of us, me at least, want the patch to fix bugs that are known to exist. So a patch would definately be for the better. Unless I just misinterpreted your post about not wanting a patch soon.</div></div><hr />

What's wrong with criticism and a little kick ass to get things going around here. Some of us like the game the way it is, that's great. Others want the game to be better than it is, who has a problem about that? <br />
We all like to sound off our opinions about things, but its simply not fair to judge others' lament just because you don't feel the need for it. <br />
<br />
The problem is there, and any less of that recognition would be a lie to one's own conscience. <br />
If we could all tell truth as the way they are, objectively, things would be better off.</div></div><hr />

The company*is* putting out a patch, after all. And I suspect the rants on this site and others will result in a patch that will satisfy most civvers. Then again, some people won't ever be satisfied ... <br />
<br />
As an aside, isn't the regular Civ 2 version something like Civ 2.42 (sorry, don't have my disk handy). Unless Civ2 was released at version 2.40, that means the game has had a bunch of patches (or attempted patches) slapped on it since release. So there's precedent, although most people here would consider Civ2 nothing short of perfect.</div></div><hr />

Folks, you've got to give Firaxis some credit. The company*is* putting out a patch, after all. And I suspect the rants on this site and others will result in a patch that will satisfy most civvers. Then again, some people won't ever be satisfied ... <br />
<br />
<br />
I fail to see why credit should be given.  Software is supposed to work as advertised.  Civ 3 isn't.  Therefore a patch is mandatory and is to be expected.  I repeat MANDATORY AND IS TO BE EXPECTED.  The fact that they are taking their sweet time with it pisses me off.  It wouldn't be half as bad if they had released a patch to take care of critical issues immediatly and then took their sweet time with the extra &quot;enhancements&quot;.<br />
<br />
If you want to know how a company gets credit.  Take a look at Blizzard.  Their products are 99% bug free.  The bugs that do exist can be potential showstopping crash bugs.  More often than not they aren't.  The important thing here is that Blizzard products do not have flagrant bugs like Air superiority.  It is obvious from their games at release state (which are all playble out of the box) that the product is thouroughly tested and goes gold when it hits an acceptable error rate.  And it is continously tested even as the game goes gold and gets shipped.  As a result, 2 weeks of furthur testing has gone by before the game even hits the shelf.  The result is a bug patch within a week of release.  Furthur more, the company continues to support the product many many months down the road with additional balancing patches, cheat bug patches, additional maps and additional interface features.  Now THAT deserves credit.</div></div><hr />

The problem is there, and any less of that recognition would be a lie to one's own conscience. <br />
If we could all tell truth as the way they are, objectively, things would be better off. <br />
<br />
YES! THere are definite and obvious bugs in this horrible game!<br />
WHy are people trying to hide that, and at the same time give in to the carelessness Firaxis's DAN is showing to His customers?!<br />
<br />
We need to stand up and take on the injustice served to us by the self-righteous corporation! Knowing for a fact that without us, they would never have been as big as they are.<br />
<br />
How Dare they!!! GIVE US THE PATCH without further delays or We shall never touch a Firaxis or Sid made product ever again, so help me GOD!<br />
<br />
You first Lie to us, then Deny us the information needed, and now Make Us feel guilty for asking something that Should have been Ours in the First place?!?<br />

Well, for starters, because at any given time during the patch development and testing process, a bugfix may need to be removed because it has introduced new bugs that can't easily be resolved.   <br />
<br />
Therefore, we are not releasing any lists of fixes and feature enhancements until the patch has passed testing and has been signed off.    <br />
<br />
Dan <br />
<br />
Dan, (If you see this message...)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response.  I kinda thought that would be the reason (I'm a SW developer as well).  I know you guys are in a no-win situation with this issue.  For myself, I really don't care if the list of fixes changes, I'd just like to know what is in the hopper to soothe the childish can't-wait-for-Christmas side of my personality. <br />
<br />
To everyone else,<br />
<br />
Please don't call me a Firaxis kiss-ass, but it IS just a game!  I realize it is disappointing to find bugs in new software and not have things work to the level of your expectations (game-play-wise and bug-fix-speed-wise), but since the entire situation is out of our hands (unless you want to return the game for a refund) we might as well be accepting of the situation.  Man, do I sound like a spokesman for a 12-step program or what:D <br />
<br />
Anyway, railing against things out of our control is a great American past-time and I do it too (even in this case), so don't believe I'm being holier-than-thou, just trying to be a calming voice amid the riotous din of enraged Civ junkies :).  (This board really needs a smiley for &quot;tongue in cheek&quot;, but what should it be?)</div></div><hr />

My God, people.  Why are you so thin skinned?  Why are you worrying so much about other people's complaints/criticisms.  <br />
<br />
I get the feeling you want us all to shut up for fear we may piss off the mighty Firaxis gods and they'll never allow us the pleasure of giving them our money agaiin!  <br />
<br />
You are the ones that need to chill out.....start your own threads so you can all kiss Firaxis' feet, ass and other assorted, er, parts together in one mass orgy.<br />
<br />
I like my game!  I love it!  I just wish I could play it through to the end.  YEAH, OK!!  I know someone out there is getting ready to telll me, &quot;I play it all the way through and I just LOVE it!&quot;<br />
<br />
That's fine.  Play through to the end if you want.  Personally, I'm saving my games until the game functions properly.<br />
<br />
And, since I did shell out my $50, the product is inferior, and I live in a Democratic society, I AM going to complain.  <br />
<br />
Now, Dan's most recent answer is better than ANYTHING else I've seen in response to the tons of questiosn so many of us have.  Not much there, but it's better than anything thus far.   <br />
<br />
All we want is to be lead out of the Darkness!</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, so I did. For a company that puts out 99% bug-free products, there sure are a lot of patches for Diablo II. The number of bugs listed on Blizzard's online site are simply staggering. <br />
<br />
And according to Gamespot, the most recent patch (version 1.09) came out in August -- 14 months after the game went gold. <br />
<br />
You wanna give Blizzard credit? Be my guest ...</div></div><hr />

Name one bug that comes anywhere close to the blunder made by Firaxis on their Air Superiority issue at any time after the game's release.  Take a look at how many patches are delt out to simply give players balancing patches for various skills to make the game just that tad more fair.  Sure there are a lot of crazy bugs they fix.  But the fact is that the game is playable out of the box (unlike Civ 3).  No features are broken out of the box.<br />
<br />
Face it, the stuff blizzard fixes is the stuff like the Civ 3 bombard bug where you can bombard anywhere on the planet so long as you click enough times.<br />
<br />
You cannot find an equivilant bug of the magnitude of Air Superiority on any of Blizzards products.  Thats a fact.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: In fact, to help you out on your quest, I'll even post the bug patch list.<br />
<br />
http://www.blizzard.com/support/information/d2patch.shtml<br />
<br />
When blizzard has to call &quot;Fixed a hang bug that could occur if picking up gold while fleeing from a Gargantuan Beast (Act I). &quot; a major bug, the code has got to be pretty tight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a hard time thinking it was JUST Infogrames pushing the product out the door as the fans beating at the door to get it ASAP.  I know I was hyped.  Hell, if you were them..wouldn't you try to step things up?  Before this game was released...everyone who loved the past ones were excited..more so than any other game I have ever known.  Strike while the iron is hot...that is what I would do.<br />
<br />
I have not had any major problems with the game.  I have had it crash a couple of times and so forth...but nothin I haven't seen before with other games.  This game is fun and playable.  I am enjoying now with the bugs..it will be great when those bugs are gone..but...I am still playing a ton.<br />
<br />
Everybody is totally entitled to their opinion.  Please lighten up a bit.  THis game is awesome...and it will get better...just have fun until then.  My sympathies to those whose machines' hardware/software is the problem and it cannot run or something.   I am looking forward to the patch..but I have plenty to do until it comes.  Like trying to smoke those evil French pinko bastiches off my feaking continent.</div></div><hr />

I'm not completely unsympathetic to your point, MikeC. I've played and owned enough PC games to know that they'll ship with bugs, some bigger than others (and some more manageable than others depending on your gameplay style) and most of them fixed eventually.<br />
<br />
To put this debate into context, consider the Civ2 airbase issue. I'm sure Sid &amp; Co. didn't intend for airbases to become superfarms.

Soren Johnson :spank: of Firaxis basicaly said,<br />
<br />
&quot;I cant say anything about the patch, except corruption wont be any worse than it already is.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now if you call that piss poor explination :rocket: about the patch sufficient, then pucker up cause I am sure Firaxis has alot more butt for the kissin.<br />
<br />
Kinda like that cable example made before, if you called up and asked when is it going to be fixed and they said, &quot;Well, we arent going to make it any worse.&quot; I am sure you wouldnt be very happy :suicide:. If this were a car, it would have been recalled.<br />
<br />
As for blizzard and their posted bugs, at least they have the BALLS to post their buggs. I dont see ANYONE here commenting about BUGS. I hear alot of people accepting compliments and being EXTREMELY vauge as to when they are going to &quot;signifigantly&quot; FIX their half assed product.<br />
<br />
I can tell you this Firaxis. If you wanna see what happens when you do stuff like this, take a look at the sales for EnterPlays &quot;Orion Pirates&quot; (take off of Empires At War). The game flopped because people would not buy it because of ALL the bugs released with Empires At War. If you keep this up, I wouldnt even &quot;dream&quot; of releasing Civ IV.<br />
<br />
In my opionion, Civ III was in beta since its release Nov 1. Why do you say this? Since I work on software I can explain the process a little.<br />
<br />
Alpha - Inception and design of software. Testing is done amongst a tight group of people and then reworked until it is &quot;stable&quot;.<br />
<br />
Beta - Software is no longer in its inception and CONCEPTS are all worked out and incorporated by the end of ALPHA. All you need to do now is work out the bugs and maybe regear some code mechanics that may have been written illogicaly, and rear their head under un though of circumstances.<br />
<br />
Production - Software is released as best it can be. Bugs are documented and fixed prior to release. Only things that are fixed are the few that were missed during testing.<br />
<br />
<br />
What it sounds like to me is that the last month they used to find the bugs and gather lists off their consumers :mad:. They are going to make some MAJOR changes :confused: ... this is stuff that only happens in Beta testing, not after production. Why? Because documentation SHOULD be complete and reflect the &quot;ideal&quot; functionality of the post beta product.<br />
<br />
What happens if they make MAJOR changes? Take your very EXPENSIVE :eek: manuals (Manuals are what makes the games expensive, along with the box), and burn'em.<br />

Good Job :goodjob: :vomit: Firaxis!<br />

<br />
I have never once had any characters deleted on any version of the patch.  I have never once encountered any of the bugs that were on the bug list.  Neither have a lot of other Diablo 2 players as there was no time where there were people flaming the boards on technical issues.<br />
<br />
However, I can safely say, EVERYONE who has played Civ 3 has experienced the Air Superority bug.  Because it is well documented and is a fact that the feature does not work under ANY conditions.<br />
<br />
Furthur more, I cannot find the bug you mentioned on their official bug list or fixed list.  According to Gamespot, there were no significant bugs with Civ 3 either.  Go figure.<br />

WHY DO YOU ACCEPT IT?!  Would you accept a contractor building you a house with a roof that doesn't keep water out?  Would you buy a TV that doesn't allow you to control the volume?  Would you buy a car that doesn't let you shift into reverse?  Would you subscribe to an internet service if they didn't allow you to surf the web?  Furthur more would you accept any of those situations and sit there saying &quot;most of them fixed eventually&quot;?!<br />
<br />
Do you know why your roof doesn't leak at night or your TV has working volume or your car has a working reverse?  Because consumers are not willing to tolerate that kind of crap.  The only reason why we continue to get major bugs in software is because CONSUMERS LIKE YOU for some mysterious reason seems to think this is status quo and everyone should be happy with their lot.<br />

They are also willing to can their own products after 2 years dev. and say they did it because it sucked instead of tossing it out on to the self regardless.  Find me another company that was this deep in the dev. cycle and was willing to can it.<br />
<br />
WarCraft Adventures would have sold simply based on the fact it would have had Blizzard's name on it.  But guess what?  It sucked, and Blizzard management had the decency to cancel it.  That move gained it more respect from me than anything else they have done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
first of all, you shouldn't even compare &quot;Sid&amp;Co&quot; to Blizzard Entertainment. They are two birds of different feathers, one is a cheap sh*t that doesn't take care of their own customers and the other DOES take care of customers and act professionally.<br />
Yes I love Blizzard, and I'm not ashamed to be a kiss-ass, but only for them ;)<br />
<br />
You talk about Diablo2, and try to compare it to Civ3 in terms of bugs... okay lets compare:<br />
<br />
game:<br />
D2- out of the box, you could finish the game and explore every aspect of the game.<br />
Civ3- bugs:air superiority , corruption unbalance, culture flips, and a bunch more you could find just by skimming at these forums.<br />
<br />
forums:<br />
D2- d2.net, a great place to meet other players and chat about pvp, item qualities, monster drops, character development. And something which could count as a &quot;bug&quot; in the conceptual sense: &quot;compared to others Sorcy's firewall is too strong. &quot;<br />
<br />
Civ3- Now, unless you're blind, half of all posts after the release of Civ3 has been about bugs, and the unbalance of game concepts. <br />
<br />
patches:<br />
<br />
D2- from my personal experience, I do not recall Blizzard posting names of certain bugs before releasing a patch for it. Usually, they are done mysteriously, and things are taken cared off before people notice them.<br />
<br />
But then again, I never experienced any bugs and Yes I'd know if there was since I visit the only place where information flows -- the forums.  <br />
<br />
Civ3: &quot;Wheres the patch?&quot; &quot;Hey, know when the patch's coming out?&quot; &quot;What will the patch do?&quot;................................... <br />
<br />
result: <br />
<br />
I don't feel the need to bash Civ3 and the &quot;great&quot; Sid on the account of Blizzard. They don't measure up even close to Blizzard for those two to fit in the same category.<br />
(dont burn my house fanboys)<br />
<br />
btw, to the idiot who tried to shield Civ3 by saying something about D2 patches: obviously you know nothing about D2. <br />
Those patches are for balancing elements of the game, i.e skills, money, monster loot, monster difficulty, pvp, for BATTLE.Net only! You don't even need those patches if you're just a single player type of guy. The game could be played from start to end using version 1.00!<br />
<br />
All this talk is not without actual leading evidence either. <br />
Those that remember, long ago, when Civ3 was still under its developmental phrase, some guy asked Firaxis whether they will be offering beta testing. ANd the response he got was: &quot;we'll be doing our own closed testing.&quot; <br />
...<br />
<br />
Apparently, that was not the case. Since we, as customers, are performing their &quot;beta&quot; testing right now. It's really no different. <br />
They left out an entire phrase of production, and are using us to support them with notable bugs.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, for all of you who want prove something by comparing a great, responsible company who at least test their freakin product to Sid Meier: Go play some more Civ!<br />
Thats the best cure for ya!<br />
:) :) :) :) :)<br />
<br />
edit: haha, ironfang, great minds think alike. I just read your post and noticed we both mentioned their evil strategy for beta testing. ;)</div></div><hr />

Of course not, but those are ridiculous analogies. As far as I can tell, people can still play Civ3. I can't believe the air superiority issue is as integral to the game as you make it out to be. Otherwise, there wouldn't be all these threads from folks bragging about how they've won Civ3. It might be a pain-in-the-butt bug, but it's certainly not fatal. <br />
<br />
By the way, on the planet I live on, things get recalled all the time -- cars, toys, consumer products, etc. At least Firaxis' mistakes won't kill you, unlike those made by, say, Ford and Firestone.</div></div><hr />

thanks for the compliment. back at 'cha.<br />
<br />
obviously, no one's hearts or minds will be changed at this rate, so let's change direction of this debate:<br />
<br />
Nearly every PC game (except those put out by the infallible Blizzard, their long list of major and minor bugs notwithstanding)are buggy to some degree. In my years of playing PC games (they date back to some sort of RPG on an old Tandy), I can't recall any that haven't needed some sort of tweaking.<br />
<br />
So ... if you're so concerned about bugs, why would you plunk down 50 clams for a PC game as soon as it comes out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bugs, I only know too well for them to be a part of reality. But, what concerns me and most of everyone who knows something's wrong, is the degree of responsiblity taken by Civ's game makers.<br />
Nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Franklyn</div><div class="date">Nov 28, 2001, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good point, but I don't think Firaxis (or any other company, for that matter) is going to come out and say, &quot;This product sucks -- don't buy it.&quot;<br />
Firaxis has been candid here and at Apolyton about saying they'll put out a patch. They'd do themselves a world of PR good if they'd say when the patch is coming and what might be on it. <br />
Of course, any announcement would launch a string of why-didn't-they-put-THIS-on-the-patch threads, and MikeC &amp; I would be right back where we started with this debate. :crazyeyes</div></div><hr />

Yes you did, but that &quot;request&quot; was directed toward those who are Firaxis employees or those who want to kiss various parts of their anatomy.  I don't fit into either category.<br />
<br />
However, it saddens me to see so many people get so angry and vitriolic toward other posters and Firaxis over this issue.  The degree of passion being expended seems all out of proportion.  Civ3 is not necessary to pay the rent/mortgage or keep a family fed or help strengthen the sense of community among individuals.  It is a game, a diversion, an amusement.  I think the flaws in the game should be treated as such and not as an abridgement of your civil liberties.  <br />
<br />
Finally, I'm sorry I trespassed where my opinion is unwelcome.  My goal was not to fan the flames of passionate anger, but simply to interject counterpoint and a lighter tone to, what I thought was, an open discussion.  I will now leave this stage to you VoodooAce.</div></div><hr />

I'd react with a lot more indignation if it were my civil liberties at stake. The point being, with all the complaints, has something to do with fighting for one's rights. That's what the free countries are all about, is it not? For one thing, its not about taking it up the ass, regardless how others feel. <br />
<br />
You're right to say it is a game.  <br />
You're wrong to think a game with significant bugs can be an amusement.</div></div><hr />

This being said, as soon as I get the board on my home pc fixxed and have an extra $40 (I think that I the lowest I have seen it selling for) I will buy Civ 3, patch or not.  I might complain, rant, and rave after that time but I will/would still buy it.<br />
<br />
I do have to say that my computer being busted has been a blessing in certain ways,  If it had want out a few weeks later I would have spent $50 on the game and been upset at the bugs.  now I will spent $40 (maybe less) and know what i am getting when I do buy it.</div></div><hr />

Oh tell me glorius Dan, how far was Dino in the dev cycle?  Or was it just something that never got past the pre-beta stage and Sid decided that it wasn't worth his time anymore?<br />
<br />
I also doubt Dino would have made 1/5 of the sales WC: Adventures would have done, regardless of quality.<br />
<br />
Now how about you give us some REAL information.  While looking for those aritcles you could have ohhh let me see, compile the list of known bugs that Firaxis knows about and post them on the Civ 3.com site?<br />
<br />
No, no, that would be against the Sid edict of treating their customers like trash. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can figure out why they cant say what they are releaseing as far as bugs, because they just dont know. We are all assuming that the folks in Firaxis know all the bugs, or even know where to begin to fix them. At this rate with all this time having passed, I have a feeling that its going to become &quot;Patch Soup&quot;. They will release one big patch because of all the pressure, and then continue to stream out patch after patch to fix the mess ups from the first patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
To Dan:<br />
<br />
On the other hand, answering the really childish questions and ignoring the truly pressing questions is not only unprofessional but truly lame (for lack of a better word). No one has answered what 95% of the consumers have asked for:<br />
<br />
		WHAT IS BEING FIXED?<br />
	WHAT DO YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AS BEING BROKE?<br />
	WHAT IS THE PLAN FOR FIXING KNOWN BUGS?<br />
<br />
 Yes, we understand that there will be a patch. We understand that it has a slim possibility of being out next week, and we all know that it will fix &quot;something&quot; and all the fixes will be listed in a README.txt. <br />
<br />
Yes, I read Soren Johnsons interview. No it didnt list any of the above questions.<br />

( and I was a beta tester, I thought ) How would you like to spend hundreds of hours getting a charactor up in levels only to have it nerfed to the point of being useless? Server side patches: no one knows yet what they do, how many there are, but there is a bunch and they come out totaly unannounced , most tmes. Don't like an aspect of the game? Wait sec they'll change it. And how about that 1.08 patch? My God what a mess. They did more patches to fix their patch then anything I've ever seen. This outfit has changed more stuff in a game then any other I've ever played and I have no idea how much time I've spent on the slow ass Bnet servers. How friggin long has Bnet been going now? Long time and they still can't get it right. Tip of the iceberg, I could go on for hours about this group. Now having bashed Blizz, they do come out with some kickass games, but never again will I buy blindly, just because it has the Blizzard logo. The addon cost me 35 bucks bringing the total for the game to about 85 dollars US. It was clear to me from the start that D2 was rushed and the friggin addon should have been in the first part. Milk me Blizz, milk me cause I'm made of money. NOT.<br />
<br />
Civ3 has some bug problems, they'll be fixed. We may see the play balanced tweaked. We may see more added. The game still has that &quot;one more turn, oh my God!! it's time to get up&quot;.<br />
<br />
I really think there is a comparison that can be made between Civ3 and D2. When LOD (the addon) came out the howls went up from all over. They couldn't walk through hell difficulty armed with only a stick and beat everything anymore. The game had changed, it was harder. Much the same can be said between Civ2 and Civ3. You need do things different. Think people, think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think saying they treat their customers like trash is hooey.<br />
<br />
Maybe, on this game, things have not gone smoothly.  Guess what? Everybody is entitled to make mistakes.  Have you had tons of problems with their other games (SMAC, Antietam-Firaxis;CivI&amp;II,Colonization,Pirates-Sid/Microprose)?  I sure didn't.  Mabye, others had different experiences with those products than me.  But, if you did have a problem...then why did you go buy Civ3 if Firaxis (&amp; Sid) had such a horrible track record.  Why?..cause they do NOT...just a guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zannhart</div><div class="date">Nov 30, 2001, 12:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gah you people are driving me crazy!  And I mean the damn butt-kissers out there! (Trying not to cuss although it's damn hard.)<br />
<br />
I work for AT&amp;T and when I get a phone call people almost instantly are cussing me out for their damn long distance not working.  Or there'll call be complaining it's been two, count them TWO hours since they reported their long distance not working, and it's STILL not working.<br />
<br />
Guess what, I had NOTHING to do with building the damn phone system and I DIDN'T break their long distance.  But do I sit there and say &quot;Hey, look, I don't care if you're paying for this per month, and I don't care if when you signed up you were under the assumption you could make a long distance phone call anytime you want, all I do know is we'll fix it in a month or two.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hell no!  I'd get fired on the spot for doing something so utterly stupid and treating customers like that.<br />
<br />
There are several major differences here, Firaxis DID make this game, they ARE the reason major parts of the game aren't working, and all they have to do is take critisim on a stupid forum which if they really wanted to they could just ignore.<br />
<br />
I have to sit there and have people yell at me on the phone!  Calling me stupid, cussing at me, and all sorts of lovely stuff!  I don't have a choice, if I don't I get fired.<br />
<br />
Do I think people should bad mouth Firaxis so much?  No, I don't.  Mostly because I know how it feels to be on that side of the fence and I hate putting people through that.<br />
<br />
Do I think people should stop bad mouthing Firaxis?  No.  Reason?  If people didn't call me to inform me their long distance isn't working it would never get fixed.  Sure people could politly point out the flaws in the game, and I think they should start there.  But come on, the game has been out almost a month, you must understand people are going to get upset.<br />
<br />
If you didn't get paid for a month wouldn't you be upset?  Yes, I know this isn't quite the samething but it's the same concept.  You wouldn't go up to your boss and say &quot;Hey, you know, I haven't been paid in a month, when do you think I'll see a paycheck?&quot;  Then thank him when he says another month.<br />
<br />
People are entitled to get upset when a product they pay for isn't working the was it was advertised (And yes, it was advertised Air Superority would work, which it doesn't.)<br />
<br />

PS Sorry for being so grumpy, I was just informed today I would be laid off in a couple of months here ::shrugs::</div></div><hr />

It's obvious nothing is going to change from this two sided argument.<br />
<br />
So just drop it.<br />
<br />
For anyone who dislikes Sid, Firaxis, Dan, and Jeff, then watch it before buying any of their product.<br />
<br />
For the rest who are satisfied with their merchandise, I'm glad, and remember to buy more next time.</div></div><hr />
