 I took it to mean thta that uniti could fire twice in one turn. <br />
 I have a newly upgraded artillery in my city Nuremberg, and it is under attack my roman forces. It is in the city with 2 cavarly. I have tried three times to bombard with artillery and everytime the same thing happens. I get to shoot once (within my 2-square range) and then it's turn is over. Don;t I get to fire my artilley twice? or maybe it shoots two shots at the one target i specofy? does anyone have any knowledge about this?<br />
 I hope I will be able to shoot twice in one turn (@ diff targets)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only time a unit can shoot/attack more than once is when a unit has the blizt capability checked in the rules file.  Currently only Panzer and Modern Armor has that ability in the original mod file.  By blizt, it means the unit get to attack 3 times if it has 3 movement points (if it didn't die in the first few attempt :D )</div></div><hr />
