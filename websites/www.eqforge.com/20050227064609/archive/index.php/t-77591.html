I figured that might be it.:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Feb 04, 2004, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does seem that way.<br />
<br />
We have, what? 3 or 4 people that seem willing to put actual effort into the game?  We can't start a game with that level of participation and hope it gets played out to the end. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Feb 04, 2004, 01:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When did this one start? How long time did it take? If I recall correctly we were playing on this game last summer. Depending on what happens after gymnasium, I might not be able to participate in a few months if we decide on a new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Feb 04, 2004, 01:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We started planning it and such in Feb 2003.  Playing around March 2003.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raiderbob</div><div class="date">Feb 05, 2004, 10:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i'd play instead of just watching... however: i'm just a rookie, and wouldn't want to screw up the group's chances...<br />
<br />
by the time i'd got done moving... and got back to the last game... i was lost...<br />
<br />
i've had civ3 for months, that i haven't even unwrapped yet...<br />
<br />
so if you need a warm body and a built-in handicap...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Feb 13, 2004, 06:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will this forum be archived, and is it final that there'll be no more demo games?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Feb 17, 2004, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm still trying to find the time to post a News Story for this game ending. :(<br />
<br />
I don't see how we can play another game and expect it to be played to any sort of conclusion; there just aren't enough people participating to carry it.<br />
<br />
Yes, once we are all said and done with the game, it will be archived (in the somewhat distant future).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2004, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, then, here's to the end of an age.  Sadly, I don't see much potential for another game.<br />
<br />
Cheers, to the many people that have participated in all the Civ2 Democracy Games at CFC and made it the magnificent legend it is, the first in a long great line of democracy games played by hundreds, if not thousands, of civvers around the world!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">raiderbob</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2004, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like a microcosm of world “politics”. I was a new b at the start of this last demo. Although it was not only enjoyable to watch, it was informative as well. So much so that I knew my limitations. However I tentatively tried to offer help in several ways, but was ignored. So be it.  Perhaps its inherent weakness is that it wasn’t a “democracy” at all, but that “representative form” which is definitely non-inclusive.  Like a microcosm of world “plutocracies”, this too shall pass.  <br />
<br />
The truth shall set ye free<br />
<br />
peace<br />
<br />
[edit: ps- i subscribed to this thread on the off chance there would be another game... still a new b]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Mar 13, 2004, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I learnt so much from the 2 demogames I participated in. When I started, I was playing Emperor level - but rarely winning - just surviving until the end. Now I'm winning deity level games, and even participating in D+3 Succession games!!!!!!!! :eek:<br />
<br />
So thanks to all those who've helped me become a much better Civ player!! :goodjob:</div></div><hr />
