it too early to discuss policy, we dont even know what starting techs we have. Hopefully we will get a nation with a good iron age UU or one to replace knights or cavalry. It would assist us well, as it seems the playing style of the last demogame focused on these units.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thankyou. I dont expect that I have any unique ideas nor unbeatable strategies but I think that we should start to 'kick around' some basic principles.<br />
<br />
1). Are we in favour of a strong standing army or should we build as required?<br />
If we want a standing army what should be in it?<br />
How big should it be?<br />
<br />
2). Are we in favour of early campaigns to eliminate immediate opposition.<br />
If so. Do we aim for the weakest civs or the ones with the best tiles?<br />
<br />
3). Are we in favour of a small number of the best units or can we achieve as much with an army of varied quality.<br />
<br />
4). How do we ensure that the army gets a fair bite of the budget and producrion allocation without becoming a bloc vote in debates?<br />
<br />
<br />
If we can achieve a consensus on some of these things then we can focus more easily on winning. So lets get debating.<br />
<br />
To victory, Brothers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reddwarfian</div><div class="date">Apr 28, 2003, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) I beleive that we should have a standing army, like 2 or 3 of the biggest offensive unitswe can get per providence and at least one bombardment peice per providence.  If we do this, we should have a plan for slow or speedy unit building programs incase we declare war, or are the targets of war, respectively.  <br />
<br />
2) I think we should go for the ones with the best tiles, ones that would reap immediate or future benefits.  <br />
<br />
3) I beleive that we should have a army of the biggest units that we can get.  We may want to keep a few ancient units as &quot;Museum Peices.&quot; ;)<br />
<br />
4) Easy: Get more people involved ;) :) :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Immortal</div><div class="date">Apr 28, 2003, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It will be very simple to define policy once we start the game, for instance if we start without the ability to build spearmen, I would suggest this be the first tchnology to attempt to acquire.<br />
<br />
1). Are we in favour of a strong standing army or should we build as required?<br />
If we want a standing army what should be in it?<br />
How big should it be?<br />
 In despotism, we have the luxury of the maintainence of a truly large army. It will allow a good blend of units, many defensive located in cities, but I would like to have roaming units within our territory patrolling our borders. Then when they are needed to be upgraded, they return to the nearest border town.<br />
<br />
2). Are we in favour of early campaigns to eliminate immediate opposition.<br />
If so. Do we aim for the weakest civs or the ones with the best tiles?<br />
 Hopefully we will encounter a weak civ with great tiles, however I would take out the &quot;insignificants&quot; first, then move on to larger, wealthier nations.<br />
<br />
3). Are we in favour of a small number of the best units or can we achieve as much with an army of varied quality.<br />
 Varied quality I would have to say<br />
<br />
4). How do we ensure that the army gets a fair bite of the budget and producrion allocation without becoming a bloc vote in debates?<br />
The existence of the group will indicate to our govern,ment officials that indeed the military is an integral part of our empire, which our citizens value greatly. For positions other then domestic, I voted this term for those persons whom I know share my beliefs in military and offensive campaigns. Luckily with a  large number of BoS members in government this term, we will find the government probably will be having an ample military for this term. if its cut in the future, I will definitely have to reevaluate my support for certain candidates</div></div><hr />

<br />
My only input right now is that we should strike first and hard at those nations that don't have a UU to start off with (France, US, England, etc...).  If we can &quot;subdue&quot; those aforementioned nations, we'll have quite a good leap ahead.</div></div><hr />

<br />

I favour maintaining a strong standing army as soon as that becomes feasible. It not only means that we can attack or retaliate at will, but will consistently get us better treatment in negotiations with the AI.<br />
<br />
2). Are we in favour of early campaigns to eliminate immediate opposition.<br />
If so. Do we aim for the weakest civs or the ones with the best tiles?<br />
I think it's worth waiting until we have discovered which Civ we are playing as, since some are far more suited to early aggression than others and I'm not sure we really need to risk trying a warrior rush at this level ;)<br />
<br />
If we do go for early attacks we should choose our victims on a case by case basis, taking both factors into account. If the civ in question is weak because their available terrain is hopeless then we probably have little to gain in the long term by such a move. We also need to be very sure that, if we take on a strong civ whose terrain gives them a powerhouse production base, we will be able to keep the initiative and make substantial long terms gains by the conflict. Unless of course we're going for a cyclic beatdown strategy, but I get the feeling few people are interested in playing that kind of game this time.<br />
<br />
3). Are we in favour of a small number of the best units or can we achieve as much with an army of varied quality.<br />
I prefer using large numbers of cheap units where defence is concerned - concentrating on warrior production in the early game then eventually phasing them out to replace them with pikemen for the duration of the medieval era (bypassing musketmen as far as possible). On the offensive, I like to field large forces of cutting edge units - using chariot &gt; horsemen &amp; warrior &gt; swordsman upgrade rushes to achieve this early on at minimum cost.<br />
<br />
4). How do we ensure that the army gets a fair bite of the budget and producrion allocation without becoming a bloc vote in debates?<br />
As I believe Immortal said above, the existence and increasing size of this group should in itself be a source of pressure upon government. I also suspect that most of our members will naturally tend to vote for domestic &amp; presidential candidates who favour military strength without the issue of bloc voting even coming up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd definantly say a strong standing army. Mostly cheap defensive units, with roaming offensive mixed in.<br />
<br />
2). Are we in favour of early campaigns to eliminate immediate opposition. If so. Do we aim for the weakest civs or the ones with the best tiles? <br />
<br />
I agree with past statements that this judgement should be made both on our civ and the position of our enemies, with a strong mind towards UU's.<br />
<br />
3). Are we in favour of a small number of the best units or can we achieve as much with an army of varied quality? <br />
<br />
I'm in favor of a large army of varied quality, for reasons listed above.<br />
<br />
4). How do we ensure that the army gets a fair bite of the budget and producrion allocation without becoming a bloc vote in debates? <br />
<br />
If there are enough same minded people we will not have to decide to vote in blocs, it will naturally happen.</div></div><hr />

What I meant about bloc voting was that if we become a large group then we can have an undue influence. <br />
As a group with common aims we are likely to find it easier to mobilise ourselves to vote for what we want as one body and so overcome the 'individuals' voting against us. I was concerned that this might go against the spirit of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My take on the strategy is slightly different.  Once you have a few core cities with a culture building and a barracks you should crank out the best troops possible until you have enough pre-built to attack the nearest neighbor w/desirable lands.  The target can be selectively chosen, but an early UU does not always discourage me.  In fact, a pre-emptive strike on the Romans is usually better than waiting around to be hammered w/legionaires.<br />
<br />
1). Are we in favour of a strong standing army or should we build as required? If we want a standing army what should be in it? How big should it be?<br />
<br />
Pre-build an army of the best possible units before the outbreak of war.  Ratio of offensive/defensive should be 4/1, with a minor adjustment for stronger/weaker offensive units.  If able add some settlers and workers into the offensive force.  The force should be large enough to take and hold 3-5 cities w/o reinforcements.<br />
<br />
2). Are we in favour of early campaigns to eliminate immediate opposition. If so. Do we aim for the weakest civs or the ones with the best tiles?<br />
<br />
Best tiles is better, but the territory should be a natural extension of the empire.  Ideally the new territory would be suitable for a FP should a leader become available.  In some cases the civ needs to be expelled, like if the Greeks are neighbors and the only sci civ around.<br />
<br />
3). Are we in favour of a small number of the best units or can we achieve as much with an army of varied quality.<br />
<br />
Best units, with the exception that a few horsemen are a good compliment to swords in offense and defence.<br />
<br />
4). How do we ensure that the army gets a fair bite of the budget and producrion allocation without becoming a bloc vote in debates?<br />
<br />
The usual - bribes, propaganda, extortion, media manipulation. :p<br />
<br />
But seriously, there must be a deliberate decision to commit to an expansionist approach early in the game or we will not get sufficient resources (until we're attacked).<br />
<br />
EDIT: I just read this from the Children of Peace group.<br />
No aggressive war is legitimate, may it be for tiles, cities or ressources.<br />
<br />
They go on to say that war should be purely defensive and ended ASAP.<br />
<br />
Gee, we just need to play nice and the AI will just give us all the land, luxuries and stategic resouces that we need to be competitive.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grandmaster</div><div class="date">Apr 30, 2003, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1). Are we in favour of a strong standing army or should we build as required? If we want a standing army what should be in it? How big should it be?<br />
<br />
The true measure of a nation's strength is its standing army.  We mjst be ready at all times to quickly and decisively counter any foreign threat with overwhelming force.  Likewise, we must be constantly prepared to go on the offensive.  We should build the biggest military we can; my general rule of thumb is to build as many units as you can support free (Despotism, Monarchy, Communism) and then some.  The army should consist of a mixture of offensive and defensive units (plus artillery when useful units become available.)  We should build the best defenders we can in large enough numbers to hold back any enemy advances for at least a turn or two, and enough of the best offensive units to then move in and smash the enemy army with a counterattack.  I personally prefer counterstrikes and counterinvading enemy land to simply sitting back and defending.<br />
<br />
2). Are we in favour of early campaigns to eliminate immediate opposition. If so. Do we aim for the weakest civs or the ones with the best tiles?<br />
<br />
We must hit early and hit hard.  It is best to destroy the enemy before they can grow into a threat.  I do not think we should concentrate on one or the other.  We should simply aim to conquer everyone around us.  I believe we are playing with Continents(?)  If so, our aim should be to unite the continent with constant warfare early on, and then hold it from outsiders.  We should be constantly at war from the discovery of Iron Working to the developement of Gunpowder.  By that time we should have enough land, and should concentrate on creating a Fortress Randomania, an impenetrable continent fortified so heavilly that no force on earth could take it.  The Roman Empire (real life) was built and held together by the glue of constant expansion, always pushing forward and redrawing the borders.  We must do the same.<br />
<br />
3). Are we in favour of a small number of the best units or can we achieve as much with an army of varied quality.<br />
<br />
We should build the best units possible.  Throught the RL Cold War, the United States concentrated on building quality units, while the Soviet Union built them in quantity.  An American tank could kill 5 Russian ones; so as long as the Russians didn't have 6 tanks, the Americans would win.  Now, imagine if we had large numbers of quality units.  If we do not let the damned foolish Doves get in the way of our military building (which must be the main priority of our indsutry) then we can build the best units in great amounts.  That is how we will win wars; an army that overwhelms the enemy with power and numbers,<br />
<br />
4). How do we ensure that the army gets a fair bite of the budget and producrion allocation without becoming a bloc vote in debates?<br />
<br />
What's wrong with bloc votes? :mischief:  Honestly, we must simply press the issue.  We must get Hawks elected as President, Military Leader, Domestic Leader, and as Governors.  We must simply try to convince everyone (or at least a majority) of taking our view.  If you are elected Governor, you must put large numbers of units in your queues.  If you are Domestic, you must authorize military spending, and order unit building in all Domestic-controlled cities.  If we press the thing, we will be able to force it upon the Doves.  The other option, of course, is to start a war.  Even the peace-lovers (:rolleyes:) will order units to be built when they see Randomania in trouble.</div></div><hr />

I only posted my questions as an icebreaker so we could get an idea on the views that each member holds.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peri</div><div class="date">May 01, 2003, 05:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My own strategy:<br />
<br />
I think that we should be in a position where each city can repel an initial attack and hold out long enough to be relieved by our army.<br />
In times of peace while we consolidate we should have a small mobile army of the best offensive units available to achieve the above<br />
When we are at war we should have a larger army of appropriate types with our 'peace time' army forming the backbone.<br />
Our cities should be capable of churning out units as required to achieve full mobilization in shortest time.<br />
Land is the key to success so I believe we should dermine our weakest neighbour and eliminate him asap. Then we can concentrate on building up our infrastructure to allow us to take on the next enemy.<br />

<br />
1 more point:<br />
<br />
I don't really favor building a bunch of mixed-quality troops if we cannot use them before they become obsolete.  It would be much better to have fewer high-quality troops and spend the extra on tech and infrastructure.  That would put us in a better position to mobilize (literally or figuratively) when the inevitable war occurs.</div></div><hr />

We really need a settler factory first.  The capital will have stunted growth.  Warrior scouts should circle around until local area revealed.<br />
<br />
I was just reading the GOTM QSC results.  Ribannah took top place by having a lone archer go on the offensive.  Archer scouts are something to consider if we trade for Warrior Code.<br />
<br />
What if an enemy Scout comes within range?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maples45</div><div class="date">May 05, 2003, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I suggest that we seek to expand our territory peacefully until all available/worthwhile land has been settled. Then and only then should we turn to war to advance out territories. A large urban base will allow for greater military production in the future.  Thus, a large emphasis should initally be placed on settlers and explorative units, as well as defensive units.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that we need a large army in peacetime.  I would say that it needs to be nearly the size of our wartime army.  In my opinion, the bigger the army, the better for our nation.  If we decide to go to war, we can quickly and decisevely capture cities before the computer goes beyond it's usual stage in the first few turns of sending in scattered units.  In peacetime, we need a strong army as a detterent.  Besides, when do we plan on having peace anyway?</div></div><hr />

Personally I think we should plan to completely destoy Egypt. As far as we can tell they do not have a connection to Iron, but we do know they are connected to horses. Our advisors say that the most powerful unit that we know of is the warrior (1.1.1) but it won't be too long before we see War Chariots (2.1.2) coming in to our lands. <br />
