<br />
Forgive me for asking a question that's probably been discussed before, but I'm new to the list.<br />
<br />
I'm working on a historical scenario, and having trouble figuring out how to make units that are specific to a particular civilization.  For instance, I want to make a unit that only the Russians can build.  I don't want to tie this to technology, because I don't want other civilizations to be able to gain this tech, and thereby build this unit.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
John Moser</div></div><hr />

<br />
- create a tech<br />
- give that tech to the civ that should be able to build the unit (via cheat menu)<br />
- make that tech the prerequisite for the unit you wish<br />
- finally disable the tech by making it´s prerequisites no/no<br />
<br />
Result: only the civ that has received that tech via the cheat menu can build the unit that is relatet to that tech, the other civs not (and they can not research that tech, because it´s not researchable - due to the no/no).<br />
<br />
There are some more ways, you can try a bit, but it should work as described above...http://forums.civfanatics.com/ubb/wink.gif <br />

<br />
jmoser:  take a look at  this scenario guide... (http://gene.wins.uva.nl/~jvermeir/civ2/guides.htm)  and not to mention Blackclove's excellent guide at SLeague. (http://sleague.apolyton.net/Guides/sldt_tech_tree_one.shtml) <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exile</div><div class="date">Apr 23, 2001, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes, you may want to deliver an advanced unit to a specific civ during the course of the game, and you might even want it to go obsolete at a certain point in the scenario as well. There is a way to do this. <br />
<br />
Each civ in the scenario should have a tech assigned to it. This tech will serve no other purpose but to obsolete the units assigned to that civ. Then you give this tech to all the other civs at the start of the scenario. So that each civ should have a list of techs that do nothing but obsolete the civ-specific units of other civs. Example; in a WWI scenario, the German civ would have a &quot;Brit&quot; tech and this tech would obsolete all British units, so that the German civ could never build British units. Likewise, the German civ would also have a &quot;Russian&quot; tech, which would obsolete all Russian units, and so on for all the other civs. The only civ which does not have the &quot;German&quot; tech is the German civ. So, once the scenario is set up, each civ has a list of techs that prevent the other civs from ever building its units. <br />
<br />
There are other tricks to making units go obsolete at certain times during a scenario. If you're interested post here again, and I'll elaborate.<br />
