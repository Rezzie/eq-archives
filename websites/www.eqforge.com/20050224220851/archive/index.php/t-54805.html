Things to consider:<br />
Tax rates, what about science?<br />
Which cities should get improvements?<br />
What to do with settler?<br />
Will BS celebrate?<br />
Diplomacy?<br />
<br />
Forgot to attach file before:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jun 01, 2003, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great progress :goodjob:<br />
<br />
It looks like we should continue celebrating for one or more probably 2-3 turns by increasing luxuries to 60%, rush buying temples in VM and FW and adjusting production. This way many of our size 6/7 cities will reach size 8.<br />
<br />
Dou's caravan is headed for Paris but an interesting option is to deliver it to Teno next turn instead. This probably results in a lower delivery bonus but would give us much needed cash for which we could probably rush buy several improvements.<br />
<br />
It may be a good idea to let Dou temporarily support LC's settler.<br />
<br />
And now for something completely different: If we want some action we could consider sending 2-3 tiremes loaded with crusaders on a 'friendly' visit to the Aztecs.</div></div><hr />
