<br />
Frustration.<br />
<br />
I bought and returned 480 DRAM (advertiesd as 512), 2.52 ghz, 80 gigabyte Sony 4 $2000 w/$400 refund.<br />
<br />
First thing I noticed is that it loads with a bunch of c*** on, so I have to remove that every time it loads (they moved config.exe out of system info!!)<br />
<br />
Then I realize that Windows XP is taking up 256 megs RAM. :eek:<br />
<br />
This just doesn't make any sense: so now my system is already only 'minimum requirements' for all those 256megs RAM games/programs out there, since XP takes up 53.3% of my RAM! :eek: <br />
<br />
Or does it just 'reserve' that for later use and free it up if available? :confused:<br />
<br />
See the big DEBACLE with this is that MOST computers are 256 megs or even 128 RAM.. so XP takes up all or nearly all space, and you're left with a $699 CRAWLER!!!<br />
<br />
Civ III sure does move pretty fast, though  not  10x faster as my older computer. (401mhz, 64RAM, Pentium3)<br />
<br />
Remedy: have people choose between DOS, '98, barebones XP (no bugs, no extras that no one uses, slimmer style [they keep getting fatter]), or FAT XP. :goodjob:<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
Rename XP to XF [Xtra Fat] OS. :nuke:<br />
<br />
To-do list:<br />
Reverse engineer Civ III and fix pathfinding. :scan:<br />
<br />
EDIT: EMPEROR, NOT EMPORER!</div></div><hr />

<br />
AMD Athlon XP 1800+<br />
My total system RAM 256 megs of DDR<br />
On bootup I have 203 free megs of RAM<br />
Operating System Windows XP Proffessional<br />
Total reboot time 29 seconds.<br />
<br />
Longest Civ III turn length:  About 5 seconds on a huge map.<br />
<br />
Prepackaged computers suck, restore CD's suck, and my own personal favorite, Intel sucks (the cash right from your wallet).  Buy AMD, learn XP, and build your own computer.  This has been a public service announcement.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Willem</div><div class="date">Aug 24, 2002, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what's the point here? I used to play games on a Commodore 64 with, you guessed it, 64 K of RAM. That's K, not Meg. I believ I even played Civ 1 on it.  Does that mean that computers should have stayed like that? Things change, programs become more powerful, which means they need more resources. That's just the way it goes. If you don't like it, don't get into computers and read a book instead!</div></div><hr />

512-480=32MB<br />
<br />
perhaps shared video card is taking up to 32MB system memory.I don't see scam at all- they provided you with 512MB RAM sticks.<br />
Problems is you, my friend, because you don't know what are you buying.</div></div><hr />
