<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ohkrana</div><div class="date">Aug 28, 2002, 02:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well currently, I'm a poverty stricken IT student! As well as some others who frequent the forum. ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway on to the actual points:<br />
<br />
Just a quick background<br />
<br />
1 - I'm currently studying IT Networks (Cisco, Linux, C++, Java the main foci)<br />
<br />
2 - Also overloading with a teaching/training Certificate<br />
<br />
As to why?<br />
<br />
3 - I'm interested in sharing/hearing Tips from/with anyone who is studying or has studied similar material.<br />
<br />
4 - As I'm looking at taking a Job in an IT teaching/educator role. It's important that I be focused in not just what material I will present in the future but in how I present, said material. So any tips/recommendations be it from students or teachers are welcome.<br />
<br />
5 - Currently stuck/consumed with Cisco - TCS -Threaded or as some say Dreaded Case Study. So naturally, interested in other people's experiences with this beast! :)<br />
<br />
For the international forummers; studying under TAFE which is similar to a US style college; in my estimate.<br />
<br />
In advance, thanks for your time and interest.<br />
PS - great computer forum; keep it alive and ticking.</div></div><hr />
