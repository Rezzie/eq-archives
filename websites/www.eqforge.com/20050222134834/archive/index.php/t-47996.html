With the arrival of more units, we will be able to expand in all directions, but I think we should focus on one.<br />
<br />
The A) choices are the choices for the current Archer we have and B) choices are for long-term foreign affairs expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Mar 19, 2003, 03:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, as I said before - it is currently an exploratory unit and therefore under the remit of the Foreign Advisor. However, feel free to argue it's use for defence/attack which can be included in the poll. Don't forget, some things work differently in this demogame to CivIII. Any doubts, check the Constitution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Mar 19, 2003, 03:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted to concentrate on Continental exploration first, to check if we're alone or not. Overseas is out of the question until we get Mapmaking, or bribe a barb boat.<br />
<br />
I suggest exploring southwest, to uncover some more land around RF. Hopefully the hut will give another unit to take each side of the island.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Mar 19, 2003, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted for two of the A's, Continue SE and Southwest. I'm not sure we're supposed to be able to vote like that (otherwise these choices wouldn't both be called A ?) but the reason I did is that RF will soon build warriors which should head SW. In addition, our settler will soon found a city that should immediately build warriors (maybe unless we get a unit from the hut) that can head SE (or possibly E). Another warriors unit may be needed to stop civil disorder.<br />
<br />
Also I voted for continental expansion, we do not have mapmaking and even if we did overseas expansion would IMO be premature until we have explored our continent, unless it turns out to be very big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zelig</div><div class="date">Mar 19, 2003, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we should just explore where there are likely to be huts according to the hut pattern.<br />
<br />
I voted for continental expansion, we don't have mapmaking and after we've finsished colonizing our continent we won't get land barbs anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Mar 19, 2003, 07:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We should explore the continent at the moment, not many other options really:)  But if we look a bit further, I think we should find some empty island and place a few cities there (for trade purposes and to spread out the empire a bit) . Especially if we live on a small island, but also if the continent is big enough for our empire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elsaak</div><div class="date">Mar 19, 2003, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, explore on continent : the archer go SE, and the settler + warrior one or two in SW (until he is needed in RF)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">Mar 19, 2003, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted SE for the Archer.  RF will have it's own Warrior eventually that can explore around the city.  Meanwhile the Archer should keep exploring away from our empire to increase the chance of NON units from huts.<br />
<br />
voted Continental exploration for now, until we have a better idea of the size of our continent and actually have boats to allow sea exploration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">puglover</div><div class="date">Mar 19, 2003, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted<br />
<br />
Archer = SW<br />
<br />
Exploration = Focus on Continent</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shahadet</div><div class="date">Mar 23, 2003, 08:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I want to see the land WEST of the capital revealed. The archer can continue exploring to the east to grab some more huts however.<br />
<br />
I would also like to see a relatively early bid for map making (after acquiring trade that is) so as to set up overseas colonies. The trade the can generate from caravans to out SSC (when we found one) is very useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archer 007</div><div class="date">Mar 24, 2003, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I vpted to focus on expansion a bit at home and abroad.</div></div><hr />
