Can't you, or is it better to build a city on a resource?:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eyrei</div><div class="date">Nov 26, 2001, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just build the city.  Colonies are pretty worthless.</div></div><hr />

I only use colonies when the resource is right on the outskirts of town and I want the resource ASAP instead of waiting for cultural expansion.</div></div><hr />

They are a cheap way of stealing a resource.  For example, after a war the cultural influence of a city is the original 1 square around.  There are scads of them after a big war.  Sometimes the cities you and your ally have are just out of reach of the resource.  The resource is not going to end up in your sphere of control, but your allies.  You go out and plop a worker down and start taking it immediately.  Hey, after war you get all those free workers anyways.  You use the resource as long as you can and devote to building the units that otherwise you will be unable to build.  Then, you go and use those units either on your once ally..or go find another poor soul and take it.  It has saved me numerous times. Especially for oil!  Need those tanks.</div></div><hr />

After I build them settlers(not mine!) come and build right next to them stealing them out from me. Theres nothing you can do. Its a waste.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DoorFrame</div><div class="date">Nov 27, 2001, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i've seen the ai use them quite effectively actually.  the zulus were stuck on england, norway and greenland on the world map, but there was still a lot of open space and a lot of unclaimed resources in the middle of asia.  of course, this was fairly late in the game so by that time the world had pretty much been completely railroaded, not by the zulus but by the chinese.... even land not within their territory.  <br />
<br />
by the time my tanks got over there i found about a half dozen zulu colonies collecting not only luxuries but strategic resources from across the globe using other civ's railroad's to transport them home.  there's so much dead space in asia (with mountains and tundras) that it's barely worth building there, even near resources which are quite common over there to begin with. <br />
<br />
i was quite impressed with the zulus for doing this... they invested almost nothing in these colonies, and if they were eventually were lost, so be it, but for the time being they had luxuries and strategic resources from across the globe for the cost of one infantry man and one worker... quite cheap.  <br />
<br />
my cities eventually took the resources of course, but they probably held them for hundreds of years... and utilized the resources that whole time.</div></div><hr />
