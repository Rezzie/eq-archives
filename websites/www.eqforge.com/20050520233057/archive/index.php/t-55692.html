<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donovan Zoi</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now that we have defined our far west province, I would like to appoint a governor there ASAP.  Of course, if I were to do this now, it would break our DG2 law(which we still seem to be interpreting) as the province presently has only one city.  DG2 law held that the President can only appoint a governor once that province contained three cities.<br />
<br />
So, are my hands tied here?  Or can I take into account our relaxed ruleset and appoint a new governor now before expansion into the province begins?  One settler is headed there now, and one of the next two settlers should add a third city within the next 10-12 turns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rik Meleet</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know DG2 specific ruling on this situation. I only know that the Western Province would need a Governor sooner or later. If you want a Governor there; I would like to be that Governor.  <br />
<br />
Officially: I volunteer for this position when it becomes available.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Immortal</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IS this law expressed in our curent rules? If not then you are not bound by irrelevent past laws. They were set aside for a reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I understand it, the only thing Donavon would break would be an extinct law.  He has the blessing, and the encouragement, of the Ministry of Trade to go ahead with such an appointment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">donsig</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 08:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DG2 rules?  I thought this was DG3?  Hmmm...  the constitution says all offices are to be filled via election for a fixed term or something like that.  Don't see anything about appointments in there.  I would think a special election would be preferable to a presidential appointment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Immortal</div><div class="date">Jun 11, 2003, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">D. All offices will be filled via elections to serve fixed terms.<br />
<br />
 There you have it, looks like a no go SAaM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2003, 03:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now, there's a great idea.  I forgot that Article D was worded that way.<br />
<br />
<br />
I suggest a judicial review, just to settle the issue once and for all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Almightyjosh</div><div class="date">Jun 12, 2003, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) There is no problem with a province having only one city under our current law, however<br />
2) All offices must be filled by election<br />
<br />
DZ, open nominations for 24-36 hours only, then post a poll with a 48 hour limit.  This is the minimum time a poll should take to be democratic.  Start NOW and we will soon have a governor in 'Western' Province.</div></div><hr />
