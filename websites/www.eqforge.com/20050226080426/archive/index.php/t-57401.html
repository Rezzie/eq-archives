<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 02, 2003, 05:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd like to nominate funxus for president and TimTheEnchanter for science advisor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2003, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What the heck.  I'll give it another go around.<br />
<br />
I'll nominate Viking for domestic advisor again (you scratch my back... ;) )<br />
<br />
and Archer_007 for Military advisor.  He's been poking around occasionally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Jul 03, 2003, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see that it will be a tight race this month. ;)<br />
<br />
I'll nominate Jayne (and her new husband) for Foreign Advisor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">Jul 04, 2003, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I accept the nomination, I won't have much else to do now anyway. I also second all the nominations.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">Jul 04, 2003, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I accept the nomination for domestic advisor. However, if I get elected I will need a deputy (there's none now) because I will be away from my computer for at least a week late this month.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedBull</div><div class="date">Jul 06, 2003, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Even though I'm new to the Demo game here, I'd like to nominate myself for Military Advisor.  I think I have some interesting ideas to play out in conjunction with our three other advisory spots to deal with our current war on two fronts, while allowing our quest to pull ahead in the science race to come to fruition.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Hopefully you'll accept my nomination even though it was posted at 1 AM on the 6th!  I took a day to think about whether or not I had the time to devote to the spot, and I've come to realize that there's no way I couldn't! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jul 06, 2003, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome to the Commonwealth!  I'll second the nomination.  I'm sure DoM will make an exception.  :)<br />
<br />
Also, barring a sudden reappearance and acceptance from Jayne, I'll run for FA just to fill out the election roster.  I've been lurking around long enough to know what's going on.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RedBull</div><div class="date">Jul 06, 2003, 10:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since this is the first election I'll be part of, I assume it's going up as a poll, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">Jul 07, 2003, 12:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, since we only had one person for each position, there is no need for an actual election.<br />
<br />
<br />
The results are:<br />
<br />
President: funxus<br />
<br />
Domestic Advisor: TheViking<br />
<br />
Foreign Minister: Octavian X<br />
<br />
Military Advisor: RedBull<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2003, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks DoM for my nomination - I've been away for a few days so I've not been around.  It's nice to see some new blood, and old faces return.<br />
<br />
I'm happy to let Oct X borrow my extravagent office in the Ministry of Foreign affairs! ;) If needed, I'm happy to relocate to the Deputy Foreign minister desk in the broom cupboard!! :lol:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jul 08, 2003, 05:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a few doughnuts, and the office will be perfect.  :)<br />
<br />
Seriously, though, if you want the FA spot, you can have it.  I'd rather you have it, since you're more active than me here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">Jul 09, 2003, 03:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm quite busy at the moment so you can have the post - unless you prefer us to jointly share the post.<br />
<br />
As for doughnuts - raspberry jam ok? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Octavian X</div><div class="date">Jul 09, 2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That works for me.  The more, the merrier.  :)<br />
<br />
Also, we  need some of those mini-powdered doughnuts.  :D</div></div><hr />
