A total of 104 players participated in this GOTM! The max number of participants for the Civ2 GOTM doesn't even come close to that. On the GOTM section, you will find a detailed results page in HTML format and an Excel format results file as usual. We uploaded 2 zip files containing the saved games. The first zip file contains all submitted games and the other zip file only contains the final saved games (i.e. no 1 AD saves)<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;EEKthedog&lt;/i&gt; has won the Game of the Month. Behind him are &lt;i&gt;Aeson&lt;/i&gt; (he became second) and &lt;i&gt;Lucky&lt;/i&gt; who also won the gold medal for the GOTM for Civ2. Congratulations to these winners and thanks everyone for playing!<br />

So I could have done better. :)<br />
<br />
Also nice to mention: my brother, Nitro, played this GOTM as well this time. But he did better than me. He's always better! :cry:</div></div><hr />

I know it's not the best way to score, but it would help people, who would never dream of it, be included in the hall of fame. It may sound like a joke, but i'm really suggesting it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And guys, thanks for the compliments. :o Indeed it was a monkish job. But I was also quite late (also because this is the first time I made the results for the Civ3GOTM). And I also say &quot;never again&quot;. Because 100 people are so many! :eek: That's why everyone now has to include his/her score and other data when submitting. Then I'll only check the highest scores for vality. Otherwise it's simply un-doable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Dec 10, 2001, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What an unbelievable month!:D <br />
My second Civ3 game and then finishing 3rd. WOW! :king: <br />
AND my 3rd Civ2 GOTM game and winning that one.<br />
What a great month.:lol: <br />
<br />
But in Civ3 you are much more dependant on good luck with the huts, especially in the beginning. And of course the Bonus for an early finish is much too high as you see clearly in the results. I believe that we should wait for the results of the 2nd GOTM and then decide on a new scoring system.<br />
Anyway I´m proud for achieving such good results in both GOTMs but I congratulate everybody else for their efforts.:goodjob: <br />
<br />
And my biggest thanks goes to Matrix for the fabulous work he is doing. We love you! :love:</div></div><hr />

Please not! We only made our own scoring system for the GOTM for Civ2, because the one of the game itself was inferior and didn't make a nice goal to persue, because it was only a matter of how much time you were willing to spend for it. This scoring system just emphasizes much more on how fast you end the game; does that make the game less fun to play?<br />
<br />
Furthermore I'm just very against an own scoring system, because that makes it controversial. Now that Firaxis made a very good scoring system, we can at last call one scoring system &quot;holy&quot;. Thank God for that.<br />

I've made another one as well, and that certainly fits my performance in this GOTM: :suicide:</div></div><hr />

It seems to me some people will have started it before the patch, while others, like me, will be starting after the patch- when Iron Working takes 40 turns to research, forests only yield building quality wood once, and the Great Lighthouse dissappears below the horizon.  (How) Will you distinguish pre and post patch games?</div></div><hr />

I knew my victory was pretty fast, but i didn't expect this.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i just used my standard tactic: Send warriors and archers to the first civ you see and overrun them. Always works, especially if they don't have bronze working :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I think so. Given that whoever finishes fastest most likely wins (look at how close to perfect correlation there is between finishing date and score), it means that the only realistic way to win GOTM is by military might.<br />
<br />
Given civ3 has other ways of winning (culture, diplomacy, space race), I think they should be given a fair chance of being winning strategies for GOTM.<br />
<br />
The current scoring system clearly favours a quick victory way too much - the last thing you want is civ3 games being like starcraft where he who pulls off the early rush wins. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cruise</div><div class="date">Dec 11, 2001, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It simply does work that way on small maps and pangea maps with 1 big island.<br />
<br />
With gotm2 it is a lot harder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ChrisShaffer</div><div class="date">Dec 11, 2001, 06:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I definitely think there should be a different scoring system.  The Civ3 point system is far too dependent on territory acquisition.<br />
<br />
Locke's 1822 Space Race victory, for example, makes me go wow.  There were two people that scored higher, but I argue that it was the best Space Race victory -- by a long shot.  The fact Locke acquired less territory is pretty meaningless in terms of the type of victory -- yet amount of territory was the primary indicator of success when you count by points.<br />
<br />
Using points as the primary indicator of success would be a mistake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awesome matrix :king: <br />
<br />
EEk ???   410BC without ever seeing the map, and not knowing anything about the opposition or resources ???<br />
<br />
Matrix maybe you should let people try the GOTM as many times as they like, afterall it still takes a lot of skill to get a good score no matter how many times you see the map, and well I have a feeling many do that anyway, atleast then we all know where we stand, even though it is just for amazing fun :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kev</div><div class="date">Dec 12, 2001, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holy Immortals, Batman!  I barely made the top half in my 46th place!!!  Long way from usually finishing in the top 10 in Civ2 games!!!<br />
<br />
Looks like conquest will be the way to go for each month if that possibility exists.  I know it will be a tougher challenge in GTOM#2, but with any small/pangea map this will have to be the way to go to get a medal.  I knew that conquest was looking like the favorable way to play judging by the spoiler talks, but the fact that the top 31 scores (top THIRD) are conquest victories says that there may be some unfair bias here.  I know it'll probably be a pain, but I would think that somehow down the line someone could come up with a way we could provide some parity for each style of win.<br />
<br />
I guess with Civ2, it could pay to continue playing for a while.  The spaceship added a good deal of points, wonders gave some points, and population could grow so quickly with WLTK days that it could really pay off to stay with the game and grow your civ.  With Civ3, looks like speed to victory will just about supercede all else, and that's a shame.<br />
<br />
For the time being, however, this is very enjoyable and I've learned quite a bit I think.<br />
<br />
Finally,  I can't WAIT to download EEK's final game and look at the (very quick) relpay.  I just can't envision HOW this was done.  Kudos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Dec 12, 2001, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a lot of GOTM01 was decided by the first goody hut, for the conquest victories at least.  The first time I played, I got a settler from it, and finished in 30AD.  Just to see how much the settler had meant to my score I played again.  Without the settler I finished in 600AD, with almost the exact same strategy.  The only real differences were the first time around I lost a few galleys full of Immortals due to accidents (I play on a notebook computer, no numberpad for diagonals and the touchpad is harder for me to control than a mouse...poor galleys), and had sent my first couple galleys off in the wrong direction.  The difference in score was almost 1900 points (~6500 to ~4600).  The early settler was a huge difference on this map.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karl Marx the Penguin</div><div class="date">Dec 12, 2001, 11:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was the highest scorer of the honorable defeats!!!<br />
<br />
No one who lost (except for one guy who lost by conquest) had a higher score!!<br />
<br />
I wonder how so many people did so well. This was my first Civ3 game (except for about 35 turns of a game I started before I downloaded the GOTM). I was so busy in November that I only finished the game at about 4 PM GMT the day it was due.<br />
<br />
Only about 9 people turned a losing GOTM!!<br />
I wonder how many decided not to turn in....<br />
<br />
Anyways I hope to reach the middle of the pack this time. Yet I doubt it. My second game of Civ3 is going to be GOTM2.<br />
<br />
At least it is best three of last five. Instead of the penalizing system in Civ2gotm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think many people who have a bad game just do not submit.  Same thing happens in Civ 2 GOTMs.  If you read the spoilers you'll see some who say they're not submitting.  I expect the same happens in civ 3.<br />
<br />
RE: Civ 3 scoring.  Seems early conquest gets the BIG scores which can't be gotten any other way.  Do we come up with a Civ 3 GOTM scoring system (similar to the one for Civ 2) or do we segregate the scores according to type of win?  I favor the latter because a UN victory will never beat an early conquest score for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aeson</div><div class="date">Dec 13, 2001, 08:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that depending on the map settings, different GOTM's will have different &quot;best&quot; victory conditions.  Certainly on smaller maps the early conquest bonus will make that the highest scoring method.  On larger maps conquest won't be able to be achieved as quickly, so the conquest bonus will be less.  On the current GOTM I think that the highest scores will come from those who develop as much of the land as possible, and don't win till late in the game.  There's only one way I can think of that a conquest victory would come early enough to give a big enough bonus to win this GOTM, and that's by using an exploitative strategy that has been taken care of with the patch.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the patch, have any of you been able to relocate your palace after patching?  I have a great leader that I earmarked for that very purpose, but none of my cities can build the palace.  I checked every city, and no one was already building it, any ideas as to why it's greyed out?  If I can't relocate it, then my whole game is terribly messed up :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sultan Bhargash</div><div class="date">Dec 13, 2001, 08:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have had that problem with wonders before, it takes a bit to figure it out.  If you have disbanded units, harvested a forest for shields, payed for shields, or in any way rushed a building you will not get to build a wonder or palace until you finish the less extraordinary thing you are building.  You also cant build a palace in a city which is totally or primarily conquered citizens of a different nationality, it seems to me.  Or you havent developed construction yet.  Otherwise, you have a bug.</div></div><hr />

Speaking of the patch, have any of you been able to relocate your palace after patching?You might have put the palace in some other city queue. I know that if you put a wonder in a queue, it cannot be built in another city. This must be true for the palace after the patch also. I can't think of anything else.</div></div><hr />
