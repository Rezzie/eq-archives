<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since we will soon start expanding more than we've done for some time we'll need new city names. AFAIK only one name from the last city name poll has not been used, Chitchen Itza. And everyone knows where Barbarians Suck will be founded :D.<br />
<br />
So if you have city name suggestions post them here. I'll then post a city name poll in a few days.<br />
<br />
I'll start by suggesting Fort Jayne as the name for the first city we found on another continent/island.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think our next city should be named after Jayne. I was about to name Igloria in honor of Jayne, especially because it was close to her proposed Jayne's Hill, but I couldn't come up with a good name. <br />
<br />
I also think we should name a city after Gary.<br />
Nemoville maybe<br />
<br />
Trollhättan (if so, preferably a canal city)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fort Jayne on a Foreign continent in honor of our Foreign Advisor.  Excellent idea :thumbsup:<br />
<br />
Jayne should propose a city name in honor of her new hubby :D<br />
<br />
Gary needs a city for sure.  Anybody else not have one yet?<br />
<br />
How about <br />
Kellenberg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">May 15, 2003, 06:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jayne should propose a city name in honor of her new hubby <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In that case - what about  'Fortress Power' or 'FortressOfPower' :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Duke, any ideas for a city in your honor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duke of Marlbrough</div><div class="date">May 15, 2003, 07:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'll let you guys name one for me if you all feel it is warranted.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 16, 2003, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It could be named Blenheim Palace (http://www.blenheimpalace.com/index1.htm).  It's a little obscure for someone that doesn't understand the reference, but how many outsiders could tell that our SSC is named for Octavian X? :lol:</div></div><hr />

It could be named Blenheim Palace (http://www.blenheimpalace.com/index1.htm).  It's a little obscure for someone that doesn't understand the reference, but how many outsiders could tell that our SSC is named for Octavian X? :lol: If you want to find someone who doesn't know how the SSC got its name you don't need an outsider - I hereby admit that the domestic advisor doesn't know it :lol: :lol:<br />
<br />
And now the big question: What does the name Doughnutia have to do with Octavian X ? :confused: :confused:</div></div><hr />

And now the big question: What does the name Doughnutia have to do with Octavian X ? :confused: :confused: That name was his city name suggestion.  I assume it stems from his avatar's fondness for donuts.</div></div><hr />

My previous avatar WAS a doughnut.  :)  Or was it Homer in the nude on the couch eating a doughnut?  I don't remember...</div></div><hr />
