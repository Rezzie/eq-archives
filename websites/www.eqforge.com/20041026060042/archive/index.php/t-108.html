Simplified combat is what civ 1 used to use.  What it means is that units don't have firepower or hitpoints, and they don't have levels of strength either.  Winning battles become a matter of pure chance.  A battleship has a 12:2 chance of destroying a phalanx; meanwhile, the phalanx has a 2:12 chance of winning the battle.  Do this long enough and you are guaranteed to lose a battleship to a phalanx.<br />

So veteran status has no effect in simplified combat games?<br />

As far as I know, it's just like a normal battle. One unit wins and the other loses. The only difference in simplified combat is that whoever wins keep their full bar of energy. So whoever is superior should always win a battle.<br />

see it IS random. Whoever is superior SHOULD win a battle. But because of the randomness that doesn't always happen. it's random but the superior unit still has more of a CHANCE of winning due to the attack and defense ratings.<br />
<br />
Thats why they included the &quot;hit points&quot; and &quot;firepower&quot; ratings in the Civ II. They wanted to try to take away the randomness yet still allow for the randomness of combat.<br />

hehe... that's what I thought. i think it's in the manual somewhere. <br />

Why's nobody listening to us!? it IS random but it uses the attack/defense factors to decide who has the greater/lesser chance of winning. So the weaker unit can in fact win sometime because of that randomness.<br />
<br />
With the phalanx/battleship thing... the battleship often DOES beat the phalanx. But because of the randomness involved in the equation (and the defense factors added due to the fortifying and the mountain) the phalanx wins too much to be realistic.<br />
<br />
THAT'S why they made the more advanced combat system in Civ II. To try to make it more realistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Feb 12, 2001, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Usually, in order to destroy the unit fortified in the mountain fortress, I move around him and take out the supporting city (when it's possible, that is).  <br />
<br />
TeeHee, I just realized the irony of my example.  Phalanx desroys Battleship; Thunderfall is a Battleship, I'm a Phalanx.  Freudian slip?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dreadnought</div><div class="date">Feb 12, 2001, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I tried it once and that was it..why..b/c it sucks. Personally its been awhile since i played it that way but i think i thought there was some chance in it.  but as some have said, if there's a 12:2 ratio and the phalanx wins, than it looks like &quot;chance&quot; b/c the phalanx has a shot at winning. In normal civ2 combat the &quot;chance&quot; of the phalanx winning is far less.<br />
<br />
that doesn't even make sense..?</div></div><hr />
