Things to consider:<br />
Dou need another guard or Colosseum before next growth. Alt. Elvis/scientist.<br />
<br />
What and who do we want to trade with? Polytheism is the only tech we don't have that is on the way to one of our prioritized goals. Construction and Iron working could be nice to - both are preqs for bridge building.<br />
<br />
Also notice how few cities all the others have, Greeks are in the lead with 6 cities, Chinese have 5, Indians and Zulu have 4 and Aztecs and French have 3.<br />
<br />
Zulu and the Aztecs are the only ones who have made contact, except for us and Aztecs.<br />
<br />
Any good city spots we should settle on another island, maybe even before BS!.<br />
<br />
Foreign Minister - where shall we continue to explore? Shall we send a trireme back to pick up a settler. Maybe more triremes? Maybe wait until we have traded maps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 11, 2003, 07:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tech-wise we are much farther ahead of the AI than I expected and it's clear we'll manage to get Cope without any difficulties and Mike shouldn't be a big problem. We should get polytheism through tech trading (prereq for mono/Mike). The only question is when, immediately or after we discover astronomy (probably immediately) ? Bridge building would be nice to get but when (an AI civ has Construction and IW which are prerqs) ? Seafaring is becoming an increasingly important goal, LC and FW really need harbors no later than when we start WLTP as a republic.<br />
<br />
There are remarkably few AI cities so it might be possible to switch to conquering some AI civs and immediately start building 2 or three triremes, fill them with veteran elephants and go and visit the Aztecs. This would slow development.<br />
<br />
The wonder situation mentioned above means that for some time now we'll have time to expand and improve the terrain (meaning building several settlers instead of caravans only). I'm including maps showing several possible city sites - feel free to suggest more. Also I'm indicating where we should start building roads (R), irrigation (W) and mines (M). The highest priorities are IMO the mine near Dou, irrigation near Dou to prepare its growth, probably irrigating one square near Neu, road S of LP and roads in the east (Ipec-VM in particular). One question is where we should build the settlers and where caravans. We probably also need at least two triremes unless one/both triremes return home. What do the foreign and military advisors recommend ?<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate city name suggestions, the only city name we have now is Barbarians Suck. In particular I think a city should be named in honor of our former president.<br />
<br />
Finally, I think Dou should switch from river to silk once the library is completed. This results in slightly less food but we'll grow Dou using WLTP once we are a republic and also I'd like more production because I want to finish a courthouse and/or marketplace in Dou before Cope. If Dou grows in size before republic LC can build a quick warrior and send it to Dou.<br />

The trireme to the far north is near Orleans.  That, and I'm rather bored and have nothing much better to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree withg most of Viking's post. One thing though, C2: Wouldn't it be better to build that city 3NE, to avoid overlapping with BS!, or is it just a canal?<br />
<br />
I don't think we should exchange Polytheism until we need it, it'd slow down astronomy.<br />
<br />
Maybe we should try to road some of the trade generating squares, like silks, esp. in Dou.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 12, 2003, 07:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since we are Supreme, I'd give everything but the kitchen sink to the purple civ.  IIRC, they have several techs we don't have including polytheism despite being several techs behind us.   We should be able to give them everything they ask for, and probably get an alliance.   Gifting them the techs should allow us to significantly reduce our beaker costs.  They should get more happy, and we can ask for Polytheism in a trade as we get closer to catching them up to us.  The cost of polytheism would probably be more than made up for by the benefits of gifting the key civ.<br />
<br />
Also remember, we can't exchange maps unless the other civ has map making.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TimTheEnchanter</div><div class="date">May 12, 2003, 07:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Something else to consider...<br />
<br />
Note that I am not entirely sure I have the complete list of techs right so someone please attempt to verify/refute this, but I think we will not be given a choice of Polytheism after Astronomy is done.  <br />
<br />
If my notes are correct, we should be able to research Monotheism straight away if we get Poly before finishing Astro.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand, it's not like we wouldn't have decent choices if we didn't do it that way (Republic, Seafaring, Construction, Medicine along with junkers Warrior Code and Wheel).  <br />
<br />
Again I qualify this based on the accuracy of my notes about the techs we already have.   I have us with 14 acquired techs plus the two starters we received, researching Astronomy as the 17th tech. If I missed a hut-tech or something like that, this is all out the window.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
C2 is just a canal so I wanted it close to Barbarians Suck. Depending on the geography south of C2 (currently unknown to us) we might want to have it 3NE but given our current knowledge I prefer C2.<br />
<br />
Roading Dou's silk is missing from my map but should have been there, it's a high priority task. We also want road on the river squares (the reason I give BB relatively high priority). However, in general I prioritize irrigation ahead of roads near Dou because I want that city to have sufficient food to quickly grow to size 12 once we become a republic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 12, 2003, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tim, Astronomy is our 17th tech.<br />
<br />
For some reason the indians are Icy towards us, but, as you say, there are plenty of techs we can offer them. What they have that we don't have is: Polytheism, Warrior Code, The Wheel and Iron Working.<br />
<br />
If we also want Construction, we'll have to talk to the Chinese (neutral) or French (Icy).<br />
<br />
We probably should get polytheism then at first, and gift the indians most techs. Then we research Monotheism after Astronomy, and after that we could try and exchange IW and Construction to be able to research BB. <br />
<br />
How about gifting to others for a map? Shall we wait with that? If so, with which civs?<br />
<br />
It will take some time before we can get all caravans into Dou. We could start a wonder (and switch to Cop's once we get Astro), or shall we build another improvement (CH) or shall we build another caravan for either delivery (to Tenoch?) or for the wonder?<br />
<br />
Viking, it's a nice map:goodjob:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jayne</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi! I'm back!!<br />
<br />
Here is a report from the Foriegn Office. Apologies if it repeats what other have already said.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we have Marco's, the Foreign Office recommends contacting each civ to aquire knowledge and maps. As we are close to the French and Zulu's we need to be wary of upsetting them, causing them to sink our exploration vessels.<br />
<br />
We need more triremes and dips to explore the many islands. The Foreign Office also recommends colonising the islands nearest to us before anyone else gets the chance, thereby building up good bases on the islands as a staging post for conflict later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome back Jayne:) <br />
I hope your honeymoon was nice.<br />
<br />
I agree on not upsetting the others, and that we should try to aquire maps and certain techs. Still, are there any techs we don't want, we don't want yet or some of our techs that we don't want to give away? Obviously we should not give away Astronomy until we have built it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the moment we shouldn't give philosophy to any AI civ since it's a prereq for monotheism and many of them already have the other prereq (polytheism). Even the civs that do not have poly shouldn't get philosophy since they might acquire poly by exchanging techs with another AI civ.<br />
<br />
We should try to get poly now from an AI civ.<br />
<br />
We are going to need construction when our cities (esp. SSC) approach size 8 but since many civs have it we are in no hurry to acquire it now.<br />
<br />
The Indians (who incidentally are our key civ) have several techs neither we or other civs have - IW, WC and The Wheel. I see no need for WC but IW is a prereq for BB so it is useful. We don't need the wheel at the moment - we'll need it later if we want Leo.</div></div><hr />

I agree on not upsetting the others, and that we should try to aquire maps and certain techs.<br />
Let's not forget that once we have cities on the same continent as an AI civ we can start demanding (and getting !) tribute from that civ. For that to work the AI civ needs to think we are powerful. It estimates this by counting our units (the type of unit does not matter - two warriors are two times better than one stealth fighter !). So strangely enough, around the time we found a city on another continent it might be a good idea to build a few warriors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 08:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we should start a military consturction program to intimidate the AI, say ptting a fair amount of our cities on cconstructing military units and settlers. To be shipped to other continents. I am also continuing to urge as much exploration as possible if the other civs do not trade maps. I think tech trading could help us alot and speed up the progress of the game. I think we should give the AI as many peaceful techs (except Philosophy) and not as many military techs to ensure that we stay ahead militarily and are able to win our wars.<br />
<br />
Speaking of wars, do we want to launch a military operation against a civ right now or wait. I'm in favor of conquering as much land as possible so we will have an easier time at the end. I think veteran Ellies and Dips on three or four triremes can help us now if we want to go for the Aztecs.</div></div><hr />

So, you gonna tell us your hubby's username, or do we have to guess?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I agree to not giving away Philosophy just yet, and by all means lets get PolyTheism.  As I pointed out in the Science poll, I don't think it will come up for us next time, so if we can get it before we discover Astronomy it will get us to Monotheism faster.<br />
<br />
I would not be in favor of starting a war right now.  Plenty of exploring and expanding to do.  Unless somebody starts getting uppity, of course :D<br />
<br />
I rarely trade maps, because generally I find I have to give too much away for it to be worthwhile.  I know others use this tactic successfully, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leowind</div><div class="date">May 13, 2003, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before I take my short leave of absence, I wanted to post a report.  Monotheism remains our #1 research priority.  Best way to get it is to trade for polytheim before we discover Astronomy so that we can research Mono after Astronomy.  Republic was the next rated priority.  Others will be in the 25 BC science poll, which at the time of this writing was tied between Seafaring and Construction.  Consensus seems to be NOT to trade away Astronomy or Philosophy at this time, but to freely trade other techs to gain those we do not have.  I have asked my deputy CivGeneral to assume Science Advising responsibilities in my absence, but I have not personally heard from him, so if he doesn't show for some reason someone may need to be appointed temporarily.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blissful_Zen</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 03:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as the military side of things, defense is my main concern. With the Elephant coming out to patrol the east only roads hold us from acceptable defensive capabilities. I urge we finish those ASAP. I like to have a few cities on the same continent as the the civ we are attacking.  I think the the next few triemes headin north have 2 settlers and 2 war.  We should get 2 cities up in good spots, near the aztecs, one must be port of course (C6?) This precedure i think should be done with every civ in time as we eriticate thier exsistance.  Once we have a foothod, we can send our forces and conquer!  <br />
<br />
We need Polytheism!!   I would think we can get it without giving up philosophy.  I encourage getting everything u can from whoever, w/o giving up the key techs  (philosophy, mathmatics)<br />
I think The wheel should be a pick up for sure, along with iron working.   HMMMM I hope the Indians like us.</div></div><hr />
