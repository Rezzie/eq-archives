<br />
I've got 97865 culture points and will have a culture victory in about 4 turns.<br />
<br />
I just discovered the Laser and can build the last piece of the space ship in 2 turns.<br />
<br />
I will complete the UN next turn.<br />
<br />
Which way is the best to win, culture, space ship or UN victory?<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />

But if you wanna be different then the common GOTM player I'd suggest diplomatic. :cool: Certainly not cultural.</div></div><hr />

Matrix surely knows how to encourage players. ;)  Don't listen to him, denyd!  You can still win medals!  Always have faith in yourself.  :crazyeye:</div></div><hr />

Not a great deal more but every point counts.<br />
