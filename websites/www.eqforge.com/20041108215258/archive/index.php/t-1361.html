<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morten Blaabjerg</div><div class="date">Apr 10, 2001, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again, an old tip, but I post this because I think it may come in handy for others who haven't read Leon Marricks excellent paper on scenario design.<br />
<br />
I had the problem of all other players cities looking like bronze age monoliths, when they were supposed to be something else in the rules.txt.<br />
<br />
I qoute from Leons article :<br />
<br />
&quot;You can make your pre-industrial cities look correct.<br />
	As you will discover by using the &quot;Cheat&quot; menu to switch the human-controlled civilization, only one civilization in each game (the one initially chosen) is certain to have the correct pre-industrial city style if played by a human.  You have to live with all of your cities looking like Bronze Age Monoliths if you do not play the initially chosen civilization.  This can be remedied by:<br />
1.  Making a copy of your savegame or scenario,<br />
2.  opening up the file in Write (Do not use Word, etc.)<br />
3.  changing the second character before each leader's name near the top of the scenario file to the ASCII character in position one for classical cities, two for far eastern cities, and three for medieval cities.  Let me make this a copy-and-paste task for you by supplying you with the characters:<br />
The character after this colon will yield Classical-style cities:_<br />
The character after this colon will yield Eastern-style cities:_<br />
The character after this colon will yield Medieval-style cities:_<br />
4.  saving the file in text-only format, with the &quot;SAV&quot; or &quot;SCN&quot; suffix left unchanged.  Macintosh users may have to drag the resulting file to the Civ2 game, or restore the proper type and creator information.&quot;<br />
<br />
Yours Truly,<br />
