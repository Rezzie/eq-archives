&quot;Do you worry that you're not liked <br />
How long till you break <br />
You're happy cause you smile <br />
But how much can you fake&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;My mother's always tried to change herself<br />
She never learned to let things be<br />
She doesn't know how bad she messed me up<br />
Cause now she seems so fake to me<br />
But I love her&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When shadows paint the scenes<br />
Where spotlights used to fall<br />
And I'm left wondering<br />
Is it really worth it all?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Have you ever thought about your soul and can it be saved?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wentu</div><div class="date">Nov 25, 2000, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In our last game we tried to avoid nuclear war. For a long time all civs could build manatthan project but noone did. As soos as Viks discovered rocketry, i saw in 3 consecutive windows : they discover rocketry, they start to build MProj., they have nearly completed MProject. The next turn they had completed it.<br />
<br />
How can u avoid a nucear war in these cases ?<br />
<br />
( BTW, the following war was very funny and we won it. Emperor level )<br />
<br />
bye</div></div><hr />

I started at the easiest level, chose the Aztecs and played on Earth.<br />
<br />
I got nuclear technology just before 0AD.  I got nukes shortly after that.  I quit the game without actually going to war.  I just wanted to see if I could do it.<br />
