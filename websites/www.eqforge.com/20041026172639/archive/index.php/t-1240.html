<br />
In Civ2 classic, is it possible to edit any of the rules files to create a new Wonder? <br />
<br />
Specifically, I would like to create a Space Platform that would serve as an SDI defense in every city.  The idea is to bypass SDI as a city improvement.  I'd make the cost 500 -- although I'm open to suggestions -- and the tech prerequisite Space Flight (SFl).<br />
<br />
I'd also like to create a city improvement, namely a hospital.  It would be available once any civilization discovers Genetic Engineering and would duplicate the effects of the Cure for Cancer wonder in individual cities.  Any tips on how to do that and how much it ought to cost?<br />
<br />
Btw, I'm not concerned with graphics, sounds, etc.; I play a streamlined game without any of the extras.<br />

I think you can only rename, and give a new icon.  Can't really change their properties that much.  Sorry.  Sounds like a good idea though. <br />

You are right on target. Don, you can be creative but there are limitations. Review some of the parameters of the other wonders and see if that helps you decide which one you would want to rename. You might be surprise what you can come up with.<br />
<br />
By the way, you can direct questions about rules.txt and other files to the &quot;Scenario Creation&quot; thread.<br />
