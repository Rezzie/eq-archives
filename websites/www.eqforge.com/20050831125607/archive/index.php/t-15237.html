<br />
By the 1940's, it was just me, the English and the Indians. I took out the English in the 1950's and all but 1 Indian city in the 1970's. I had a was researching the laser (to finish the remaining spaceship component) when, a couple of my cities had a cultural expansion and the game ended with a domination victory.<br />
<br />
My question is. If I had finshed the spaceship, but had not yet launched it, say I wanted to finish the last wonder, when the domination victory ended, would it be legal to reload to the last autosave and launch the spaceship?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spoonman</div><div class="date">Jan 29, 2002, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">no</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I have to agree with Spoonman; as silly as it may seem. I've had more submissions of people who won by domination by accident...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Jan 29, 2002, 07:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whenever the Domination Victory is enabled, everybody should be aware of it and act accordingly. If you want another victory type just don´t expand as much towards the limit.:p <br />
<br />
But never EVER reload, this is one of the main rules of the GOTM. Reloading takes all the fun of learning from mistakes from the game and so it isn´t allowed under whatever gameplay circumstances (except crashes of course ;) ).<br />
<br />
The new random seed event calculator in Civ3 was especially designed by Firaxis to prevent reloading.<br />
<br />
I´d like to have had a conquest victory myself in GOTM, got a domination victory, too.:( <br />
<br />
So NO reloading!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dirty Clint</div><div class="date">Jan 29, 2002, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">no domination victory for me but I did score an accidental culture victory and I only had one spaceship part left to build - boohoo.<br />
That will teach me for taking my eyes off the culture screen for too many turns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ProPain</div><div class="date">Jan 31, 2002, 04:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I posted in the spoiler talks earlier I had an accidental domination victory too. I was ready to permanently change the molecular structure of my computer when it happened because I was so disappointed.:mad: <br />
<br />
But instead of throwing the good old CPU out of the window I accepted my ill fate and submitted my game. You can't reload because you made a mistake or weren''t paying attention enough. I agree with Dirty Clint be more attentive next time (I know I will!)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">denyd</div><div class="date">Jan 31, 2002, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You almost have to count tiles, check each city for a cultural expansion and not build any new cities every turn when you get end game, if you want to launch a spaceship (or just get that last wonder), otherwise you're likely to stumble into a cultural or domitation finish. A LITTLE disappointing, when you've played 3 or 4 hours of micromanagement to get the tech for that last spaceship part, just to have the game end before you can launch.<br />
<br />
Maybe a future GOTM can be one where the only way to win is to play all the way to the 2050AD. Then even if every AI is gone and you've blanketed the world with cities and culture, the game keeps going (talk about a long finish). :crazyeyes :mwaha:</div></div><hr />
