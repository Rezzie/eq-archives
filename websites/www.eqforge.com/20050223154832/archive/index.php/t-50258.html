Please vote for two.  The goals will then be ranked by number of votes, so if techs to choice 1 are not available, the President moves to choice 2, etc.<br />
<br />
Some are longer-term goals that require some techs on the way.  Others are techs we already have prerequisites for and might be important to have in their own right.  Not able to check the utility to map what techs will actually be offered at the moment.  Can someone else provide that info?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit:   sorry, I just saw the &quot;vote for 2&quot; comment.  If you have to reduce me to 2 votes I'd say Trade and Pottery (eliminating my votes for Philo and Astro) since they're the more immediate needs.</div></div><hr />

Trade was a close third in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zelig</div><div class="date">Apr 13, 2003, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Philosophy first, then Pottery, since we can build the Colosus and then switch to the HG, and I doubt that the Colosus is going to be completed before we get to Pottery, even if we get Philosophy first.</div></div><hr />

Having the HG makes expanding a lot easier.<br />
<br />
Philosophy, pottery and trade are by far the most important techs to get so I would have liked to be able to make three choices in the poll.</div></div><hr />

Added Pottery to the poll and removed Tim's extra votes. Pottery wasnt' there :confused: I know I meant to.  My apologies, I was in a hurry (as usual).  So we have a tie, and seems our Queen made the tie-breaker by choosing Mysticism over Trade (or was Trade not available?).  Any last minute votes could break the tie...</div></div><hr />

We had the choice of Myst and Lit. iirc Myst increases the benefit of temples so I went for that.</div></div><hr />

Trade wasn't available, which is what I wanted to go for. We had the choice of Myst and Lit. iirc Myst increases the benefit of temples so I went for that. I believe you're correct.  Good choice :thumbsup:</div></div><hr />
