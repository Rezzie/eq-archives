<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">andvruss</div><div class="date">Oct 21, 2004, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I recently discovered that I had conuterstrike: source on my computer. It had come with the video card that I purchased for around 100 American, including halflife 2, and all the other such Valve games. In order to play this, I needed to update my drviers. I did this, and played CS:S because it is awesome:D. I went back to play Call of Duty and COD:UO but the game freezes around 3 minutes in! My whole comp locks up. Ive reinstalled both, no luck. Also, I went to the ATI website and followed the directions concerning this issue of OpenGL game and Punkbuster with 4.10, and that didn't work. What do I now: Uninstall 4.10 and not play CS:S and other such games, keep 4.10 and not play COD, COD:UO and other such games, or uninstall and keep on installing these drivers when I play each game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.  Download the drivers to your hard drive and save them.  Also make sure that the folder C:\ATI is deleted or cleaned of all prior driver versions.  You have to do that manually.<br />
2.  Download and install DriverCleaner. (Google)<br />
3.  Uninstall all current ATI drivers.<br />
4.  Restart when prompted to restart.  Hit F8 after the BIOS screen flashes and choose SafeMode.<br />
5.  Cancel out of any hardware wizard or &quot;new device found&quot; installation prompts.<br />
6.  Run DriverCleaner and remove all of the ATI driver files.<br />
7.  Restart your computer and boot normally.<br />
8.  Cancel out of any hardware wizards again.<br />
9.  Install new ATI drivers.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have the latest DirectX version and Windows is fully updated.  Make sure your games are fully patched.</div></div><hr />
