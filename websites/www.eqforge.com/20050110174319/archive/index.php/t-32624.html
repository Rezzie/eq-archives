<br />
I've gotten used to it over the months I've had it and I like it a lot more than Microsoft Interent Explorer (I'm using 5 point something now) and I'm just trying to see if there is a way I can use MSN Explorer with another ISP.  Please help, I'm very depressed. :cry:  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pillager</div><div class="date">Sep 23, 2002, 02:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, IE6 here.<br />
<br />
I don't suppose that helps...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Sep 23, 2002, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure you can use it with a different ISP. My Windows XP came with MSN Explorer installed on it after I did a clean re-install.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucky</div><div class="date">Sep 23, 2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, our XP has it too. But pretty big to transfer the whole file. <br />
It should be somewhere on the Windows XP CD.<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Sep 23, 2002, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But whether it is the same MSN Explorer as you use and if it works without MSN as an ISP, I cannot say. I deleted the link and possibly uninstalled or deleted it from my system. I think it is 10 or 11 Megs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Becka</div><div class="date">Sep 23, 2002, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm practically sure I can use MSN Exloperer with another ISP, but the question as to how is my problem :(  I really like MSN Explorer because of the way it handles my Hotmail (I don't have to go to the actual Hotmail site and when I get a message from say CFC because somebody replied to a thread and I click the link I don't get that utterly idiotic &quot;You are visiting a site outside of Hotmail.  To return to Hotmail, close this browser window&quot; banner on the new window :mad: :mad: :mad: ).  IE has a few things going for it, but it doesn't display as much of the page as MSN Explorer did so there is more scrolling. :(<br />
<br />
I guess I'll just wait until my account with MSN expires then try and fool with it, because right now when I'm signed in with my new ISP and I try and sign in, it's trying to connect me with MSN again, I think.</div></div><hr />
