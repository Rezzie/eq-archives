<br />
Things to consider:<br />
Maybe we should build another trireme? RF? It was never decided to bring any trireme back, so I let both of them to continue to explore.<br />
<br />
We haven't made any other contact than with the Aztecs and the Indians?<br />
<br />
Indians are researching writing and we have writing. Still, we can't give it to them because they want Philosophy and Astronomy, which we don't want to give them yet (we can give them astronomy now though).<br />
<br />
We're ready to complete Cop's next turn.<br />
<br />
Pop hut east of Ten? We've been lucky so far with the huts, but it could be barbarians.<br />
<br />
Almost all cities are building caravans now, we probably should switch in some of them? Should we consider temple in a few cities (Igl, FW, VM, PB)?<br />
<br />
What's the priority for settlers? Connection roads? Trade increasing roads? Irrigation? Get them on a boat ASAP?<br />
<br />
Shall we road down to BS! site first, or shall we settle first? I think connection roads are important, so that's what I've used them for mostly.<br />
<br />
Shall we irrigate outside VM, after the road is built? The city kind of lack good food squares (except the fish).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 14, 2003, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few observations:<br />
<br />
I think RF and probably Igloria (there is a trireme not very far from it though) should switch to triremes. The triremes we have should continue exploring. Igloria should switch to the forest square to speed up trireme production. We will then send 1 or probably 2 of our settlers to found C5/C6 and C7. We should pop the hut. The trireme should then continue exploring, we really want to know what that island/continent looks like, we probably want to found at least one city (C7) there soon, it's also close to the Aztecs so the cities there can send some crusaders to the Aztecs a few centuries from now :D.<br />
<br />
Some of the cities producing caravans should switch to settlers so we can expand. Once we settle other continents we should build several warriors to intimidate the AI so we can successfully demand tribute before switching to republic.<br />
<br />
I don't think we urgently need temples since soon we'll have Mike - an Elvis or two is not the end of the world.<br />
<br />
It's taking forever to irrigate the Neu city square. The settler we are getting in EF should immediately road the forest square between EF and LP. I'd like to build an elephant somewhere (probably in Neu) and move it to EF. It can then defend LP, EF and Neu. It wouldn't surpriese me if the military advisor agreed.<br />
<br />
We should build a road all the way to the BS city site and the settler should then found BS.<br />
<br />
A healthy mix of irrigating, roading and founding colonies is what we should aim for. Trade increasing roads near Dou in particular and founding cities.<br />
<br />
Dou should immediately finish Cope, then start a marketplace and RB it a few (maybe 5) turns from now. If we can afford it I'd like to get trade routes up and running ASAP in Dou.<br />
<br />
A lot I'd like to do and so limited resources. But centuries from now we'll be rich. Rich, rich. rich...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">naervod</div><div class="date">May 15, 2003, 11:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we should build another trireme, as I am a huge advocate of exploring as much as possible in the early game so I can have an easy late game in terms of conquest. The reason we haven't made contact is because we need to explore! Let's do it! Also, the continent east of the Aztec continent looks to have signs of improvements on it, so there is probably a civ there.<br />
<br />
I would suggest holding off on giving the Indians Astronomy until they have a tech we need.<br />
<br />
I would go for popping the hut, although we should be prepared if it is barbs. Also, if it is barbs, we can build the new city Barbs Suck near the site of the hut.<br />
<br />
We should probably switch some cities to temples, but always keep a certain fraction of our cities on cravans. Maybe we could have a caravan rotation, where the cities switched on and off of building caravans and other stuff.<br />
<br />
I am in favor of having our cities grow fast, so most of our settlers should irrigate. We should have some on the rest, with one or two on a trireme to another continent. We should do a connection road to BS definitely, then settle. We should irrigate VM definitely. I cannot stress the improtance of city growth to get our production moving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">funxus</div><div class="date">May 16, 2003, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The improvements you can see east of the Aztecs are made by the french.  The improvement seen between Aztecs and Indians are made by Zulus.<br />
<br />
The indians have three techs, and one is Iron working that we want for bridgebuilding. Now that we're researching monotheism, shall we try to exchange construction and IW to be able to get BB, or have we decided upon republic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheViking</div><div class="date">May 16, 2003, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We should aim for republic ASAP so we can switch to it the moment we complete Mike. That's also the reason I generally prefer irrigation to roads, except near Dou and where we need to connect cities for military reasons (example: Igloria). I want us to be ready to start WLTP almost immediately after switching to republic (WLTP may need to be preceded by a few turns of maximum taxes so we can RB needed stuff in our cities).<br />
<br />
That said, BB would still be really useful, both for trade and connection roads near Dou and Neu. And we need harbors in FW and LP, meaning we need seafaring as well.</div></div><hr />
