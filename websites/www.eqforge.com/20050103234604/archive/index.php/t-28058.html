<br />
Ok, I decided to save about 90 bucks and go for the $68 GeForce MX instead of getting the Ti...so sue me. :) I feel that the performance increase I would see between the two would have been minimal anyways plus since I spent less than 70 bucks, including shipping, I can upgrade other things on my system....like my weary Duron 750. Poor things...I demand much of it and it needs a break. A nice AMD XP 1900 should fit nicely in my computer along with a new mobo and some new DDR ram...I might go with 1Gig of it. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Jul 26, 2002, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent choice, PH.  I picked up the GeForce 4 MX 440 to replace my TNT2 a month or two ago and it kicks mucho asso.  You'll notice a huge difference, particularly in large 3d environments like in Grand Theft Auto 3.  Ironically enough, GTA3 was the game that finally got me off my ass to buy a new graphics card.  Try playing it on anything less than a GeForce 3, and you'll know what I mean.</div></div><hr />

But I don't play that much 3D games, Need for Speed 3 is the only one and it works perfect with this videocard. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Cool Blue....The G400 is about equal in power to a TNT 2 and I am going to a GF4 MX 420 which is a little slower than your 440 model but I got the DDR model which was 2 bucks more than the non-DDR model....Just curious, is your MX 440 DDR? (I didn't even know they had DDR MXes until I went to buy it).<br />

64 MB!! Wow, I guess I should finally upgrade the computer I'm working on now. It has a cutting edge 4 MB rage graphics card :o</div></div><hr />

They could spare more money and invest in a fully powerful card such as a Parhelia or a GF4 Ti4400. Instead of buying such a &quot;castrated&quot; diminished video card...<br />
I'm still pleased with my R7500 DDR but if I had to change I'll never ever buy a blabla with the 2 letters &quot;MX&quot; next to it. Cheap price, cheap performance (compared to high end cards of course)</div></div><hr />

GF4 MX = Best bang for the buck if you go performance per monetary unit. And I bet that my card is as fast as yours and is cheaper still....plus I can turn on AA with very little hit and I have Hardware T&amp;L...does yours? (it might, just not sure)<br />

Anyway, there has been a long time I haven't heard from you. Glad to see you back here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BlueMonday</div><div class="date">Aug 03, 2002, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You haven't seen me because I only visit this forum anymore.  I've abandoned the OT and its incessant whining perpetrated by group of self-appointed political experts...again ;)  Looks like you got some work cut out for you.  Only 3655 posts?  A sad day when the likes of PH can out post you.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Aug 03, 2002, 05:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heee I see you have been hibernating too :D<br />
I gave up for a long time. Actually I'm almost like you, lurking and only posting sometimes, on All other games and Humor. Seldom on that one. According to what you said (and it was quite true unfortunately), I too stand clear from OT and other forums. I  don't post actively anymore. The end of an era eh? A spammer has gone/died, another one is born. My steed ;):D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">munzy</div><div class="date">Aug 03, 2002, 07:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">(groan) More of the lame horse jokes....NEHHEEEE! ;)<br />
<br />
Well, this spammer has slowed down also. Darky and Delly will be taking the reins soon. Starlifter will probably be the master spammer since philippe seems to have slowed down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got a nice GeForce4 Ti 4200 for just $150....I'm very happy with it.... :D<br />
<br />
The main reason I think it's worth the extra money is that is has full DirectX 8 support.  GeForce4 MX's are DX7 cards, so you could actually get better performance, and probably for the same price, out of a GeForce3 Ti.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">GenghisK</div><div class="date">Aug 25, 2002, 04:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's a clever guy :goodjob:<br />
Investing more for a non castratated GF4.<br />
Now the reason why I prefer ATI to nVicia is just because ATI is more versatile, although less powerful. I mean they have a lot of multimedia hardware coded features... And the RV300 is to be released soon :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
That one rules.  Just look at some comments from benchmarkers!!!<br />
<br />
&quot;Thanks to advanced compression technology, I'm able to pull even more polygons per second out of Mi-A55.&quot; <br />
&quot;It'll take years before PC games are able to pump everything they can out of Mi-A55.&quot; <br />
&quot;I tried several 3D accelerators, but Mi-A55 blew them all away.&quot; <br />
&quot;Engineers shoved an extra-wide bus into Mi-A55.&quot; <br />
