<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144395854">Persoanlly, I enjoyed solo&#39;ing until about lvl 15 or so.  If you&#39;re having<br/>
trouble finding groups out there, try getting bound in Rivervale and<br/>
hhunting in Paw.  It&#39;s usually less populated than the other &quot;main&quot; areas<br/>
(ie: Crushbone, Blackburrow, Mino tunnels) but folks (at least on The Rathe)<br/>
seemed to be more group-oriented.  Rarely did I go in there and NOT get<br/>
asked to group.<br/>
Also, this place will keep the exp coming til you hit lvl13 or 14.<br/>
