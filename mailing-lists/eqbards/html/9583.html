&gt; mere<br/>
&gt; &gt; examination of the body would count as a loot? Imagine being attacked while<br/>
&gt; &gt; trying to loot your ghoulbane *ouch*..<br/>

&gt; I can&#39;t think of any occasion where we&#39;ve killed something,<br/>
&gt; been able to examine it, but died/had to leave before we could<br/>
&gt; loot it.<br/>

loot it and get whacked... dosen&#39;t that make you stand up again? did<br/>
that count as your one chance to loot?</div>
