<div id="ygrps-yiv-566412029">Well I got my copies of Velious today from EBWorld, and I went home at lunch<br/>
and installed them.  Be ready for about a 6.5mb Scars patch on top of the<br/>
patch everyone else is receiving.  <br/>
<br/>
I am definitely looking forward to getting home this afternoon, exploring<br/>
new zones and looking for new songs!<br/>
