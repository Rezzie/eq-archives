&gt; &gt;Since the new patch, a good piercer worth looking into is the dragoon<br/>
&gt; &gt;dagger, it is a lore item but very nice stats of...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; CB??? This dagger is in CB???  You&#39;re kidding, right??<br/>
&gt; Where??? Who???<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They took DVinn&#39;s &quot;ornate dagger&quot; and changed it into the<br/>
&quot;dragoon dirk.&quot;  If you had saved the former as a souvenier,<br/>
it is now the latter.<br/>
<br/>
My L18-20 friends and I just went to Crushbone and killed<br/>
DVinn a five times and got one for each of us.  We didn&#39;t even<br/>
have to camp him - people camping Crush were training Dvinn to<br/>
the zone, so we just killed him at the zone.<br/>
<br/>
It is very nice, and at 2.5 pounds doesn&#39;t eat up my stamina<br/>
like my barbed whip did.<br/>
