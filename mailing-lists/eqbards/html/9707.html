i have sent several messages to the owners of the other bard mailing lists and i am patiently waiting for replys from any of them.  one list i know is dead, the only messages they have had for the past 4 months are mine, and the the other list has just over 100 members many of whom are members here. if any of you would like to see the list join together please let the moderator of the eq-bards know, this can only help our forum grow stronger<br/>
