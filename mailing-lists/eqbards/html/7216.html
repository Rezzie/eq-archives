<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412048893">eq.castersrealm.com says you can charm pets after the owner<br/>
has been killed.  Still not perfect, but better than not being<br/>
able to charm at all.  Apparently this is aimed at PvP, where<br/>
magicians were being annoyed by bards and enchanters charming<br/>
(and instakilling with invisibility) their pets.<br/>
