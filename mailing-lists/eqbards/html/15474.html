 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d have to agree that grouping is best.  4c&#39;s or AoF in Cazic works well<br/>
too, assuming it&#39;s not crowded and you have as many pulls as you want.  4C&#39;s<br/>
is probably the safest place to fight of anywhere I&#39;ve found.  There aren&#39;t<br/>
many roamers and there are numerous static mobs that you can pull when<br/>
ready.  Set up by the stairs behind Archon&#39;s Temple and pull to there.<br/>
