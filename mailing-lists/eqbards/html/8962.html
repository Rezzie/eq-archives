&gt;I really blame things like this more on Verant than twinkers.<br/>
&gt;The crested spaulders are the common drop from the mob that<br/>
&gt;drops the crested helm.  The helm is highly sought after, thus<br/>
&gt;producing many extraneous crested spaulders, which are either<br/>
&gt;sold, traded, twinked, given away, or worse (if you&#39;ve ever<br/>
&gt;wondered why the banker was wielding thulian claws, this is<br/>
&gt;why - the claws are the common drop for the rubi breastplate). </span></blockquote></div>
