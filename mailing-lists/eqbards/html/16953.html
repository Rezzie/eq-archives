<div id="ygrps-yiv-118849780">Taunt on the orb is huge, and it goes off a lot.  Great weapon when there&#39;s<br/>
no enchanter around though.<br/>

Early bardic life a procing weapon is good.  I&#39;m told that in a bard&#39;s late<br/>
life you don&#39;t want the additional taunt of a proc.  At level 45 I&#39;m duel<br/>
wielding Ykesha&#39;s or a Ykesha and a Kisch.  Every 50th level bard I know<br/>
tells me that what I&#39;m really going to want short of planes weapons is an<br/>
orb or duel EBWs so I can still damage without the taunt.  We&#39;ll see :)</div>
