I have read a lot of debate about if bard should or shouldn&#39;t be allowed to<br/>
wear banded.  Here is my opinion if anyone cares.  If you disagree with<br/>
banded don&#39;t wear it.. (simple as that) there are so many other options for<br/>
those of you who disagree with banded.. don&#39;t make such a big fuss, just<br/>
don&#39;t wear it...do something else.  <br/>
And for those who agree with banded then strap it on.....<br/>
Please don&#39;t make a mountain out of a mole hill...... HEHE<br/>
Enjoy the game, and enjoy being a bard because in my opinion the bard class<br/>
is the best class in Norrath....<br/>
