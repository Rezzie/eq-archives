<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084698998">Unfortunatly only the Monks can use magic gloves and have the ability to<br/>
punch magic only creatures.  It would be very nice if we had that ability.<br/>
I have done a lot of punching while using and instrument.  Also it is not<br/>
so.<br/>

I may be mistaken but I have elf-hide gloves and cannot punch a wisp for<br/>
damage.<br/>
So magic gloves are not the cure to punching magic critters.<br/>
BTW at 19 my H2H is maxed and it still sucks. Might have something to do<br/>
with only getting 3/level. I hear a lot of people say bards get 4 per or 5<br/>
per. Trust me... We get 3.</div>
