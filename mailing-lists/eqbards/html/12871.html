<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147163695"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; PS Still a possible workaround but probably not worth the effort, especially<br/>
&gt; if a high level bard is available to go on the raid.  What a lower level<br/>
&gt; bard could do is /duel a 50 level player who can cast root.  Assuming root<br/>
&gt; sticks, bard doesn&#39;t have to worry about fleeing.  Not certain how long a<br/>
&gt; dragon raid takes so bard would most likely have to get rooted several times<br/>
&gt; throughout the battle.  Doubt the high level players would want to take the<br/>
&gt; risk though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Fear does some funny things.<br/>
<br/>
  Fear removes Wolfform and SoW, I would imagine that Fear would also<br/>
  cancel Root (on a player).  If you cast fear on a rooted npc it simply<br/>
  ignores it.<br/>
<br/>
  I cannot confirm this, as it&#39;s never happened to me.  But most of<br/>
  the people I speak with say that Fear definitely cancels movement<br/>
  enhancing spells.  Again, this could be hearsay.  But I heard it,<br/>
  so I&#39;m saying it ;)<br/>
