<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052272512">General call for the following information:<br/>
1) Are there currently any bards using any two-handed weapons (slashing or<br/>
blunt)?<br/>
2) Are there any Bards who have had any luck with advancing their<br/>
hand-to-hand skill, and if so, how, and how far?<br/>
<br/>
This was brought to my attention by someone who pointed out that, although<br/>
we have the skills listed on our &quot;training sheet&quot; we can&#39;t actually train<br/>
any two-handers.<br/>
