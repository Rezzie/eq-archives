&gt; That last email conversation reminded me of a young Harmonic<br/>
&gt; and a &#39;snooty&#39; Shada.  I started laughing, after I thought<br/>
&gt; about it some more.  Keep heart young level 22 bard who <br/>
&gt; thinks I&#39;m on a high horse.  I was right where you were <br/>
&gt; not so long ago.  =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ( And now I have utmost respect for Shada, go figure ;p )<br/>

&gt; Harmonic, only STR 109, high horser, god? </span></blockquote></div>
