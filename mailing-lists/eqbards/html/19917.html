&gt; &gt; Maybe it was 8 gold or so but they were concerned that <br/>
&gt; teleporting classes<br/>
&gt; &gt; could use the quest to get rich quick?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Think about it, the fastest way to do this would be a Wizard <br/>
&gt; (with JBoots)<br/>
&gt; porting to West Karana, or maybe a druid porting from North Karana<br/>
&gt; considering high level SoW or Scale of Wolf sould toast <br/>
&gt; JBoots. Even at that<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s several minutes for 8gold and faction, I imagine not a <br/>
&gt; lot of mail will<br/>
&gt; be flowing along that route.<br/>
