<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246480880">Sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to imply that your suggestion was<br/>
wrong/foolish/whatever...  I hate having a song I never use, so I am hoping<br/>
people dispell my thoughts on it...  As it is, I am having trouble thinking<br/>
of a situation where I would use it.  Without the dam shield, I would use it<br/>
all the time (I often feel it is my job to mitigate damage more than help<br/>
the group deal it, since there are many more damage dealing classes out<br/>
there).  I can&#39;t think of a scenario where I would use it.<br/>
<br/>
I feel the same way about Song of Dawn, I can&#39;t remember the last I died due<br/>
to bard hate.  Pretty much when I die, its because we couldn&#39;t get a mob off<br/>
the enchanter or cleric.  But that is a discussion for next month...</div>
