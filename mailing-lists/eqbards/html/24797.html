<div id="ygrps-yiv-226938273">How are people getting the white scales on your server?  Is anyone killing<br/>
the scale master?  On my server Vox and Nagafen are killed within hours of<br/>
poping.  The white scale is defently the HUGE bottle neck on my server.  How<br/>
about yours?<br/>

Yup, I am on all the lists I can find.  5 more months at sea then I can play<br/>
eq again.<br/>
