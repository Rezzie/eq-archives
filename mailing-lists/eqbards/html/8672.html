&gt; where I can<br/>
&gt; begin to buy some steel armor to replace my ugly bronze until <br/>
&gt; I can start<br/>
&gt; moving forward to Lambent so does anyone know if I can find <br/>
&gt; size &quot;medium&quot;<br/>
&gt; steel plate armor for sale in either Freeport or Qeynos?  I <br/>
&gt; know it is sold<br/>
&gt; in Kelethin but I am not sure if you can find it at these <br/>
&gt; other cities.<br/>
