<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-123027476">On the IRC network of StarChat, I have created a channel for the live<br/>
gathering of bards of the realms. The channel name is: EverQuestBards. It is<br/>
just a tavern gathering. for the goal of good talk and friendship. A place<br/>
to share with others and enjoy the company of other bards.<br/>
<br/>
	I hope to have a drink with you all, and share a story or two...</div>
