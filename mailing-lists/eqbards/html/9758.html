<br/>
In most every situation I feel as if I have some mobility, some control.  But every<br/>
time I go to lower Guk I must ask for an invisible to undead.  The new undead in<br/>
Kithicor make an ITU song even more attractive.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And an observation : our higher-level direct damage songs (with the exception of the<br/>
dirge) are pretty lame.  I memorize one from time to time in an easy area but they<br/>
are just not that useful =(.  On the other hand, the useful ones are so wonderful<br/>
