[ 8-12]/19 = 0.421 - 0.632<br/>

If you parse your files, I suspect you&#39;ll find the claw is<br/>
actually doing more damage over time than the whip.  It will<br/>
become even better as you pass level 20, since there&#39;s a<br/>
level-based constant added to your primary weapon damage -<br/>
that favors faster weapons.<br/>
