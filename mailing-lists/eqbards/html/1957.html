<div id="ygrps-yiv-495611484">Ok, in Oasis?  Head south through the pass, perhaps stop off at a few<br/>
dervish camps for derverision.  Head to SW corner, enter Innothule, hand<br/>
left, and visit lovely Guk, so beautiful this time of year.  Course, I had<br/>
fun for a while at the bottom of Oasis lake killing aqua goblins, but you&#39;re<br/>
probably too high level now, as am I.<br/>
<br/>
If you take all the advice and head west to the Karanas, well, you&#39;ll soon<br/>
enough get bored more than likely.  If you have a few magic weapons, I&#39;d<br/>
recommend jaunting through Blackburrow to Everfrost Peaks.  There&#39;s<br/>
something there, something very interesting.  When you find the frozen<br/>
river, look for a break in the ice, and get aquatic ayre ready.  Bring a few<br/>
people with you, and swim north, up the river (Here&#39;s where you see how<br/>
brave those barbarians really are!).  Eventually you&#39;ll come up to a dry<br/>
cavern, a maze, and you should find a few Ice Boned Skeletons to slaughter.<br/>
Stack guardian and elemental when you tangle with them, and carefully<br/>
explore.  What an infernal place hidden under those peaks!  Be warned, I<br/>
only explored alone and don&#39;t know much of it, but I do know I saw a one<br/>
Sulon McMoor, who looked quite deadly.<br/>
