<div id="ygrps-yiv-577289806">Musiker!  I haven&#39;t seen you on recently.  No, you don&#39;t know me, but I<br/>
&#39;spy&#39; on my fellow Bards on Bertoxx, just to see if there&#39;s been any<br/>
attrition from nerfs, announcements etc.<br/>

I usually do a quick /who all bard to see who&#39;s on.  More for a boost in<br/>
self-esteem than anything else.  I actually like to see  high level Bards.<br/>
It gives me something to aim for.<br/>
