<div id="ygrps-yiv-2138707068">i&#39;ve heard something lately about a datarate.txt file in the EQ directory.<br/>
supposedly it is set at 5.0 which means you can handle 5k/sec of data or<br/>
something.  maybe someone knows more, but alterring this some has kept<br/>
people from going LD on big raids, though i can&#39;t remember if it is<br/>
increasing or decreasing that number.<br/>
