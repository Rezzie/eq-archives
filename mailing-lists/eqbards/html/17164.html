<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967491060">My current pasttime is pulling in Fear.  Find something to pull, bring it<br/>
back near the group, if there&#39;s more than one then run in circles<br/>
alternating selo&#39;s and chains till one (chain) sticks.  Then call out to<br/>
the puller that one will be lagging behind the rest, let them pick it off,<br/>
and keep running in circles till they&#39;re ready for more.<br/>
<br/>
Heck of a lot more fun than the alternative.<br/>
