that was like. Without a doubt, twas not my bag.  Not that I had a bad<br/>
experience - no one killed me - but I was very nervous all the time,<br/>
watching over my shoulder for the backstabbing PKers that I just KNEW were<br/>
lurking around the corner.  I spent more time as a zone warrior,  because<br/>
that way, at least I&#39;d have a shot at getting away.  Not enjoyable.  Then<br/>
to discover that my 2nd level song is utterly useless because it&#39;s hitting<br/>
everyone around me, and not just the monsters *aaagh*<br/>
I decided to take a break from PvP.  <br/>
Maybe when the racewar server comes online, I&#39;ll try it.<br/>
