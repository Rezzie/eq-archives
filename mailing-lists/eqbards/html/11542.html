<div id="ygrps-yiv-332295618"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Both Fear and Hate planes have been enhanced, in terms of how often loot is<br/>
&gt; dropped by NPCs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When Verant calls this an &quot;enhancement&quot;, god only knows what it really means. Does this mean items will be<br/>
dropped more or less often?If anyone who&#39;s going to fear or hate tonight can check it out and get back to<br/>
me on this, that&#39;d be great.<br/>
