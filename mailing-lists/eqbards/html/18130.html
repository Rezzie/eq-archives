<div id="ygrps-yiv-7311945">Snakeskin tunic has strong poison resist stats, as much armor with ac as you<br/>
can, a snake fang necklace (made by NPC Menkes Tolbite in South Qeynos - I<br/>
used to have him make dozens of these and truck over to Freeport area - good<br/>
to sell for a couple plat each.)  And then lots and lots of bandages for<br/>
those times when you kill the snake but almost die from the poison.  Also<br/>
potions of healing can be purchased - not sure if a light heal is worth<br/>
10pp+ but hey...<br/>

&gt; Heh.  My tale isn&#39;t nearly so grand.  I died in E Commons when I made the<br/>
&gt; silly mistake of attacking a blue conning asp with a newly twinked rogue<br/>
&gt; thinking I might survive the battle.  Silly rogue.<br/>
