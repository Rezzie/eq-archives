hybrid group&quot;  I had had so much fun with in Karnor&#39;s.  (Mine was 2 rangers,<br/>

in a karnor&#39;s pickup group (which is to say pretty bad, I hate that<br/>
place...).<br/>

&gt; err, that&#39;s not an all hybrid group.  that&#39;s 2 hybrids (you, ranger) and 3<br/>
&gt; pure melee (warrior, 2 monks).  you were killing things so fast because<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; had the 3 pure melee high damage dealers.  it was, as you say, and all<br/>
tank<br/>
&gt; group though.<br/>
