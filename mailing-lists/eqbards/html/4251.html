Human language has always evolved to meet specific needs. In this case,   <br/>
forcing people to communicate in real time using typed input REQUIRES   <br/>
abbreviated forms of speech.  For example, to me &quot;RTS&quot; *is* the   <br/>
designator for the object. Calling it a &quot;Runed Totem Staff&quot; would like   <br/>
needing to say &quot;my 1997 dark red Saturn SL&quot; everytime I wanted to say &quot;my   <br/>
car&quot; in a conversation.<br/>
