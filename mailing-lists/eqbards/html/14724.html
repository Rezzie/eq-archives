<div id="ygrps-yiv-627827588">This reminds me, has any level 50 with a Selo&#39;s drum tried to outrun<br/>
shadowmen?<br/>
I&#39;ve been meaning to try, but never think of it when I&#39;m in a shadowmen<br/>
zone.  It seemed like it was a close race with a MM drum, but I&#39;m wondering<br/>
if the Selo&#39;s drum can restore our title of &quot;fastest thing in norrath&quot;<br/>

  [connecting to shadowmen thread] This is how a bard can outrun<br/>
  shadowmen.  Selo&#39;s + Screech.  The shadowmen move so fast in the<br/>
  opposite direction that they are out of agro radius within about<br/>
  2 seconds and give up the chase.  So if someone asks you if you<br/>
  can outrun shadowmen, you can if you are creative.  Just twist<br/>
  Selos and Screech and take off.<br/>

  Harmonic.</div>
