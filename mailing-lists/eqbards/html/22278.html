<b>Subject:</b> My first Hate raid <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-437662674">I just wanted to drop everyone a first message about my first Hate raid.  I<br/>
experienced no deaths, and in fact there were only about 8 deaths the whole<br/>
evening (5 of which were on the break-in).  I was the only bard up there and<br/>
had the honor of looting an imbrued bracer:)<br/>
<br/>
Some of you guys warned about singing while the revenants were being pulled.<br/>
I didnt seem to have any problems at all with creatures agrooing me at all<br/>
during the entire time in Hate.  I went with an instrument combo all<br/>
evening, and some of the group commented that their resist rates against NPC<br/>
spells were higher than normal for a Hate raid.<br/>
<br/>
I also took care of all curing for my party, which allowed our cleric to<br/>
keep more useful spells memmed.<br/>
<br/>
This was just a &quot;fun&quot; raid, and we cleared the entire zone except for those<br/>
areas around Maestro and Inny (who were both up, but our pull team had 3<br/>
members who had to work today and wanted to get to bed).<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least is the fact that my party only got exp on 10 or so kills,<br/>
but I made almost 3&#92;4 of a bubble of exp!  <br/>
