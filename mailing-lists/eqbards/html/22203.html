<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232707285">I have seen a few great tables and charts of experience needed to level, and also articles on how experience is divided based upon level of player and level of mob.<br/>
<br/>
I was looking for them today and I can&#39;t find them :(.<br/>
<br/>
Does someone have some URLs or some information saved somewhere?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
