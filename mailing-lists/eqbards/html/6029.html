<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499446434">I would be the first to humbly agree that dying is greatest reason why I<br/>
cannot level.  Even with Verants change to reduce the amount of xp you<br/>
lose when you die, I still lost 1/3 of  a bubble dying to a stupid<br/>
basement train last night.  At least I got my level, though it took at<br/>
least another to earn it back =(.  Perhaps it is time to be less noble<br/>
and more parts chicken.  It seems that I die more often when trying to<br/>
care people, perhaps it would be better to be known as Treilanin the you<br/>
yellow bellied chicken .... Nah I think not =).<br/>
