<b>Subject:</b> Magical Horn? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1076600283">I know from speaking to some bards in game (i am only level 13) that there are some magical instruments that give added benefits to songs when used... While fighting in steamfont, we killed a slaver while looking for a minotaur axe. The slaver had a minotaur horn which it says a bard can use... my question is does this horn have any magical song effect to it? ie does it make songs better, or is it just a normal horn... Also, does anyone know what skill this uses, brass or wind, or something else?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your help<br/>
