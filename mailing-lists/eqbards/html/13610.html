&gt; Are you having fun playing your 21st shaman? If so then you (jackal) have<br/>
&gt; plenty of things to do to keep you occupied until the expansion comes out.<br/>
&gt; Your shaman still has to suffer from all the problems with the game that IMO<br/>
&gt; need to get fixed.  If you don&#39;t have fun playing anything but your 50 necro<br/>
&gt; then thats a different story.  <br/>

would. I don&#39;t like playing twinks. When I start another character it&#39;s<br/>
on a brand new server. Unfortunately, this means I end up losing touch<br/>
with my old friends on my old server after a while, which means the old<br/>
character ends up not being played very often.<br/>
