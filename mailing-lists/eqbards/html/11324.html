<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789435905">This has been asked over and over I&#39;m sure but..<br/>
<br/>
As a level 20 bard, where is a good place to go? I know<br/>
all about the level chart on AllaKazam&#39;s page, but I&#39;ve<br/>
found it to be seriously flawed so I don&#39;t follow it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
PS: Maybe we could come up with a list or chart for<br/>
bards between all of us..</div>
