<div id="ygrps-yiv-287963138">These ghost faction hits happened to me non-stop on E&#39;ci this past weekend.<br/>
All were negative Mistmoore hits so didn&#39;t really bother me too much.  I<br/>
also saw non-stop messages that nearby mobs were casting spells even though<br/>
they weren&#39;t showing up on tracking.  This was in the Dreadlands near the<br/>
tunnel to FV.  <br/>

One more question:  Does everyone get random faction hits in ROK?  The<br/>
whole time I was there I was getting random faction hits.  I assumed its<br/>
was a bard bug, but the rest of party was getting them too (not at the<br/>
same time, though)<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
