<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524224977">talanic told me to do a &quot;/w 33 60 bard all&quot; the other night and there were<br/>
16 i think.  in my guild there are 4 primary bards over 30: two 60 bards, me<br/>
(57), and a 56.  mith marr is so tweaked on bard drops that we are all in<br/>
full SS, all have BoH, etc.  i think we have 1 twink bard around level 45.<br/>

&gt; 28, 12 and a 7.<br/>
&gt; I did a /who all bard 30 40, /who all bard 41 50, /who all <br/>
&gt; bard 51 60, the<br/>
&gt; other day when there were 2400 people on the server and only <br/>
&gt; came up with a<br/>
&gt; total of about 30 people across all 3 searches. =&#92;  More <br/>
&gt; armor for me I guess!<br/>
