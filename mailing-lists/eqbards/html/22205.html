There *is* a way out of the &quot;box&quot;, though, but requires a druid or <br/>
wizard:<br/>
<br/>
You both have to run to the same corner, and your friend has to make <br/>
sure he/she has no target. You can then play an AOE song and your <br/>
friend will target you. One quick invite later, the gate is on...<br/>
<br/>
Now, the bad part about this was explaining to my friend on the phone <br/>
what happened, and listening to all the group tells while she decided <br/>
if I *really* needed out.<br/>
