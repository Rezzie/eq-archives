&gt; Yep that&#39;s pretty much the way it works.  Cast an AoE which includes Gob A<br/>
&gt; who is in agro range of Gob B.  Gob B sees spell hit Gob A and rushes over<br/>
&gt; to smack you.  Bard songs used to effect everything in range, so if the<br/>
&gt; druid ran thru your radius but was unaffected and he was in the agro radius<br/>
&gt; of Grimfeather, you aided him as far as Grimmy is concerned.<br/>

people killing stuff in my song radius all the time.  I don&#39;t<br/>
get the faction hit all the time.  It&#39;s only once every few<br/>
nights that it happens.<br/>
