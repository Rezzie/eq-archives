<div id="ygrps-yiv-557875119"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well we definatly wouldn&#39;t want to increase the cap to a level above bards,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I&#39;ll be honest with you all.  When I say, stone spider on track, or<br/>
  nox on track, the druids are reporting the same exact thing at the<br/>
  same exact time.  That&#39;s 20 vs. 100.  I wouldn&#39;t mind our tracking<br/>
  cap lower whatsoever, to 75 or even 60.  They could then raise <br/>
  druids to 40.  This is such a non-issue, tracking ranges are <br/>
  not affected greatly by slight skill differences.  A ranger can,<br/>
  however, track Djarn from the bat cave, where I cannot.  So that&#39;s<br/>
  the difference between 100 and 200.  Otherwise, I can see everything<br/>
  else the ranger can.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
