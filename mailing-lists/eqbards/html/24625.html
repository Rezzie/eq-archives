&gt; for the % increase they provide.  You&#39;re not going to find <br/>
&gt; one awesome string instrument that does affect the mana regen <br/>
&gt; portion of Cantana where others do not.  You can simply take <br/>
&gt; a store bought lute, test for any increases and adjust that <br/>
&gt; for all instruments with higher bonuses.  There&#39;s no secrets <br/>
