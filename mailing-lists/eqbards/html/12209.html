<div id="ygrps-yiv-496383087">One thing I noticed when I got to 15 or so, was that I ceased being able to<br/>
&quot;tank&quot;. Not that bards are tanks, but up to that point bards can tank<br/>
somewhat... but the &quot;tanking skills&quot; really never change much from when you<br/>
are in the beginning levels (single digit).<br/>
