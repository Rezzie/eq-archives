<div id="ygrps-yiv-719698051">The Official Everquest Page has some technical guidance for configuring many<br/>
mainstream sound cards.  I have a Soundblaster Live that was functioning<br/>
acceptably well, and then I followed their directions and it is GREAT!  I don&#39;t<br/>
know if you will see such a vast improvement by following their advice, but it<br/>
is probably worth 10 minutes of your time to find out.</div>
