<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092041914">i just built a system, and have a different weird problem i won&#39;t share (yet<br/>
hehe).  do you have directx 7.0 or 7.0a?  if you don&#39;t have 7.0a make sure<br/>
you get that.  you can also go into the multimedia control panel, choose<br/>
advanced properties on your playback device, and move hardware acceleration<br/>
from full to standard (one notch left).  also make sure you have liveware<br/>
3.0 installed from the soundblaster site.<br/>

&gt; I have a problem with system lock ups while playing EQ.  I have a new <br/>
