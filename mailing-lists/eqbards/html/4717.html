&gt;the baby birties.  In SK, you can kill all the chickens you want and they<br/>
&gt;still sell to you (well not me but others - non-hummies I guess.)  But i<br/>
&gt;think eventually they do scowl at you.  My high lev fiends who are killing<br/>
&gt;avocets now said they went KOS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone ever try the Charillion on the ice giants up in Perma?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>About merchants who won&#39;t sell to you but are NOT KOS to you = this is an <br/>
old rogue trick, might even be a bug exploit? I don&#39;t know, J.M I would love <br/>
to hear your opinion on this: You can use the sneak skill to make the aviak <br/>
merchant indifferent to you then you can sell/buy from him.<br/>
