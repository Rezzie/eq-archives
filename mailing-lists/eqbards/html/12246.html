<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053731902">Admit it, the bard quests are much too easy.  I don&#39;t know how many of<br/>
my items I got by just entering a zone, ooc&#39;ing that I needed an item for<br/>
the bard quests, please let me know if you find one, and then walking out<br/>
15 minutes later with the item...</div>
