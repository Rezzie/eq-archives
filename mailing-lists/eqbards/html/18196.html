 </span></blockquote>The AGI/AC debuff is pretty significant, as well.  Between the 45 AGI debuff<br/>
and the AC debuff, I dropped my AC by 62 points when I managed to stick this<br/>
on myself.  My only concern in using this would be if the attack speed<br/>
component overwrote that of a shammie or enchanter (assuming they cast their<br/>
spell first).  Has anyone had a chance to test this yet?  (I imagine no<br/>
one -- including myself -- is in too much of a &quot;testing&quot; mentality right<br/>
now, with so much new territory to explore, heh.)<br/>
