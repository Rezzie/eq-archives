<div id="ygrps-yiv-882774415">He spawns at a specific spot - he has a place holder. I sent spoiler details<br/>
separately. He&#39;s 1 in 5 or so spawn so you can run around A LOT with see<br/>
invis and not see him. Never gonna see him unless his PH is killed.<br/>

Mr. <br/>
		Warden is invisible.  Did you have see invis up while you<br/>
were <br/>
		running around?  If no you prolly ran past him half a dozen<br/>
times =)<br/>
