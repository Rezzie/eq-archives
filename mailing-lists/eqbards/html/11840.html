<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633602458">well i am an old-timer and i always remember needing a cleric.  but every<br/>
story everyone says they don&#39;t need a healer, guess who they mention as<br/>
being in their group?  an enchanter, of course hehe.  they make most tough<br/>
situations doable.<br/>

&gt;   Last night I did bugs/bats in SolB with no healer whatsoever.<br/>
&gt;   Best experience I&#39;ve gotten in a long time.  2 noxs, 1 death<br/>
&gt;   beetle, and no show on guano or stone.  At one point we had<br/>
&gt;   3 bats and 2 ldcs.  A group with a healer would have fled,<br/>
&gt;   but this group finished all the battles at full hp.  How?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   2 paladins, 1 enchanter, 1 bard, 1 monk, 1 wizard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Enchanter does her thing, per usual.  AE mez, AE stun. </span></blockquote></div>
