<div id="ygrps-yiv-691186484">A guildbro of mine was messing around to see how much Dex he could build up<br/>
(buffs, items, etc).  At 255, he hit a wall.  No matter what he did after<br/>
that, his Dex rose no higher.  Anyone else ever notice that?  I had never<br/>
seen Verant say whether or not there was a definite maximum limit on stats.<br/>
