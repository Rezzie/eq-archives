Ahem..<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone else has set a standard for corpse relocations.<br/>
I usually charge 5 GP minimum for up to level 5, plus 1 GP/2 levels rounded<br/>
up.  This is standard, plus I usually ask for tips or danger pay.    Does<br/>
this sound like too little?  Maybe it should be 1 PP/2 levels after level<br/>
10?<br/>
<br/>
