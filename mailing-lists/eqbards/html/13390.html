<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711903256">Didnt notice anything in the digests about this yet, so I will post.  As of<br/>
yesterday&#39;s patch, our surfing has been removed.  For me, that was one of<br/>
the neatest extra things about being a bard, with comments from friends all<br/>
the time saying that they loved it too.  I used to love watching myself run<br/>
across Norrath.  Now, when I run with selos and a drum, my legs move while<br/>
doing the drum animation, which looks horrible.  Its even worse if you are<br/>
running with a wind/brass song going--the dance is canceled out, but you<br/>
still play the instrument.  I&#39;d rather have no instrument animation than<br/>
the mess they have made of it now.  I can&#39;t believe that they removed this<br/>
after almost a year of it-- imagine, wasting time on &quot;fixing&quot; this, while<br/>
there are things like ~deadly~ pathing bugs to worry about.  I petition&#39;ed<br/>
and feedback&#39;ed the issue (even had a visit from a GM to observe), but am<br/>
doubtful that Verant even cares.<br/>
