<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] Slashing weapons for bards question... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-869407380">Ok, for those who missed the last post, I am a level 7, almost 8 bard.<br/>
Right now I am using a regular Long Sword.  Not too dramatic..:)<br/>
<br/>
I know I get dual wield at 17, and that sounds nice but I was wondering<br/>
what it maxes out at and if its better to get dual wield for 2 1h slashers<br/>
or to invest in a 2h slasher like a bibs?<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>
