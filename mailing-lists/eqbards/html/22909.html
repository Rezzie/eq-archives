<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077445909">I hate being right about something like this :(.  I really would<br/>
like to know why such a blatant bug on test would be propped to the live<br/>
servers.<br/>
<br/>
	Also, why is it that i can no longer outrun sow speeds without the<br/>
drum? Prepatch I was still faster than SOW without an instrument, now i am a<br/>
bit slower.<br/>
