<div id="ygrps-yiv-316097582">Is it possible to run through Beholder with Accelerando?  I made the trip<br/>
through last weekend crawling along high on the cliff and it was nerve<br/>
wracking.  I would much rather make a fast dash through and get it over<br/>
with!  But I saw at least a dozen evil eyes from my vantage point on the<br/>
cliff wall...can I run past fast enough to avoid trouble?<br/>
