<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-606578035">I am back from my break :)  For the last couple of months I have been <br/>
following an on-line mystery that is based off of Spielberg&#39;s new <br/>
movie, AI.  Earlier this week the people running the game made some <br/>
tickets available to advanced screenings of the movie.  If you are <br/>
interested in checking it out go here:<br/>

The site also has a link to the on-line game as well.  It has been <br/>
very well written so far :)<br/>
