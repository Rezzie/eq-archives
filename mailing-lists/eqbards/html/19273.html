<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122608331">Out of curiosity, has anyone fought Trakanon?  I hadn&#39;t heard anything and<br/>
wondered if Trakanon had even been located yet.  I always like to hear tales<br/>
of mobs it&#39;s highly unlikely I will ever see.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I fear I may have zoned into Dalnir when I went LD last nite from what<br/>
I heard from a friend.  Is it reasonably easy to get out of Dalnir once you<br/>
get in?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Given the uber-ness of the uber-mobs: Trakanon, whoever awaits in Veeshan&#39;s,<br/>
etc. Even at level 60 we will all be needing some of this uber-armor and<br/>
some uber weps. Now if we had some uber-instruments to go with the armor...<br/>
