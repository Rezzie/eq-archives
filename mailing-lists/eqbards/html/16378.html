&gt; I heard off bull alligators.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually it&#39;s off a &quot;Huge Alligator&quot; which is a very rare spawn in Innothule<br/>
Swamp.  Since Beta 2 I have seen the gator a total of maybe 10 times.  But I<br/>
don&#39;t camp/hunt him so he may be slightly more frequent.  I did spend 5<br/>
hours killing every gator in sight with my ranger once and couldn&#39;t get him<br/>
to spawn.  (Would explain why that skullcap is such a rarely owned quest<br/>
item)<br/>

PS:  I too am trying that quest.  I gave up and am waiting until I hit 35 so<br/>
I can track.  I don&#39;t like wasting my Ranger&#39;s time tracking down items for<br/>
my bard.  He doesn&#39;t even know her after all.</div>
