rationlize /loc.  Much as many migratory Earth species can find their way<br/>
north, or back to their spawning ground, or whatever, the sentient races<br/>
of Norrath all have an innate ability to recognize exactly where they are<br/>
on the planet at any time.  It comes from the ability to detect fluctuations<br/>
in the planet&#39;s magnetic field.  In fact, even the non-sentient races can<br/>
do this, because every living cell on Norrath has the necessary magnetic<br/>
rods to detect these fluctuations.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if you can believe that you can breathe underwater by playing a tune on<br/>
a minotaur&#39;s horn, you should have no problem accepting the above.  Now<br/>
you can use /loc and still call yourself a roleplayer!<br/>
