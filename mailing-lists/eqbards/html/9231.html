our AE songs affecting other groups invisibility.  <br/>

&gt; If you want to get into dirty tricks, our AE songs will blow<br/>
&gt; people&#39;s invisibility (people not grouped with you).  I found<br/>
&gt; that out accidently when I was running from a train with<br/>
&gt; Screech playing.  Dunno if I&#39;d ever use it, perhaps given a<br/>
&gt; sufficiently obnoxious kill stealer.<br/>
