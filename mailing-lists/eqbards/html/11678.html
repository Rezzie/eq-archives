&gt; I auctioned for a stone last night and someone told me that I could get one<br/>
&gt; from a merchant in Erudin (hehe I was in EK heading for Lava - not really<br/>
&gt; into a boat ride) but does the merchant have an inventory of them or was it<br/>
&gt; just an item some player sold to the merch?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One place you could try is the gypsy camp in Oasis. I&#39;ve been hunting<br/>
SG&#39;s there for a while with my druid and if there&#39;s no bards around I<br/>
usually just sell the stones to the gypsy vendor.<br/>
