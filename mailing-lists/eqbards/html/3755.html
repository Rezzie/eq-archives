<div id="ygrps-yiv-618258938">What we have here, a dodge only using a weapon.  Still, it has such glamour<br/>
to it... I would much rather riposte than jump out of the way from some<br/>
blow, dodging seems so crude.  It&#39;s just the word, maybe, that appeals to<br/>
me, the word riposte has such a bard-like sound to it.  The dashing bard<br/>
with a wry smile ripostes!  Ah--but holding me lute I be fairly worthless<br/>
doing that I better just dodge like a young monk in Guk.<br/>
