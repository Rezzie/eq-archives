&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my experience if you target a player with no corpse in the zone, you<br/>
&gt; get the same message saying that you sense a corpse in this direction,<br/>
&gt; but it does not actually turn you in any direction. Maybe you were<br/>
&gt; already pointing in that direction, and just though it was pulling you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>

started the song.  I definately got turned around when I got the &quot;You sense<br/>
a corpse&quot; message.  <br/>
