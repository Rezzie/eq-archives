<div id="ygrps-yiv-990136674">I always thought that the haste bonus should go up with a horn too, 30%<br/>
would make sense with the horn equipped...  Does anyone use beserker without<br/>
a horn?  It doesnt make much sense to me (and I am 48 so no verse of victory<br/>
yet).  I dont really care since I figure when I get 50, I would never play<br/>
it again...<br/>
