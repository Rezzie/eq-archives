It was my little way of keeping a flame on topic.  I so rarely feel<br/>
justified in flaming anyone that I do like to let go once in a great while.<br/>
 I&#39;ve had so little practise that I&#39;m not all that good at it.<br/>

Anapests, eh?  Is that the technical term for the right number of syllables<br/>
with the accents in the right places?  Any of us who write ballads indeed<br/>
need to be aware of the rhythm of the words, eh?  You see a lot of attempts<br/>
at poetry that rhyme by don&#39;t quite get the rhythm.<br/>
