<div id="ygrps-yiv-152458351">This is the same question I wanted to ask the list today.  I was in <br/>
frenzied last night and I got a ton of very early wear-off messages on <br/>
this song.  I was wondering whether I had found a sour spot in my <br/>
twisting cycle (e.g., I was twisting just fast enough to get the song <br/>
starts/song stops problem) or if this was a problem with Chains itself.  <br/>
At my level, the stuff we were fighting is mostly normal blue.  The song <br/>
ought to work pretty well.<br/>

&gt; Hey,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now that we are getting messages when our song effects wear off, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; noticed that our snare song amost never lasts the full duration. Many times<br/>
&gt; it wears off as soon as I finish singing it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was wondering if any of you were having the same problem and whether or<br/>
&gt; not this is by design or a bug that we should bring to the attention of the<br/>
&gt; powers that be.<br/>
