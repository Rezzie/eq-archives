&gt; No argument here.  Bards are great when the primary class isn&#39;t present.  We<br/>

Verant has made things so difficult at high levels that you have to have<br/>
multiple groups for almost everything, and it&#39;s not very likely that you<br/>
will be missing the primary class at all. This then makes the bard role<br/>
extremely limited, taking a lot of the fun out of playing the character.<br/>
