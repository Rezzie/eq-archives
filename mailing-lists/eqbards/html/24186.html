&gt;it&#39;s a nice song that works well and i find a lot of use out of it.  now if<br/>

difference of our views on the class.  for example while most of us consider<br/>
charm a staple song, you probably don&#39;t even have it memmed most of the<br/>
time, right?  actually it would be kind of interesting to see what your &#39;&#39;normal&#39;&#39;<br/>
song list does contain, if you don&#39;t mind giving out that info, heh.<br/>
