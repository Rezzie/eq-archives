<div id="ygrps-yiv-851962070">I don&#39;t mean this as a dig to anyone in particular but this is a great list<br/>
and I really think we should all work hard on refraining from calling one<br/>
another&#39;s ideas stupid or silly.  We have over 300 members in our list and<br/>
about 10-20 who post regularly - that means we have a lot of lurkers and we<br/>
don&#39;t want people to be afraid to speak up for fear of being berated or<br/>
belittled for their opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m all for peace, harmony, and getting along and continuing to have<br/>
intelligent and mature debates over issues.<br/>
<br/>
Just something to think about.<br/>
