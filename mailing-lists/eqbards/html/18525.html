&gt; If you ask someone in a different guild if they want to join <br/>
&gt; yours, IMHO,<br/>
&gt; you ARE stealing players from that other guild. If they are <br/>
&gt; not currently<br/>
&gt; IN a guild and/or ask you if they can join your guild, then you aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; stealing, it was their choice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s their choice anyway.  But I think the best thing to do would have the<br/>
leader of the guild looking to recruit contact the leader of the players<br/>
current guild and let them know what they&#39;re doing and why.  <br/>
