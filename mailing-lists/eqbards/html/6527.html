<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480577341">Yes that was a bad choice of terms.  By my own definition I was a newbie<br/>
until last night:-)  Finally made 23d level after dying at least ten times<br/>
at 22d level.   I guess the proper phrase to use would be that if Chain<br/>
breaks root and Selos no longer does, the new patch has a major negative<br/>
impact on anyone less than 23d level.  <br/>
