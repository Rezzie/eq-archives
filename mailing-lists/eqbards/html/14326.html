<div id="ygrps-yiv-861878319"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Ugh. this post I find very undesirable reading. I think opinions about<br/>
&gt; Verant&#39;s quality should be left off this list. The start of this thread<br/>
&gt; was basically a request to keep things from being a &quot;flame Verant&quot; event<br/>
&gt; if I understood correctly. This entire post was nothing but a long rant,<br/>
&gt; and just showed to drive the orginial poster&#39;s point home. If your<br/>
&gt; intent is to drive people away from reading eqbards that want to learn<br/>
&gt; more about the bard class, you are succeeding.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Give me a fucking break, don&#39;t ever post shit like that again.<br/>
  If you have a problem with me address it to me.  I&#39;m growing<br/>
  very tired of you Verant asskissers.  That clear enough?<br/>
<br/>
  Use your power, and press the delete key, because you are the naive<br/>
  one here buddy.  I for one don&#39;t give a shit about what you think<br/>
  after that kind of bashing. ;)<br/>
<br/>
  btw, have a nice day.<br/>
