I believe you are on an island whose /loc is approximately -1696 +2400.  You<br/>
should put jig on and swim to the Sister Island whose coordinates are +211<br/>
, -9190.  You can do this, I have done it many times.  The boat docks here<br/>
right after it zones from Freeport.  Just so you know you are on right<br/>
island there are many Sister of Errollsi (sp.) guarding and some dwarfs.<br/>
Nothing on this island will attack you.  Just keep checking the /who and<br/>
when you see people in zone ask one of them or shout where is the boat.<br/>
Don&#39;t get frustrated swimming, you will get there, and it&#39;s a great way to<br/>
raise your swimming skill.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
