<div id="ygrps-yiv-161464133"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Bard & Wizard are fighting in lower Guk. Bard is bound in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Freeport while Wizard is bound in Innothule right outside<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Guk zone line. Bard & Wizard die. Bard runs through 5<br/>
&gt; &gt; zones, and does so naked with no weapon. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No, bard sits and memorizes songs, finishes, clicks on &quot;Yes&quot;<br/>
&gt; to the resurrection prompt from the group&#39;s cleric.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; See what I mean about you picking worst-case scenarios?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If &quot;more likely to happen&quot; scenarios are your version of<br/>
&quot;worst-case&quot; then so be it. You&#39;re assuming that everyone<br/>
is of the high enough level to group with a level 29+<br/>
cleric. (Assuming such a level cleric is even available)<br/>
<br/>
Again, your point is moot to people that aren&#39;t of higher<br/>
levels.</div>
