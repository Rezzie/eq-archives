You can bypass voting if you want by just clicking on &quot;View the Results&quot;. I <br/>
don&#39;t mean to start a grip session. As a bard I consider us quite powerful, <br/>
but then again, I&#39;m level 38 and pretty much loving life as I&#39;m able to do <br/>
all the things a bard can, without just getting the &quot;sing manasong only&quot; <br/>
too often.<br/>
