&gt; I made level 40 yesterday and was wondering if anyone knew what would be a<br/>
&gt; good place to go, being a bard I don&#39;t have the luxury of being able to<br/>
&gt; solo dwarfs all day and make it out of hell.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sol B.  You want the King Room, the Pool Room, the Noble Room (in that order of preference).  Go early and<br/>
ask to get on the stupid lists.  If you get there before noon on weekends and six on weekdays (EST) you<br/>
have a good chance of getting into something right away.  If you really want to get in the King Room (and<br/>
you do), put yourself on the list about 6am and go back to sleep.<br/>
