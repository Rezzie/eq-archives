<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282340295">most of the groups i am in have 3 or 4 melee classes.  the class that holds<br/>
up groups more than any other (at this level) is lack of a cleric.<br/>
basically it&#39;s &quot;find a cleric, start a group.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
i was in a group the other day, most fun i have had in the longest time.<br/>
Rogue, Warrior, Warrior, Paladin, Ranger, Bard.  one of the warrior was also<br/>
playing a cleric outside the group, but team tank was tearing up sebilis.<br/>
we stayed at the zone, but we were pulling all of the zone, the portal, and<br/>
even the front of the guardian camp =)  the cleric hardly had to heal, mana<br/>
song with lute was enough for most of the time hehe.  was a blast.<br/>
