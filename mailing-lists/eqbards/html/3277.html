&gt;That&#39;s one of the great things about EQ!  You can MAKE fiends.  Take one<br/>
&gt;lost soul with a mis-located corpse.  Put into group with a bard (that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;you), play Lyssa&#39;s & combine!  You have fashioned something entirely new!  A<br/>
&gt;new fiend.  And if you take up tailoring (I am a broken record - but you<br/>
&gt;keep axeing and I keep telling) you can make patchwork armor for players.<br/>
&gt;That is actually a bit more tricky.<br/>
