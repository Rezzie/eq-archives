<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804806313"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Powerleveling anyone can be easily done with a higher (lvl 24 spells I<br/>
&gt; think) druid. They just buff you up some, especially getting their<br/>
&gt; damage shield, then heal you while you fight reds.  My friend shot up<br/>
&gt; his guildmate from 8-12 in a few hours...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  My point is with a bard you dont just click one button to do something.<br/>
  Powerleveling a bard is useless, if they dont know what they are doing.<br/>
  Most bards I see don&#39;t know what they are doing anyway.  (ie: bellow)<br/>
  <br/>
  With clerics, it&#39;s easy - they heal.  With wizards, it&#39;s easy - the<br/>
  blast.  Powerleveling a class who has to adapt and think is much more<br/>
  difficult, which was the thing I was getting at.<br/>
