<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606101640">Had one of those weird AE Taunt things last night.  Anyone else getting these<br/>
since the Reduced Bard Hate patch?<br/>
<br/>
Ran out of lavastorm with 50 health.  Couldn&#39;t even see a pixel on my health<br/>
bar.  Entered Nek and fired up the Hymn.<br/>
<br/>
Two players are killing a DE guard 30 feet from me, on the path.  Guard spins<br/>
around, runs down the path, across the zone entrance alcove,<br/>
and cuts my head off.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not grouped.  I&#39;m not anywhere near the guard.  I&#39;ve been in the zone<br/>
exactly 15 seconds, and I manage to taunt a half dead guard away<br/>
from the 2 guys who are killing it.<br/>
<br/>
Suck.  If this is reduced, maybe I should be grateful for the 15 seconds I had<br/>
before I was killed.<br/>
