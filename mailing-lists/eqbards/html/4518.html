looked around from the surface with my eyes just in the water enough to be<br/>
able to see clearly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re meaning by a particular dock and needing to kill a<br/>
particular sea roaming creature. I&#39;m able to easily kill it, but not with<br/>
enough speed as to prevent it from going off and supposedly losing the chest<br/>
before coming back to fight more. (Least that&#39;s what I&#39;ve read happens)</div>
