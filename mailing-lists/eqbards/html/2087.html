&gt; &gt;Sigh. After the last late night patch, I discovered the recently<br/>
&gt; &gt;discussed stacking of magic resist songs no longer works. What&#39;s up with<br/>

&gt; ???  I was stacking Guardian and Elemental Rhythms just this morning. <br/>
&gt;  Combined with what I was wearing, this gave me 80-plus magic resistance <br/>
&gt; without drum, and a whopping 120 with drum.  (The bastard Solusek Noble <br/>
