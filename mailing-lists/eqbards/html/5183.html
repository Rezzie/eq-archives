<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020465889">You can also mesh one of your song (hit the hotkey for one of your song <br/>
about 15 times really really really fast) and that will unlock your song.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I&#39;ve noticed that if I take a lag spike when singing,<br/>
&gt;it will lock the song in, and then I can&#39;t sing any<br/>
&gt;song until I get bashed, zone, or log off and back on. </span></blockquote></div>
