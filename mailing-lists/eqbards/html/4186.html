&gt;     I was fighting spiders in E. Karana a while back and got &#39;Halfling<br/>
&gt;     parts&quot; as loot. (eeuuww) Twice.  Quite a shock.  I think it was salted<br/>
&gt;     by someone with a wicked sense of humor but I&#39;m not 100 percent sure.<br/>
&gt;     It is conceivable that a giant spider would have Halfling parts<br/>
&gt;     (Samwise, where is Frodo anyway...) but I haven&#39;t seen this extreme<br/>
&gt;     level of humor before from variant.  Anyone else have a similar<br/>
&gt;     experience?<br/>

a grisly sense of humor</div>
