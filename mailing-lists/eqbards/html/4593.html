&gt; If you&#39;re careful, they&#39;re really not that bad. (Mainly due to Selo&#39;s &<br/>
&gt; Hymn) They have less downtime, and faster escapes. To me that makes them<br/>
&gt; great for solo&#39;ing.<br/>

mid 20s - you can only take on low blues unless you kite.  At<br/>
27 you get charm and at 28 you get mesmerize.  These will let<br/>
you take on things you normally couldn&#39;t or would otherwise<br/>
have to kite (instead of Selo/Hymn, you do Pixie/Hymn).<br/>
High blues become easy, and under the right circumstances you<br/>
can take out whites and yellows.  Last night I pretty much<br/>
took out a greater darkbone, barbed bone, and mortuary fungus<br/>
solo in Unrest.  I just charmed the fungus over and over.  It<br/>
killed the other two, I melee&#39;ed it for about 5 seconds and it<br/>
turned to run, so I chained it.  My cleric friend only had to<br/>
hit me with one heal the entire fight.<br/>
