<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684366252">one half of lower guk is populated by undead frogs (ghoul frogs), and the<br/>
other half is populated with live frogs (like found in upper guk) as well as<br/>
minotaurs.<br/>

&gt; less Lower Guk.<br/>
&gt; Does that mean that part of Lower Guk is empty?  Or not <br/>
&gt; implemented yet?<br/>
