<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786892467"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; One thing that I would like added for bards, but I don&#39;t know <br/>
&gt; if other&#39;s <br/>
&gt; would want it, is a button we could toggle between &#39;Group&#39; <br/>
&gt; and &#39;All&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would have to agree with you. It always seemed silly to me that only<br/>
people in my group were able to hear my songs.<br/>
<br/>
But.. on the other hand, if the songs affect everyone that can hear them,<br/>
then they would logically affect the mobs you&#39;re fighting as well. And think<br/>
of all the complaining that would arrise from Bards being able to<br/>
mana-lessly heal and buff other players just by standing next to them.</div>
