&gt; Personally, I&#39;d consider it an affront if all of a sudden our various<br/>
&gt; excellent *real* instruments; Selo&#39;s Drums, Kelin&#39;s Lute et al, were<br/>
&gt; suddenly relegated by a sword!  I tend to be a bit of a battle Bard,<br/>
&gt; whipping out my claws and Kilij when the opportunity arises, but I&#39;d much<br/>
&gt; rather kill with my songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think they got too engrossed in making uber weapons for each class to<br/>
&gt; consider that at level 50-60 (the range for completion of the quest) our<br/>
&gt; tanking abilities are greatly overshadowed by what we can accomplish with<br/>
&gt; instruments and songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Still, I suspect Verant have more expansions beyond Velious under their<br/>
&gt; sleeves.  They might actually get an ounce of sense and give us something<br/>
&gt; useful. ; </span></blockquote></div>
