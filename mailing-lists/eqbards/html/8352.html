<div id="ygrps-yiv-444719926">So, any other guesses as to why the Burned Out Lightstones are NO DROP?  Or<br/>
can we go on to a new topic?<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re no drop to foil Lightstone hunters.  Many people hunt wisps at night,<br/>
and once judged which wisps to kill by whether they had a glow or not.  Now,<br/>
the wisps that used to have no lightstone at all have burned out lightstones,<br/>
so they all glow at night.  They are NO DROP so that unscrupulous players<br/>
can&#39;t sell them to newbies (since they dissappear when you log, and are<br/>
worthless to vendors).<br/>
