&gt;At some point I had seen data from a timing test that someone had done<br/>
&gt;on this subject.  I remember it saying that it didn&#39;t matter whether the<br/>
&gt;mana song was sung repeatedly, or weaved with 2 others songs -- the mana<br/>
&gt;recover was the same.<br/>

mana song enhances the regeneration speed, exactly like our Hymn does,<br/>
thus, it should be quite weavable.  If anyone has any different<br/>
information, please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, I noticed something interesting last night.  I died in<br/>
Unrest, and was revived (LOVE that spell - saved me a ten minute walk<br/>
back), and was nailed with the typical regeneration effects.  This effect<br/>
is supposed to prevent you from immediately being buffed and ready to<br/>
charge - however, Bardic songs seem to be immune to this particular effect.<br/>
 I was able to sing all of my songs immediately afterwards, and suffered<br/>
nothing except a massive loss of mana. Not that I use Mana.... ;)<br/>
