<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340466187">Okay experts - I forget the theories, formulas etc - just want some simple advice. Just got the Staff of Writhing for 400p - So I now have - Staff of Writhing; Brazen Brass Kilij; Dragoon Dirk; and a Gnoll Hide Lariat.<br/>
<br/>
    Just wondering what people think the best setup is for me - Primary Hand; Off Hand (and range assuming ppl think I shouldn&#39;t use the Dirk in either hand).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
