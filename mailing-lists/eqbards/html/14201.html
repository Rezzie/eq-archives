<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170788049"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; As a Troll Shaman who worships Cazic, exactly what do I have to kill to get<br/>
&gt; enough faction to walk into Freeport and not be KOS?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  First go kill those stupid EK Mucktails.  Any Mucktail you see kill it.<br/>
  This will get you Highpass/Qeynos faction.  Once you have enough <br/>
  Highpass faction, go to Highkeep and buy goblin ears off people for<br/>
  a few plats, this will up your standing with the Freeport Militia <br/>
  significantly.  If you&#39;ve every killed a Freeport guard or helped<br/>
  your Pally friend out with Lucan, you can probably forget about <br/>
  ever going across the Commons / Freeport without training guards.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m sure there are other Freeport raising factions, but this<br/>
  accomplishes all three human cities at once.<br/>
