Ok, so curiosity got the better of you I see 8)<br/>
Here is the story- there is a guard that spawns<br/>
in the bank named Krazen Loosh. The people are<br/>
all camping there waiting for him to spawn so<br/>
they can kill him. Apparently, the other guards<br/>
do not assist him. There is a minor faction hit<br/>
associated with killing Krazen but I have seen<br/>
people camp for a week without becoming KOS. <br/>
He is VERY easy to take down and drops lots of<br/>
platinum so now that pottery is nerfed, Krazen is the<br/>
newest get rich quick scheme. (Although people have<br/>
been killing him for quite a long, its the<br/>
former potters joining the sadists that has created<br/>
the mess) I wish Verant would do something about it<br/>
because it has gotten out of hand. Maybe we should<br/>
all camp the bank and bring the zone down to bring<br/>
the point home to Verant 8)<br/>
