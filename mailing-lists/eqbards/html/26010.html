<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149462328">After hitting 5 different stores this morning I finally got the PoP expansion ... was late coming bak to work from lunch but well worth the time it took:<br/>
Plane of Knowledge:  Bard Trainer is a Virtuoso, merchants are Minstrels.  Bard Vendors are in the basement of the library and Minstrel Cirsaelle sells the new songs:<br/>
Chant of Disease is lvl 42 and costs 20pp<br/>
Chant of Poison is lvl 50 and costs 23pp<br/>
Scream of Pain is 61 and costs 5pp.<br/>
Didn&#39;t see the other songs but I was already late getting back to work.  Anybody know where the other songs are or if they are combat drops?<br/>
Tyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>
Dol Amroth<br/>
