&gt; nice, ghoul lord at zone.  never seen that before.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Totally amazing. Just trying to think how you could possible pull that<br/>
off. The only way I could think to manage it would be to be bound on the<br/>
lower side by the zone line and gate out of a fight with him. At that<br/>
point the teleport code might kick in and he&#39;d teleport to you. Hmm.<br/>
<br/>
The only other way I could see this would be someone with a ton of hp<br/>
and sow, and even then I couldn&#39;t see them making it all the way to the<br/>
zone unless the rest of the dungeon was picked clean.<br/>
