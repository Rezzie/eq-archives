<div id="ygrps-yiv-127451865">I just wish there were more of the rare npc&#39;s with interesting loot like you<br/>
find in the Karana&#39;s and in Lesser Faydark.  Unfortunately I have never seen<br/>
any of them in the Karana&#39;s despite looking.  I have seen several of the<br/>
ones in Lesser fay however.<br/>
I think more encounters like these will give those of us who find camping<br/>
more boring than calculus a better entertainment value in the game.<br/>

that camping is a problem, but I believe some<br/>
people expect inappropriate loot on some mobs.<br/>
(Not to say that some mobs have loot that makes<br/>
absolutely no sense, but still..)<br/>
