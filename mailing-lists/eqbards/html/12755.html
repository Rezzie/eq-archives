<div id="ygrps-yiv-952860834">If you or anyone wants to post the idea on Sony&#39;s EQ message board go ahead.<br/>
I&#39;m technically not even supposed to be using this email address (military)<br/>
to post on this list.  Sure as hell don&#39;t want the address posted up on a<br/>
public message board.  Uncle Sam may get the idea that I&#39;m goofing off at<br/>
work:-)<br/>

&gt; &gt; server players who earned there levels the regular way.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   That is a sweet idea, Gal.  I would definitely suggest that and<br/>
&gt;   back you up on it.<br/>
