&gt; PErhaps the kobolds believe the only way you can avoid reliving the<br/>
&gt; past is by remembering it. So these pictures are their way of reliving<br/>
&gt; past treacheries, and thus keeping them from happening again...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We learn about our own past failures after all.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Well, unless we work at Verant anyway. :)<br/>

Yeah a dead king has a way of reminding one that you f&#39;d up before and what<br/>
the penalty is in a way no amount of whining necros ever could.<br/>
