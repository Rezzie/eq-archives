by top members of the guild (who evidently knew some of the Verant folks RL.<br/>
They<br/>
are game company, in the same (time and time again) -- and Kollos just about<br/>
quit because it took WEEKS to get settled, Solist finally reimbursed by<br/>
recreating. (I think it had gone beyond easy backup at that time) And that<br/>
was due to a game bug. so yeah. Sol Ro seems to be slow sometimes.</div>
