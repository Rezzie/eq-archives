&gt;prolly on all servers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s not broken on Innoruuk, and I would doubt she is broken<br/>
on any &#39;intelligent&#39; server where stoopid noob f&#39;ing idiots<br/>
don&#39;t attack her.  I mean jeez... Named NPCs don&#39;t mean new<br/>
camping grounds.  I&#39;m glad I watched some craphead level 45<br/>
person die hard when he attempted to kill her.  Then I reamed<br/>
him.  No one has attacked her since, that I know of.  She&#39;s<br/>
always been available.<br/>
<br/>
I have all the pieces of lambent now, save the helm which sucks.<br/>
Saturday early morning I clocked in with all the goodies.<br/>
However, I will probably acquire it to test something out --<br/>
I&#39;m just not in a hurry to do so.<br/>
