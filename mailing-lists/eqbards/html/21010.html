<div id="ygrps-yiv-406499854">I&#39;ve been out of the loop for past few weeks and haven&#39;t kept up to speed on<br/>
any recent game changes that affect bards (newborn babies will do that to<br/>
you).  Was wondering if the Fabian quest been &quot;fixed&quot; yet?  I heard that now<br/>
you get some special coin.  Has anyone figured out what to do with the coin<br/>
yet?  Or is the final verdict that this is just another lame quest with<br/>
little to no reward?<br/>
<br/>
Any other game changes that affect bards since early July?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
