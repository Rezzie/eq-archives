My choice-<br/>
Song of Highsun<br/>
Ever since I got this song last week I have been driving my guild nuts.<br/>
Whenever we are mobilizing in some safe zone (like WC for a trip up to PoH)<br/>
I will grab a wandering mob quietly pull it to the gathering then use this<br/>
song.  What everyone there sees is &#39;A Giant spider Gates.&#39; Only a few of<br/>
them have figured out what is up :)</div>
