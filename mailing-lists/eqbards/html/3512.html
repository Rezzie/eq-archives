<div id="ygrps-yiv-519767540">The problem with doing it this way, is that roleplayers come up on a who list <br/>
as ananymous.  So they won&#39;t come up when you do a search by level.  You miss <br/>
alot of good people that way (such as me :))<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;Your best bet is to do /who 8 12 (assuming you are level 10) to list the<br/>
&gt;players within a couple levels of you - do /tells to them directly.  Also -<br/>
&gt;to people nearby a /say is pretty effective.<br/>
