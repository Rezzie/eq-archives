i see weird animations as well with it, but after the first pulse i go to no<br/>
animation at all other than normal running.  with SSoT i do not get the<br/>
waddle i get with normal Selo&#39;s.  i think the weird SSoT animations come<br/>
after i zone, or on the first pulse only.<br/>

&gt; I am wondering if anyone that has the Selo&#39;s Song of Travel <br/>
&gt; has noticed the <br/>
&gt; animation acting funny. To me, it looks as if the animatioon <br/>
&gt; for the silly <br/>
&gt; waddle and the arm waving are trying to go off at the same <br/>
&gt; time, resulting <br/>
&gt; in my character leaning hard to one side sometimes or <br/>
&gt; waddling erratically. <br/>
&gt; Is it just me?<br/>
