<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031150504">I think that&#39;s the major complaint - we get all these neato &#39;other&#39; class<br/>
skills - but our caps are so low - it makes you wonder why they bothered? I<br/>
don&#39;t necessarily want to track as good as a ranger, or forage - but I<br/>
WOULD like to be able to have the thing be useful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  The other thought i have to add here is that like tracking<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;for druids...its a special skill.  we get it at a level and it never<br/>
&gt;advances..it caps at 20 and when we get it that is the skill we get it<br/>
&gt;at.  Is it possible that bards get forage and its at skill lvl 40 when<br/>
&gt;we get it.  Just a thought...  oh yeah and skill cap for druids is 200<br/>
&gt;i believe </span></blockquote></div>
