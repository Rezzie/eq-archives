<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002698315">I just wanted to verify what I think I know:<br/>
<br/>
Chains will break all other classes root/snare type spells, but in a recent<br/>
change will stack with other classes slowdown debuffs except the necro<br/>
darkness line.<br/>
<br/>
Binding will not break mez, but it will break other classes slowdown<br/>
debuffs.<br/>
<br/>
Attack speed buffs will not stack with any other classes speed buffs, but<br/>
will stack with equipment speed buffs.<br/>
<br/>
Is this all correct?  Are there any other stacking issues that I haven&#39;t<br/>
thought of?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
