<div id="ygrps-yiv-1484858404"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; in my ever-annoying habit of correcting people, EBW is not a better ratio<br/>
&gt; than yak, it is the exact same ratio.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At level 50 you can expect this:<br/>
<br/>
(7 * (50/10) + 1) / (21/10) = 17.14 dmg/sec max.   EBW<br/>
(8 * (50/10) + 1) / (24/10) = 17.08 dmg/sec max.   YAK<br/>
<br/>
So yes, the EBW has a better ratio, however small.<br/>
They are not exactly the same, as you have stated. =)<br/>
