<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742363421">Right, the Grub and Grog is almost hidden near Hallard&#39;s resales.  Has two<br/>
female proprietors and some Militia customers IIRC.  One of the wandering<br/>
npc&#39;s used to spawn in there from what I remember.<br/>

You guys are thinking of the bar by the Docks - not the grub n grog.  The <br/>
Grub&#39;n&#39;Grog is nearer to the south gate.<br/>
