<div id="ygrps-yiv-960892272">Ok, made a newbie human bard, 110 charisma, followed whatever<br/>
god was the god of thieves and gypsies.  Ran down to Oasis,<br/>
checked the prices on the gypsies.  52.5pp for a combine<br/>
longsword.  All the prices matched the prices I got with my<br/>
wood elf bard, and fit my 5% theory.  *None* of the combine<br/>
prices were lower than what I&#39;d listed as minimums, contrary<br/>
to what other(s) have reported.<br/>
