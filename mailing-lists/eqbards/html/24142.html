<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087754379">useful is too subjective a term, hence all the arguing.  all our songs are<br/>
not useful, but neither are all spells.  it only hurts us more if we don&#39;t<br/>
find a song useful cause we get generally 1 per level.  and gimme a break<br/>
you know you don&#39;t think you&#39;re a crappy bard.<br/>

&gt; belief that all our songs are useful in one form or another. </span></blockquote></div>
