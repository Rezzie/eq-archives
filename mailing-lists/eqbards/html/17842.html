&gt; I thought of a compromise that we used a couple of times in the past when<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t agree on who should get into the lotto for a couple of items.  We<br/>
&gt; setup 3 groups, primary, secondary, and tertiary.  The primaries got to<br/>
&gt; random 21-120, the secondaries 1-100, the tertiaries 1-80.  That weighted<br/>
&gt; the distribution but at least everyone felt like they were involved.  A<br/>
&gt; tertiary won the first lotto strangely enough with a 37 roll.<br/>
<br/>
This is a really really really cool idea.<br/>
