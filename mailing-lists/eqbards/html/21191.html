<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-122741513"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Last night however, we were doing a practice Kaesora raid with mostly guild<br/>
members, and EVERY time I switched from full screen to windowed, my chat<br/>
history text would dissapear.  Someone in my group mentioned that he only<br/>
noticed that problem when grouped with a bard.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I noticed this too, this morning.  Something must have happened overnight,<br/>
because everything was fine when I was playing last night.<br/>
<br/>
I found that switching back and forth a couple of times brought the history<br/>
back.</div>
