<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761797795">Initially put a really fast weapon in your off hand to get your dual<br/>
skill caught up.  The gnoll hide lariat comes to mind (speed 20) or<br/>
tentacle whip (speed 26).<br/>
<br/>
As for interupting casters the anemic damage we do rarely seems to<br/>
interupt NPC casters as I approach 20.  As for PC casters I guess you<br/>
can still do it.<br/>

Is Tallon the one where they are going to make it no0item looting?  We<br/>
group may switch to that server and make our halfling army.  (Warrior,<br/>
rogue x2, druid x2, cleric)<br/>
