<div id="ygrps-yiv-765197168">I haven&#39;t played it but supposedly Asheron&#39;s Call has this kind of feature.<br/>
From what I have heard, if you are faster than a mob and are running away<br/>
from it, after a certain amount of time it will lose interest in you.  I<br/>
would assume EQ programmers could figure out a way to implement a similar<br/>
feature in EQ if they wanted to.  Question is do they want to?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The real solution is a time-based hatred demotion system,<br/>
&gt; where a mob&#39;s hatred for you (as well as your kill-credit<br/>
&gt; potential) declines over time the mob is not being attacked.<br/>
&gt; Yes this would be difficult; but if you&#39;re going to fix<br/>
&gt; something, fix it right.  Unless the problem is very<br/>
&gt; detrimental to the game (which feign death wasn&#39;t), don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; waste time going from one broken state to another broken<br/>
&gt; state.<br/>
