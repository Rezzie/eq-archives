&gt; In fact, you should be able to train up to six languages at once (one for <br/>
&gt; each grouped member), although odd numbers would be hard to keep track of <br/>
&gt;  (since you would need to cycle the languages, rather than just switch <br/>
&gt; back and forth).  Still, it shouldn&#39;t take that much longer to do <br/>
&gt; multiple languages.  Anyone on Innoruuk want to try it?<br/>

Spam language #1 until you get two skill increases.  Switch to<br/>
language #2 until you get two skill increases.  Repeat for<br/>
half the languages (with your partner doing the other half),<br/>
then zone.  Repeat on the other side.<br/>
