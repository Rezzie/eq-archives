<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310560810">Ok, have we made any progress on this quest yet?<br/>
<br/>
I have been asking in guildchat if anyone has foraged a Burynai Bundt Cake<br/>
in Field of Bone.  The answer I got was &quot;yes, what&#39;s it for?&quot;, to which I<br/>
replied a Bardic equipment quest.  Well as it turns out it was not the<br/>
guildmate that had foraged it, it was a Guide on our server that had.  [This<br/>
Guide is a really colorful and likeable gnome that frequently pops into<br/>
Hate, Sky, etc. and runs around entertaining us.]  The Guide apparently<br/>
asked our guildmates who had been nearby if they knew what the heck a<br/>
Burynai Bundt Cake was for.  I haven&#39;t seen the Guide online recently, but<br/>
if/when I do I&#39;ll try and squeeze some info out of him about his forage<br/>
skill and where he might have foraged such a thing.  Unfortunately, if he&#39;s<br/>
smart he won&#39;t tell me.  ;-/<br/>
