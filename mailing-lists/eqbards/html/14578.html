<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684846692">Well I&#39;m not going to complain if they fix the Rogue class, we&#39;re all better<br/>
off.  Anyhow, the throwing bit impacts us - more throwable objects trickles<br/>
down.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah throwing is kind of a joke, but throwing axes have a range of 120 and<br/>
if you&#39;re pulling that easily outdistances our targetable songs - the they<br/>
were stackable it&#39;d be even better.  Can you tell I&#39;m trying to justify all<br/>
those hours of begging magicians for daggers and then looking like a drunken<br/>
darts player? =)<br/>
