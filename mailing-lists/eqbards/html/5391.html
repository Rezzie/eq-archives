player (usually a party member) on its own, and won&#39;t listen<br/>
to your /pet attack commands until you tell it to back off.<br/>
<br/>
/pet follow me for pulling casters, so they walk right up to<br/>
your melee party members instead of standing off in the<br/>
distance peppering you with spells.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t keep /pet guard me hotkeyed since it seems to be the<br/>
default state of your pet.  (So does /pet follow me, but they<br/>
seem to need to be reminded to follow me more often than to<br/>
guard me.)<br/>
<br/>
I also keep /pet sit down hotkeyed so I can see mobs doing<br/>
things they otherwise normally wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
