&gt; Bards used to be useful in large raids for their ability to provide <br/>
resists,<br/>
&gt; but given the influx of uber gear it is not difficult to obtain <br/>
unbuffed<br/>
&gt; resists in the 150s in multiple areas. Add to that the soft cap on <br/>
resists<br/>
&gt; and the fact that even with maxed resists many, many spells land <br/>
anyway and<br/>
&gt; bards have little to no use in a raid. </span></blockquote></div>
