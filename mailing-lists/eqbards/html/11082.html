&gt; Heh heh, I have a question do caster&#39;s get interrupted every time they are<br/>
&gt; bashed for 1 pt even when they are not stunned?  I know I lose my song<br/>
&gt; whenever bashed for damage.  I nearly died fighting three green no xp<br/>
<br/>
&gt;At higher levels, about once a RL week, I&#39;ll be bashed, take<br/>
&gt;damage, and my song will not end.  It&#39;s rare enough that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;probably a bug.  :-)<br/>

mob for 2 damage and Lullaby did not drop.  A bug within a bug?<br/>
