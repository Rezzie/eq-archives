<div id="ygrps-yiv-149319189">I tried Grieg&#39;s once and not to thrilled with it.  I&#39;d say Umbrial is<br/>
probably my favorite Luclin zone.  Didn&#39;t realize you still played Bril -<br/>
gonna have to look for you online one of these days!<br/>
<br/>
I dinged 59 within the last week - the way I play - it looks like it will<br/>
still be a long time before I get to 60!<br/>
<br/>
Anyways - I hope to see you all on Xegony one of these days!<br/>
