&lt;&lt; Bards/Rogues are similar classes so I don&#39;t see why they can&#39;t let us wield<br/>
 the same weapons. However I can understand Rogues getting more choice of<br/>
 weapons as they do not have the choice of any other weapon skills. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually rogues can use 1h blunt and 1h slash along with piercing.<br/>
