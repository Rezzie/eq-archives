<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814227201">Hello All , <br/>
	I remember seeing a discussion going on about, where to purchase the <br/>
Water Breathing song , and its effect is obvious, but my question is , is it <br/>
useful ? Are there any dungeons that are completely under water? things like <br/>
that really interest me , someplace that almost no one goes to. If anyone <br/>
knows it would be greatly appreciated . <br/>
P.S. - if you don&#39;t want to spoil it for others , e-mail is a-ok. <br/>
