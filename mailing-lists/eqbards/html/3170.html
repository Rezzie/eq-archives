Throwing weapons, especially shurikens, have a greater range<br/>
than Bellow.  I used Bellow to fetch most of the time (Chain<br/>
now), but I still keep some shurikens equipped just in case.<br/>
They are fast, so you can often use them to pull a monster to<br/>
you before a competing caster can nuke it.  Don&#39;t expect the<br/>
damage to ever amount to anything though.<br/>
