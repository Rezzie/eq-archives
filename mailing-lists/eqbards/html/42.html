<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999815595">As I recently achieved a level that allows me to begin sharpening my<br/>
skills on wind instruments, I will be looking to acquire a proper<br/>
instrument shortly. I have heard that Minotaur Horns may be used for<br/>
this purpose, and as an avid hunter of these great snorting beasts I<br/>
think using one would be quite appropriate. I would just like to verify<br/>
that this is indeed the case - that a Minotaur Horn IS a wind instrument<br/>
- and humbly ask of those senior to myself.... is there a performance<br/>
difference between such a horn and an instrument that one would buy in a Guild?<br/>
<br/>
Many Thanks!<br/>
