<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486222948">that&#39;s not too bad if true.  in my groups those pets are just pesky and<br/>
usually ignored til the owner is dead anyway, so we can just charm him at<br/>
the end of the fight and avoid the pain of having to kill it.<br/>

&gt; eq.castersrealm.com says you can charm pets after the owner<br/>
&gt; has been killed.  Still not perfect, but better than not being<br/>
&gt; able to charm at all.  Apparently this is aimed at PvP, where<br/>
&gt; magicians were being annoyed by bards and enchanters charming<br/>
&gt; (and instakilling with invisibility) their pets.<br/>
