<div id="ygrps-yiv-963795564">Hail, fellow bards. I am Boru, Half-Elf Bard of Innoruk. I am a mere level 4, and am trying to deliver orders to the Bards who guard the North Gate and Docks of Qeynos. I  can not find the steps to reach the ramparts at the North Gate, and I can not find the Guard at the Docks. Can anyone help?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
Boru</div>
