<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976688192">Was hunting Forest Giants in Warsliks Woods this weekend and ran into an<br/>
unusual one.  As you may know most of them are typed, for example Forest<br/>
Giant Evergreen, Forest Giant Greenwood, Forest Giant Sapling, etc.  This<br/>
one was A Forest Giant.  When he attacked in addition to the usual &quot;I hate<br/>
Wood Elves&quot; there was some interesting text.<br/>
S<br/>
P<br/>
O<br/>
I<br/>
L<br/>
E<br/>

When attacking you got the following test message.<br/>
&quot;The forest giant covers up a pouch as if to not let something out&quot;<br/>
He then said.<br/>
&quot;You not get lizard, you get squished!&quot;<br/>
He didn&#39;t drop anything interesting so this may require a rogue or may be<br/>
part of a quest in some other way.  Anyone have any ideas?<br/>
