<div id="ygrps-yiv-946762767">There was a thread I read earlier but I&#39;m not sure it<br/>
was on this list.  The jist of the thread was, to<br/>
prevent disputes about loot, when a corpse is looted<br/>
you would see the following:<br/>
<br/>
PlayerX loots MobY&#39;s corpse<br/>
PlayerX sees a Black Pearl<br/>
PlayerX sees a Fine Steel Long Sword<br/>
PlayerX recieves 3pp 2gp 8sp 2cp<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t seem like it would be too hard to code<br/>
and would eliminate any dispute, assuming the person<br/>
doing the questioning was present at the time of the<br/>
looting.<br/>
