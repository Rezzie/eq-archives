<div id="ygrps-yiv-384480719">Actually, I noticed last night that there are now TWO boats on the Freeport to<br/>
Butcherblock route. The only way I found out was that a buddy of mine was coming<br/>
to freeport and we were talking. At the same time that he said the boat was<br/>
arriving at Butcherblock I heard the usual shouts that the boat was in Freeport.<br/>
I went and looked and sure enough there are 2 of them now.<br/>
<br/>
Hooray!<br/>

The boat between Freeport and Kaladim is running alot faster now (kinda a<br/>
shock--almost reported it as a bug after getting used to waiting 45<br/>
minutes for it).<br/>
