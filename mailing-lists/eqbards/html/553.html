<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918425866">I dont know about all the other bards out there, but I have never charged<br/>
for any service I can provide. Well, other than blacksmithing.<br/>
Anyways, the amount that is a reasonable charge is so small and paltry,<br/>
especially considering alot of the people I help are lower levels, that I<br/>
dont see it being worth it to charge them. Anyways, thats my view on it.<br/>

&gt;heres a topic tha should be rehashed i guess.  charging for our services,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i have escorted numerous people all over and no i do not charge for the<br/>
service.  i have found much like corpse location that i will usually gain a<br/>
donation and some sincere thanks.  and those people that i do work with are<br/>
usually willing to help me at a later date or even ask me to join a group<br/>
for a while.<br/>
