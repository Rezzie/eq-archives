<div id="ygrps-yiv-540396758">i don&#39;t think it&#39;s the level, but the person playing.  you don&#39;t have to be<br/>
a level 50 to be an ass.  guess we get a bad rap, but i try not to worry<br/>
about what everyone thinks about us generally and just try to be a good<br/>
person in game.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, as far as what to look forward to.  for one, you have the variety of<br/>
using all songs available.  second, you have the opportunity to group up and<br/>
adventure into any zone or dungeon.  third, other than deep in high level<br/>
dungeons (unless grouped up), it is nice to be able to walk around freely<br/>
without worry from those nasties you always were looking over your shoulder<br/>
for.<br/>

&gt; darker for all that&#39;s been said.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What can you tell us about 50th level that will make us want <br/>
&gt; to achieve it?<br/>
