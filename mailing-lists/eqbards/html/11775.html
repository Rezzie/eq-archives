1. The spell is a drop from a monster.<br/>
<br/>
2. The regeant can be bought from a vendor.<br/>
<br/>
No locations were given, the necro has to be in your group for the spell<br/>
to work, and the player&#39;s corpse closest to the necro is summoned.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a Summon Corpse spell.  Your corpse can be pulled from anywhere in<br/>
&gt; the current zone to the feet of the caster (necro I believe.)  Also rumored<br/>
&gt; to require a reagent (black enameled coffin???) not yet located on mobs or<br/>
&gt; vendors.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any info?<br/>

&gt; p.s. saw a post and person asked what mob in Paw dropped this spell. Not<br/>
&gt; sure if he meant spell or the reagent.<br/>
