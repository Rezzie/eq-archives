<b>Subject:</b> Hunting grounds - Guk? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-452610682">I have heard that Upper Guk can be a good hunting ground from teens all the<br/>
way up to high twenties. Is it possible for non-evil type races to go to<br/>
Guk or are they KOS? How does one go about getting to Guk from S. Ro?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help,<br/>
