<div id="ygrps-yiv-1951390309">I agree with the other comment, you should probably be<br/>
meditating while testing this.  Also, immediately after the<br/>
test you should cast a spell that takes a known amount of mana<br/>
in bubbles, to see if there is any phantom mana effect that&#39;s<br/>
making it appear as if you have more mana than you do.<br/>
