a half hours and got nothing, then got the greaves twice in 4<br/>
elites, then nothing for another hour and half after which I<br/>
left.  My friends stayed a couple more hours and got no more<br/>
greaves.<br/>

We ended up getting 1 2h-silvery axes, 1 1h-silvery axe, 3<br/>
Zaharn&#39;s coronets (had to let one rot since there were only<br/>
two of us at the time), 3 symbols of loyalty to Vox (I&#39;ve<br/>
never seen the king appear that many times in one night), 1<br/>
crystalline blade, and 2 frost totems.  But only 2 icy<br/>
greaves, go figure.<br/>
