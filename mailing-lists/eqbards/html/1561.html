&gt; Recently I&#39;ve been using the &quot;Jig&quot; (level 2 song I believe) to help mana<br/>
&gt; regrowth. I&#39;m not sure of the exact ammount (I&#39;ve heard 10%) but the<br/>
&gt; spell casters who group with me tell me that it does increase their rate<br/>
&gt; of regrowth, especially with my drum. So my theory is, it can&#39;t hurt<br/>
&gt; them with medding, they think it makes them med faster, they like me<br/>
&gt; more. Its all for the best.<br/>

meditating is really boring so she&#39;d already timed it and<br/>
figured out how it works.  She said every 8 seconds, you get a<br/>
chance to succeed at meditating.  If you succeed, your mana<br/>
jumps up by X amount (not sure how X is determined) - a pulse.<br/>
<br/>
With the Jig playing, it was about 6 seconds between each<br/>
meditation pulse.  These weren&#39;t attempts at accurate timings,<br/>
but the effect was obvious.  Using a drum made no difference -<br/>
6 seconds with or without.<br/>
