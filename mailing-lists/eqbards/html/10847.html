<div id="ygrps-yiv-314922524">greetings and forgive my ignorance but I have a question.<br/>
<br/>
What is the difference between the Level 22 Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody<br/>
and  Level 40 ( they say now works) Syvelians Anti-Magic Aura?<br/>
<br/>
I think if I remember right level 22 song removes only like dot type<br/>
negative effects on the party and 40th song removes  from target  one<br/>
enchantment bad or good from  target mob(or is it area?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Ahead of time<br/>
