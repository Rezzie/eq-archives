Someone put out a neat list of which Tae dropped which piece of rubicite. <br/>
This topic came up yesterday and even though I thought I had saved that <br/>
note, I can not seem to find it. Can someone send that back to me? I have <br/>
gone for the skald type bard in role play and am now heavily relied upon for <br/>
information like this. I can&#39;t believe I lost it!<br/>
I finally started working up piercing and it&#39;s definitely going to take <br/>
awhile to raise it, probably because it is equipped secondary. Just started <br/>
in the courtyard of Cazi, amazing lag and spam there!<br/>
Has anyone noticed the song vendor in HH having been moved? I went to get <br/>
song 23 last night and he was gone. I didn&#39;t have time for a full scale <br/>
search.<br/>
<br/>
May you live in interesting times,<br/>
