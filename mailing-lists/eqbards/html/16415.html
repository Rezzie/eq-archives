<div id="ygrps-yiv-14109404">Lt. Dagnor has gotten me a few times as well.  Also there is another corrupt<br/>
guard that is in the guard house near the gates.  I has camping at the gates<br/>
one night, when he decided to come out and play.  Ran like a newbie to the<br/>
zone line, lol.<br/>

  Plus, I&#39;m KOS to corrupt guards in Qeynos.  And Lt. Dagnor or<br/>
  whatever his name is doesn&#39;t mind dropping a 600 HT and 350 dmg<br/>
  per attack melee on you either.  So where are all these &#39;good&#39;<br/>
  guards?  Shouldn&#39;t they be standing up for me?  Yet another <br/>
  flaw of the faction system.<br/>
