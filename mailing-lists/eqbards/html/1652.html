<div id="ygrps-yiv-175100864">I have founf the lullaby great for going up against casters. If they miss <br/>
either save their spells get inturrepted.  Also it is handy for keeping <br/>
Charmed players from harming others or themselves.  I have saved many <br/>
players this way in the beholder maze and Qeynos Hills.<br/>
