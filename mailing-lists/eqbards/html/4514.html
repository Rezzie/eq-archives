<div id="ygrps-yiv-860208602">As far as I have noticed, we DO memorize our songs faster as we level.  When<br/>
you first got Hymn remember how long it took to mem it.  At level 21 I can<br/>
mem Hymn really fast, its just the level 21 song that takes forever to mem.<br/>

&gt; Well, for mages (yes I have an enchanter too - funny how they <br/>
&gt; seem to fill<br/>
&gt; the same slot in magic circles as we bards do) although I may <br/>
&gt; have trouble<br/>
&gt; deciding - it is INFINITELY easier to memorize spells, than songs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since we never get meditiate - our songs mem as slowly as the <br/>
&gt; day we get<br/>
&gt; them - THAT is a problem.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Besides the ONE song we have that DOES use manna, any reason <br/>
&gt; they can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; make our songs faster as we progress in skill?<br/>
