<div id="ygrps-yiv-713247824">as slow as experience goes at 51 (and each level after is supposed to be<br/>
harder than the last) i doubt i or a lot of others will ever see most of the<br/>
51+ songs.  i think i can make it to level 52, but if 52 is that much harder<br/>
than 51 and so on, i&#39;m never going to make 60.<br/>

&gt; Geoff poured a bunch of good ideas into the 51+ songs. We would <br/>
&gt; however be willing to entertain a discussion on this though.<br/>
