<div id="ygrps-yiv-796860685"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I now have a Minotaur horn which one of my friends gave me.  Does anyone<br/>
&gt;know what this is for?  It says it is a bard-only item, no stats except 0.1<br/>
&gt;weight.  I am not sure if it acts like an instrument or not, as I dont have<br/>
&gt;a song yet to possibly use this with.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a wind instrument.  You&#39;ll need it (or a Flute) for the Invisibility song.<br/>
