<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-457831896">Now that we have 10 banks of 10 social hotkeys each, its time to do some<br/>
serious macroing.  Does anyone have a list of all the macros they have for<br/>
bard songs?  If so please share them.  I tried to set up a macro for one<br/>
pulse of heal and two pulses of mana song.  Didn&#39;t do something right as<br/>
neither one of them ever started up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
