<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685303421"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; the druid said true?  Or am I<br/>
&gt; correct in my assumption that<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I believe he was healing the mob, probably by mistake. Playing a Cleric<br/>
before, I know it gets confusing having to select the party member to heal,<br/>
then re-selecting the mob you&#39;re fighting. If you&#39;re not agile with your<br/>
keyboard, it&#39;s easy to mess up.</div>
