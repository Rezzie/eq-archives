<div id="ygrps-yiv-1396021884">Several people here have written that we should be singing Elemental and<br/>
Guardian rhythms against Dragons.  Isn&#39;t it better to sing Guardian<br/>
Rhythms and Psalm of Warmth/Psalm of Cooling (as appropriate)?  Psalms<br/>
stack with Guardian, don&#39;t they?  I&#39;m not asking this rhetorically, I&#39;d<br/>
like to know what people think.<br/>
