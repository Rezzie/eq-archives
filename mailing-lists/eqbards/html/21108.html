<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106292098">My guild is having a war with a few guilds that we are aligned with. I&#39;ve <br/>
read some bard PvP stuff in the past from this list but it never pertained <br/>
to me as I never participate in PvP, so I thought I&#39;d ask for words of <br/>
bardly wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
This is all on a non-pvp server (Bertoxxulous) and I&#39;m a level 37 bard.<br/>
<br/>
I did have a few questions:<br/>
Did they nerf our ability to charm a player&#39;s pet?<br/>
Can you charm players in the arena?<br/>
Does our AOE fear work well?<br/>
<br/>
I do know that Bellows is excellent against casters, but don&#39;t wizzies cast <br/>
faster than bellows? Also, don&#39;t enchanters mez cast faster than bellows? <br/>
Right now, I mainly would be most concerned with opposing enchanters and bards.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>
