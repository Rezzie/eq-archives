		I would have made it through six hours without dying once,<br/>
and I <br/>
		got two bubbles net, anyway.  (I wouldn&#39;t have died at all<br/>
if the <br/>
		bleepity-bleep wizard had kept enough mana for an evac.  He<br/>
managed to med up  <br/>
		just in time to see me croak.)  (Well, I take it back - I<br/>
died 30 seconds into <br/>
		our very first fight.</div>
