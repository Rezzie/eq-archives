<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741102968"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; resistance to 111 (!), yet i was still unable to resist a single spell<br/>
&gt; &gt; from an evoker who conned white to me (out of about 12 spells). as noted<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the new 2.0 song guide, the spell shield seems to be non-existant. as a<br/>
&gt; &gt; result of my experience i can&#39;t even think why i should bother with magic<br/>
&gt; &gt; resistance at all, since i got ripped to shreds by force strike twice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What were the other 10 spells?  Magic resist only affects<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>oh, all 12 were force strikes; i just died twice from it. our cleric<br/>
couldn&#39;t heal me fast enough both times. :(</div>
