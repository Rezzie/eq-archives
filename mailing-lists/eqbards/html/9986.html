&gt;They really need to add an optional range limiter to tracking.<br/>
&gt;Sometimes I&#39;m pulling random stuff and just want what&#39;s<br/>
&gt;closest, sometimes I&#39;m looking for a rare mob and don&#39;t mind<br/>
&gt;wandering the entire zone looking for it.  Our tracking, being<br/>
&gt;in the middle, is a good compromise, but I wouldn&#39;t call it<br/>
&gt;the &quot;best.&quot;  There are many situations where a ranger is<br/>
&gt;better, and there are many situations where a druid is<br/>
&gt;better.<br/>

or Lower Guk all I can track is PCs and their pets haha.<br/>
