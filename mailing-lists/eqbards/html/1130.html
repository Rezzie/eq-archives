<div id="ygrps-yiv-499267357"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am an officer in the largest and arguably<br/>
&gt; oldest online gaming guild (The Syndicate www.thesyndicate.org )<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Sky Guild was founded in 1985 on Compuserve in the game Island of<br/>
Kesmai.  It has been in continuous operation, making forays in Drakkar, etc.<br/>
Until recently it was primarily based on Legends of Kesmai on Gamestorm.  It<br/>
is known as &quot;the Ancient Mystery of Sky&quot; in EQ on Povar.<br/>
<br/>
Most people don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; the meaning of the name...in medieval times a trade<br/>
guild was called a Mystery...guess the meaning of the word changed over<br/>
time. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
