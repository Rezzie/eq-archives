<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056482791">Has anyone had a chance to test whether these songs were secretly denerfed<br/>
in yesterday&#39;s patch?  I ran a couple of inconclusive tests yesterday.  In<br/>
one I was fairly successful against a low green.  Seemed to be less than 25%<br/>
resist.  I then tried it against a couple of high greens and it seemed to be<br/>
unchanged.<br/>
