We didn&#39;t find anything oh-aw spiffy.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, all three of those of us in there were item-twinked.<br/>
There was one magical item (BUrnyai Hide Sleeves) we got<br/>
off a greenie skeleton. Our monk could wear it, but<br/>
decided not to. i believe Druids could wear it too, so<br/>
bards probably could.<br/>

&gt;Anyone know if there is any interesting loot in Kurn&#39;s tower?  I was<br/>
&gt;thinking it might be a good place to look for Burynai Bundt Cake.  <br/>
&gt;Also some<br/>
&gt;of my guilds lower level member were thinking of trying it.<br/>
