Again, as my Ranger (with 800 hps) I once told my group to jump off the roof<br/>
if they get in trouble, but I told them to expect to lose a half bubble of<br/>
life (so jump before that). So the battle goes badly, and I start screaming<br/>
JUMP! JUMP! and our wizard with two bubbles of health jumps off and dies! :P<br/>
Of course, 115 damage is about two bubbles for him. :P<br/>
