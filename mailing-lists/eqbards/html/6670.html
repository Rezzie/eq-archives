<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019520319">Last night I was playing my Barbarian Shaman (who at level 9 can more often<br/>
than not drop yellow bugs/lions grizzlies *laughs*) and on I whim I clicked<br/>
my SoW icon. *poof* it was gone. So, although I might have been because I<br/>
was the caster,  you might want to double check if that didn&#39;t appear with<br/>
yesterdays downtime.<br/>
