like this is tough to do.  Whether it&#39;s random wandering mobs (even lower<br/>
level one&#39;s) or guards or bugged zones, any AE song could be dangerous.  The<br/>
only place so far I&#39;ve found to use this is fighting Broon.  His spawn is<br/>
safely out of the way of any wandering mobs.  I suppose in MM, I could<br/>
convince the party to fight in the middle of the GY so I don&#39;t affect any<br/>
mobs on the other sides of the walls, but I think they&#39;d give me evil looks<br/>
the first time we picked up a train standing out there.  : )<br/>
