<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557302494">To address the speculation on the Paw weapon:<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it can be wielded in either hand.  I currently am testing it in place <br/>
of my second ykesha... proc rate seems about the same as ykesha, but the <br/>
poison is pretty slow.  I like the +5 dex, and the weight in my offhand <br/>
isn&#39;t appreciably draining my stamina except in really really long fights. <br/>
The delay is a bit much, so I think soon I&#39;ll go back to my dual ykesha.  <br/>
The graphic is rather plain - looks like the Crystalline Blade (more of a <br/>
longish short sword than a long sword).<br/>
