amazing how quickly 5 harm touchs will make you go away.<br/>

Hi, Jacana!  You ARE awfully cute.  :)  I&#39;ll have to try that with my<br/>
favorite complaining Cleric.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure though, since I sank<br/>
like a lead balloon.  I only recall dying more quickly on one other occasion<br/>
(four MOBs hitting me<br/>
simultaneously in Sebilis).  I actually had time to type &quot;where&#39;s the damn<br/>
mez?&quot; and hit &lt;enter&gt; before I<br/>
croaked.</div>
