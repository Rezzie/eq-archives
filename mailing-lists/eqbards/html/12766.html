<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256862649"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; carrilon also, once I used it on a dubious and didn&#39;t get my flute<br/>
&gt; &gt; equipped before pulse, and she was only indifferent.  Repulsed with flute,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   I just logged on to test this.  I could only find apprehensive things.<br/>
   I could not locate anything dubious (where I was at).  Both with and<br/>
   without the flute, I could get apprehensive to amiable.  I&#39;ll try <br/>
   again later when my boss is not expecting some project to be on my <br/>
   screen.  I think the merchants near the guard tower in Rathe Mountains<br/>
   are dubious to me, I&#39;m right outside Oggok now, so the trip would be <br/>
   quick. ;)<br/>
