<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146441203">Wandering mobs are quite annoying.  At level 35, be ready to pickup a<br/>
considerable number of creatures while you are pulling...most of the<br/>
creatures in the zone started &quot;greening&quot; for me around lvl 53..so that would<br/>
put alot of them close to your level range.  The forager and hunter<br/>
themselves are lvl 45, double and triple hit for 100 plus.<br/>
