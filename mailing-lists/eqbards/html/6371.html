<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722948565">In MM we brought a level 18 Druid friend into our party.  The highest level<br/>
player was a 27 Magi.  She claimed to have gotten exp and good exp at that,<br/>
when we thought she wouldn&#39;t.  This is contrary to what I&#39;ve heard that at<br/>
level 20 you are first able to get exp with players 10 levels above you.<br/>
Maybe at 18 it&#39;s 9.... I really think this is something that Verant should<br/>
define for us.<br/>

&gt;Runneye in the warlords room tomorrow. The highest is a level 27 Shaman. I<br/>
&gt;know I won&#39;t be much use as for damage but I can add buffing and healing to<br/>
&gt;the mix easily. But can I group with them and get xp?<br/>
