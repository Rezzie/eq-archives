<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336894286">On a side note, that bug where no one in a zone/on a server can cast any<br/>
spells happened again last night on E&#39;ci.  Did anyone ever find out what<br/>
really causes this?  This is the second time I have seen it in a month.  Was<br/>
there any truth to the what seemed ridiculous rumor that this was caused by<br/>
multiple bards singing manasong?<br/>

Agreed.  Three bards in a group can be loads of fun.  Be sure to remind<br/>
everyone to turn their Partical Density setting as low as it can go.<br/>
Otherwise they may have massive lag due to all the songs that will be in<br/>
effect.<br/>
