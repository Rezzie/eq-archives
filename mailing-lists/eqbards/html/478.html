<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210539227">I now have a Minotaur horn which one of my friends gave me.  Does anyone<br/>
know what this is for?  It says it is a bard-only item, no stats except 0.1<br/>
weight.  I am not sure if it acts like an instrument or not, as I dont have<br/>
a song yet to possibly use this with.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect it is a quest item......<br/>
