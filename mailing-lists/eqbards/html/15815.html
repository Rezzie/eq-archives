bubbles a night (granted this was long ago, but it was still<br/>
crowded with about 60-80 people there).  Maybe I was fortunate<br/>
in not ending up grouped with boneheads.  I never /shouted<br/>
&quot;bard looking for a group.&quot;  I always found people I knew that<br/>
were there, and asked if they had room in their groups.<br/>
