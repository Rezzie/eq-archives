<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056574296">When our group is traveling, we need to use the Bard&#39;s Selo&#39;s.  (SInce<br/>
we have n druid/shaman).  It really pretty simple to keep everyone<br/>
together.  One person leads (who knows the run) and the rest follow. <br/>
The bard CANNOT lead.<br/>

We have run across antonica many times, with very few stops ever...  <br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
