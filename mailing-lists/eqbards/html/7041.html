<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048791199">A friend of mine has his heart set on getting one of these, and I can&#39;t<br/>
for the life of me (literally, on occasion) find where in Paw it comes<br/>
from.  If anyone has good, specific information on it, please email me<br/>
directly to keep offtopic discussion (mostly) off the list.<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>
