&gt; two Ice Giants, eh, Harmonic?), <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  That was just an extremely ugly pull.  Basically I went down <br/>
  fighting, back to back with a similar level ranger.  I finally<br/>
  died to two giant wooly spiders and an ice giant.  I don&#39;t even<br/>
  remember if we killed the priest or not.  But you seemed to <br/>
  attract you fair attention of one particular ice giant that <br/>
  was chasing you around as I recall  ;)<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic, the days of testing how tough perma ice giants were.</div>
