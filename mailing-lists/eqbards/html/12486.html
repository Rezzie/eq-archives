<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792322072">Ahh thanks, I was expecting an answer like, &quot;Due a &quot;not-a-bug&quot; if you<br/>
bellow some mob to death, you will forever be on its aggro list, even<br/>
after it dies...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heh I even tried to Bellow that TarantualaSaurus (the REALLY big spider<br/>
in S RO) to death.  (Considering real life fear of spiders, I would be<br/>
terrified to zone into S Ro again) I was on a kiting high after my first<br/>
kiting experience.  (A Dervsih Thug who aggroed on us after killing<br/>
another group).  Heh, that was fun :)  Tryinbg to explain what I was<br/>
doing to my newbie Shaman partner &quot;Just sit and the camp and Med!  I&#39;ll<br/>
run by with the derv soon, and you need to heal me&quot;<br/>
