<div id="ygrps-yiv-561684793">At 30th you have charm and pixie strike.<br/>
<br/>
Get good at charming in a group and convince the puller to pull two at a<br/>
time.  You will be able to kill them much faster than two seprate pulls.<br/>
<br/>
Pixie Strike is huge against caster mobs.  I was 29 in Dalinars and able to<br/>
keep those Kly Evokers from casting at all (with some help from a basher) in<br/>
most cases.  Thats very powerful.</div>
