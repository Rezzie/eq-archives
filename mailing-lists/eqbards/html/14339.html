<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121478422">First off, I like the list as much as the next person.  The negativity and<br/>
flames I can do with out BUT...<br/>
<br/>
No offence almighty dictator, but I am left wondering why Harmonic is<br/>
getting a warning for something that was clearly a personal e-mail between<br/>
two people and not this list.  SteelWolf should have never posted that to<br/>
the board.  It seems to me the wrong person got a warning.<br/>
<br/>
Rule #2<br/>
No Flaming.  Not all of us share the same opinion as you do, but please<br/>
be considerate of one another.  Take a moment to read through, and then<br/>
make sure someone hasn&#39;t already responded before posting hastily.  We&#39;re<br/>
all human, and no one likes to be called names.  If you simply MUST insult,<br/>
badger or degrade someone, DO IT PRIVATELY.<br/>
<br/>
Harmonic did this so what is the problem?<br/>

&gt;Harmonic, official warning for unnecessary flame.  I let the thread roll a <br/>
&gt;little because sometimes we all just need to vent once in a while - however <br/>
&gt;this shows that we don&#39;t have the maturity to discuss it without turning it <br/>
&gt;into a flame war.<br/>
