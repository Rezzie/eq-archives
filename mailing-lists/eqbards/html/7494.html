&gt; Kunark comes online with an evil city?  Will there be a place <br/>
&gt; for the good<br/>
&gt; races to bind or will Verant see it as a challenge for good players to<br/>
&gt; adventure there since its a boat ride from their nearest <br/>
&gt; reasonable bind<br/>
&gt; point if they aren&#39;t a binder?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yes, there will be a high elf city zone on the continent as well.<br/>
