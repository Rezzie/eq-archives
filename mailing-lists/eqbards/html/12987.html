&gt;   Needless to say, I was the only bard on the plane at the time.<br/>
&gt;   Unfortunately, I have to wait until Maestro drops another, since<br/>
&gt;   the weapon was &#39;accidentally&#39; looted by someone who cannot use it.<br/>
&gt;   &lt;sigh&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Do you use your evensong over your yk, Shada?<br/>
