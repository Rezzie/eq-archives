<div id="ygrps-yiv-979544206">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am a lvl 17 bard trying to find a good place to hunt.  I am mostly around<br/>
Oasis but willing to travel for exp and loot.  I need a good place with<br/>
decent amount of plp to group with.  I tried Unrest, and Highpass.  It seems<br/>
that no one wants a bard because we attract too much attentions.  Please<br/>
give suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Thnx,<br/>
