IMHO a rule of thumb for me on whether I expect my<br/>
box to run Win2k well .. did the makers of my cards drivers have WinNT<br/>
drivers for them?  If so .. its a good bet they had a jump on 2K drivers.<br/>

That was part of why I went with ME.  My old PC is dual boot NT & 95.  EQ<br/>
never ran on the NT side.  I didn&#39;t want to have that problem with 2K.<br/>
<br/>
But as far as not having a problem with ME in the two months I&#39;ve had<br/>
it...my PC crashed twice last night (not in EQ though).  I think Kitasi&#39;s<br/>
coworkers jinxed me.  :P<br/>
