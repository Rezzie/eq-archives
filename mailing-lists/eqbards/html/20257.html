<div id="ygrps-yiv-147653992">i don&#39;t know if that bard is the same as me.  i know i can fear kite or<br/>
chant kite a melee class and win a duel.  the only reason i duel is for fun,<br/>
and it&#39;s fun for me to test out my melee abilities and songs to see how i<br/>
can stack up against a melee class.  sure i can take out casters pretty<br/>
easily most of the time but the most fun i have is trying to beat a melee<br/>
ability by standing up to them.  i can come pretty close with rangers and<br/>
less-than great equipped warriors.  i just love killing rogues and am very<br/>
good at it.  monks are just scary though hehe.  this was mostly at 50, the<br/>
51+ disciplines make the rogues, monks, and warriors downright impossible,<br/>
but i still try for fun.  i personally refuse to kite in duels.  i know i<br/>
can win but it&#39;s not as fun =)  now if that 54 bard thought he could win, i<br/>
understand your point.  i never expect to win melee duels against melee<br/>
classes, but hell if i will run from them!<br/>
