<div id="ygrps-yiv-360895298">I&#39;m really finding this hard to believe.  What is the point of having Charisma the<br/>
primary statistic for bards and enchanters if the only effect it has in game is better<br/>
prices with merchants?  I wish J.M. was still around to answer the question to this<br/>
one.<br/>

        That&#39;s another thing that Brad told us last night. Charisma has nothing to<br/>
do with MOB&#39;s resisting magic.<br/>
