&gt; I have a newbie question to ask.  I have recently gained Level 12 and have<br/>
&gt; been experimeting with bellow.  I had a few questions such as: is it a DD or<br/>
&gt; AE song and if I bellow one creature can it effect others such that they<br/>
&gt; will follow along and attack me.  I wanted to know a little about the<br/>
&gt; possible strategies that people use with this song.  Thanks for all your<br/>
&gt; help.<br/>

knives, it is probably your first ranged attack, so you&#39;ll<br/>
probably end up discovering new things about mob AI when you<br/>
use ranged attacks.  Like even if you are outside their aggro<br/>
radius, if they have friends nearby and you Bellow one, they<br/>
will all come.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the standard extra damage, the song is useful for<br/>
killing runners, as it&#39;s ranged (no more annoying &quot;you can&#39;t<br/>
hit your target from here&quot;), and you don&#39;t have to be standing<br/>
still to use it like spellcasters do.<br/>
