<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982638837">I have never fought what is now an &quot;uber mob&quot;.  However, according to people<br/>
on this list (and others) they take in the range of 10 minutes to kill.<br/>
Which means med times matter.  SO why wouldn&#39;t having a bard in the wizard<br/>
group be useful?<br/>
<br/>
I am assuming that resist rates are useless on these mobs...<br/>
