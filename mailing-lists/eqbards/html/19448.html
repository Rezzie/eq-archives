<br/>
The &quot;Test of&quot; events are unavailable to bards. That&#39;s why I brought the<br/>
whole thing up. There isn&#39;t a single &quot;Test of&quot; that we can participate in.<br/>

In specific terms I was referring to the &quot;Test of&quot; events.  If they are<br/>
geared towards rewarding the best bard on the server, then IMO level should<br/>
not be a factor.</div>
