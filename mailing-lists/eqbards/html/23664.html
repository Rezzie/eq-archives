<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I really shudder when I hear people recommend that you <br/>
&gt; reformat your drive <br/>
&gt; to install a new OS.  Sure, if the drive&#39;s data is totally <br/>
&gt; trashed, that may <br/>
&gt; be the way to go.  But if you would end up losing tons of data by <br/>
&gt; reformatting (and honestly, how many people actually have a <br/>
&gt; backup device <br/>
&gt; other than their floppy drives at home???) the easiest way to <br/>
&gt; do a fresh OS <br/>
&gt; install is just to rename the Windows and Program Files directories. </span></blockquote></div>
