<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090644622">Someone ranted awhile ago on that board about threads closed with no<br/>
comment and the response was that the board itself is set to<br/>
auto-close threads with &gt; x number of responses or bytes in the<br/>
thread.  If the board moderator catches it, the thread will usually<br/>
get split.  Honestly, I wish they&#39;d switch to a board that doesn&#39;t<br/>
move threads to the top when they get responded to.  That whole<br/>
bumping thing can get really annoying.  It invites people to just sit<br/>
and bump the threads and not really add anything to the thread.<br/>
Writing threads on that board is just a popularity contest.  If I had<br/>
something really important that I wanted someone to read, I&#39;d email it<br/>
either to Gordon or to Baelish rather than post it there.  This has<br/>
been my rant for the morning.<br/>
