<div id="ygrps-yiv-741383137">Paw dungeon in south karana -- rarely has more that 10 people in it (on The<br/>
Rathe at least) and has decent loot. It&#39;s actually good (solo or grouped) from<br/>
level 6 to 18 or so. The down side is that it is a long way from anything. You<br/>
can sell at the gypsies in north karana, but the nearest bank is in qeynos or<br/>
highkeep.<br/>
