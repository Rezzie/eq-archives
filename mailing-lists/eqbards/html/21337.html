<div id="ygrps-yiv-852455510">You go on vacation for a week and wow, this list went crazy.. had like 160<br/>
eqbard emails.  So forgive me but i deleted a lot of them.  If anything<br/>
REALLY important happened and you&#39;re bored, send me a note and give the the<br/>
condensed scoop :)<br/>
 <br/>
On the positive side, played my bard for the first time in a LONG time, it<br/>
was a blast :)<br/>
Got level 28 and played in Dalnir, first time in a dungeon really :)  I was<br/>
scardededed.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, hope you&#39;re all well!<br/>
