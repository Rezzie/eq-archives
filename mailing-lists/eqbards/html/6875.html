<div id="ygrps-yiv-455860965">Can you (one) make more hot keys than you have socials?  Is there a point<br/>
where you run out of socials to customize?<br/>
<br/>
I have made a bunch and they seem to be limited to the number of socials<br/>
that can be displayed in the socials screen.  Or is there a way to make more<br/>
of them?<br/>
<br/>
With new pet commands, I am worried I am gonna run out of socials to<br/>
customize.<br/>
