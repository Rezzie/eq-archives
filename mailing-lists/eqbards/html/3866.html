<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170661875">Ok heres my problem...2 months ago i hit the hide button and the thing<br/>
never recycled back through.  Well, when i recieved the sneak skill two<br/>
lvls ago, i put 3 points into it hoping to try it out...nothing.  The<br/>
hide skill is not allowing me to use it.  So i thought maybe if i put<br/>
some more points into the sneak skill it would cycle the button through<br/>
faster.  It didn&#39;t.  So far i have put 8 skill points into sneak and<br/>
have not been able to use it once.  Is this normal?  or do you all think<br/>
that maybe mine is screwed up?<br/>
