Being 17th level and new to the sneak<br/>
skill.. Can someone tell me what it&#39;s<br/>
good for? I try to practice it as often<br/>
as possible but a few things I&#39;ve noticed:<br/>
<br/>
1. How do you know if you&#39;re successful?<br/>
2. How long does it last if you are?<br/>
3. It appears you can&#39;t sneak if you&#39;re<br/>
   playing any song. Is this correct?<br/>
4. Do we have a skill cap on it?<br/>
5. What&#39;s it good for?</div>
