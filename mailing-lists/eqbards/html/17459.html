<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045598254">Hi Everyone!<br/>
<br/>
With the arrival of level 26 and Area effect Fear, my strategy will most<br/>
likely change.  I was thinking of using, Snare, Fear, Dot... and repeat<br/>
the cycle.<br/>
<br/>
Also, since at 27 we get charm, what creature do you suggest I play with<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>
<br/>
