&gt; I did the quest.  Carrillion took my faction high enough for it to work.  I<br/>
&gt; was indifferent to start and he wouldn&#39;t give it to me.  After playing the<br/>
&gt; song he changed his tune though.  I don&#39;t think you need to do the first<br/>
&gt; part of the quest, but I did it anyway just to be sure.  Not like its very<br/>
&gt; hard, I was able to get off the boat, kill the cat, and get back on the boat<br/>
&gt; before it departed.<br/>
