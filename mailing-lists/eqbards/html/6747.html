<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194510632"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;One other possibility.  Are we 100% certain that the song <br/>
&gt;is supposed to remove negative buffs from us?  What if the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>110% sure.  This song is party only.  Kinda tough to apply it<br/>
to NPCs, when it&#39;s _only_ party only.  The static pulse is<br/>
meant to clear out negative effects (which it doesnt).<br/>
<br/>
I incorrectly posted that I got it to work before.  It was<br/>
pure coincidence.  By the time I mem&#39;d the song, and put the<br/>
lute in my hand, the second I played it the debuffs on me faded.<br/>
It was _not_ duplicated the second or third time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;on you either when sung or with the lute equipped.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This song is lute _only_, you cannot sing it.<br/>
We need to be more careful when posting things like this,<br/>
clearly you can tell if you get the message:<br/>
<br/>
You must be using a String Instrument when playing this song.<br/>
<br/>
In order to make more sense of things like this, everyone needs<br/>
to take note of everything that occured.  Saying this song can<br/>
be sung is just plain incorrect.  It starts more rumors, which<br/>
we must dispell... it&#39;s ashame this song does help that ;-)<br/>
