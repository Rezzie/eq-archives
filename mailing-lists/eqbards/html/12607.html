<div id="ygrps-yiv-279865690">Well, here you have it straight from the EQ team themselves.  In an excerpt<br/>
from the test server:<br/>
<br/>
Solution: <br/>
<br/>
Ideally, Feign Death should work like Invisibility, where summoned pets<br/>
suicide and the charmed ones break Charm.  We do not want, however, to<br/>
adversely affect lower level Necromancers to such a large degree.  What we<br/>
do recognize is the need to prevent higher level Necros from exploiting key<br/>
spawn points.  Hence, when you Feign Death, any charmed NPC will immediately<br/>
break Charm.  However, summoned NPCs (pets) will not be affected.  While<br/>
this still allows the use of the Feign Death tactic with your summoned pet,<br/>
it does not imbalance the game and many dungeon spawns to the degree that<br/>
charming an NPC does. <br/>
<br/>
We would appreciate diligent testing of this change, to insure that no<br/>
unforeseen problems have been caused by it.  <br/>

So now they are saying they would appreciate diligent testing of a change?<br/>
Wtf?  Who is the customer and who is the service provider here?  I guess<br/>
this tells us everything we need to know about Verant test procedure.  Throw<br/>
the code out on the test server and hope some player puts it to task.<br/>
