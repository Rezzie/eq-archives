 </span></blockquote>Actually, it&#39;s odd. Until very very recently this list was populated with<br/>
discussion of how to get the most from the class not complaining about what<br/>
how it was nerfed, broken, ignored, unattended to.<br/>
As the latest patches did not change us radically (SoW/Selos/Root/chain have<br/>
been messed up in different ways forever), it must be some other factor at<br/>
work.<br/>
