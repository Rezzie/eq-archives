<div id="ygrps-yiv-709475510">Sylly is dead on with those suggestions, but one thing I want to point out<br/>
is that if you are charming in Kunark, it helps immensely to charm a mob of<br/>
a different type from the one you will be attacking.  What I mean is if you<br/>
want to kill a sarnak, charm a burynai or goblin and not another sarnak.<br/>
Why?  It seems that like mobs in Kunark will not automatically other like<br/>
mobs.  This means that you have to order your pet to attack the target<br/>
everytime you charm your pet (or let the target hit you once after every<br/>
charm).<br/>
 <br/>
Another important thing about charming in Kunark is that all iksar mobs are<br/>
immune to charm.  At least, I&#39;ve never heard of anyone getting charm to<br/>
stick on an iksar.<br/>
