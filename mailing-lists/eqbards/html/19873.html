<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126208471">This is how it worked for me. I was heading to Qeynos<br/>
  to train dual wield. But I figured I&#39;d try and see if I<br/>
  could at least equip two weapons now that I was 17 --<br/>
  and I could! Then I got attacked by a bear on my way<br/>
  through North Karana... and I got a Dual wield increase!<br/>
  YAY! I still had to go back to Qeynos, though -- songs and<br/>
  more throwing daggers.<br/>
<br/>
  - I wish I knew that before :)  Oh well.  Dual wield is working a charm...<br/>
