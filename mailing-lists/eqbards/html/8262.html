<div id="ygrps-yiv-296091017">I&#39;ve seen them go for as low as 20PP and as high as 50PP.  I paid 30PP for<br/>
mine.  If you are in GFay or Crushbone, I would think you could get one<br/>
lower than 40PP.  On Antonica, 40PP would be reasonable.  <br/>

&gt; Where do you recommend I auction? Is 40pp reasonable? Thanks!<br/>
