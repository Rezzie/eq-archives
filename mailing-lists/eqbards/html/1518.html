<div id="ygrps-yiv-769976589">In reference to a previous thread we had running here for a while, I<br/>
expressed a concern that Hand to Hand was capped at 40 for bards...I wanted<br/>
to be able to play an instrument and still participate in melee to some<br/>
degree at times so this concerned me.  Last night I noticed my Hand to Hand<br/>
skill raised from 39 to 43 and seems to be still going.<br/>
