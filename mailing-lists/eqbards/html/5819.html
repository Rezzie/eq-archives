I was experimenting with DDD in East Freeport, munching rats, bats, snakes<br/>
and fire beatles, and I noticed an overwhelming tendency for the corpse to<br/>
just up and vanish.  Then, last night in Unrest, we had a particularly<br/>
tough combat with a Skeletal Monk, and the Necro in our party hit it with a<br/>
DoT - darned if the blasted corpse didn&#39;t vanish!  And it was my loot, too<br/>
:(  Things went downhill from there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - um - the Bard-related point here is that, apparently, DDD *is*<br/>
treated as a DoT, so I imagine Chords are, too, thus Bards may in fact be<br/>
affected by the Kiting changes.  Hrmph - good thing we&#39;re so awesome at<br/>
everything else ;)<br/>
