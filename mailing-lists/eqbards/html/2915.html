ranged weapons except bows do pathetic damage, and we can&#39;t<br/>
use bows.  You will just have to chase it until you get Bellow<br/>
at L12, and Chain at L23.<br/>

good luck getting one.  There is no difference between the<br/>
lute and mandolin other than weight and price.  Verant was<br/>
planning to have the two have slightly different effects on<br/>
the stringed instrument songs, but never got around to<br/>
implementing it.<br/>
