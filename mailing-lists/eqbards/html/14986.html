<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376163197">My cleric got jboots last night.  I would like to publicly thank<br/>
Sylly for training cyclops arounded rathe mountains while I did my quest.<br/>
And I know both of us came out of this experience with one gem of<br/>
knowledge:<br/>
<br/>
	Screech does indeed affect Hasten Bootstrutter.<br/>
<br/>
	That was the most interesting chase I&#39;ve had in a long time :).<br/>
