and group gate you out.  there is no zone out, the gate is one-way.  you<br/>

&gt; Oh, BTW I used my 13th level gnome magician to run around in <br/>
&gt; there because i<br/>
&gt; wanted to bind inside in case I got killed so I would not <br/>
&gt; have to run all<br/>
&gt; the way back. =) SCARY! (is that a run-on?)<br/>
