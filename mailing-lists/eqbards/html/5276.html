<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-195320480">Well, I went out and bought my steele breastplate this<br/>
weekend.  I had a charisma of 118 and bought it from<br/>
Kelethin, my home city, I got it for about 757pp.  My<br/>
ranger friend checked what his price would be just to<br/>
see, and it was over 900 for him.  Also I noticed that<br/>
it isn&#39;t size specific.  No medium or large to it. <br/>
Pretty cool, eh?</div>
