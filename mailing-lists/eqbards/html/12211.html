<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031572475">I&#39;ve developed a spreadsheet that will display the numerical values of songs based upon your level.  It makes a nice cheat sheet when trying to figure out what songs to play in a given party/situation.  It also displays known compatibility issues with other songs/spells, which I can never seem to keep track of :)<br/>

Rokenn has graciously posted it at his excellent Bard Song Analysis site(the source of all the formulas and tables):<br/>
