11 dmg 23 delay, got it from a friend, but I believe its found in sol B. (not really sure).  Primary only weapon.<br/>
<br/>
note: this is all off the top of my head, eq&#39;lizer is down for me, so check there for confirmation.<br/>

Crystal staves.. yeah, novelty weapon, never used in actual battle. Although, great for starting a new character, when the lvl 1 procs actually effect the mob&#39;s :)</div>
