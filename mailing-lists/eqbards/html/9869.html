Funny anecdote.  A friend of mine was running from a train and<br/>
managed to zone.  You know how mobs can still hit you for a<br/>
while after you&#39;ve zoned and you come out with fewer hp than<br/>
when you hit the zone?  Well, apparently one of the mobs<br/>
rooted my friend during this interval.  He came out safe on<br/>
the other side, but rooted.<br/>
