I will however likely have songs memmed to bail them out in the event they<br/>

Now if there is no enchanter in the group and the bard can&#39;t perform basic<br/>
crowd control because he doesn&#39;t know how, then you have a case.<br/>

Ask them to keep 2 targets mezzed and they look at you funny.  In short, the<br/>
bards I&#39;m grouping with seem so clueless about their class that they&#39;re<br/>
actually detrimental to the group.<br/>
