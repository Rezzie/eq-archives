<div id="ygrps-yiv-536333924">*sheesh!*  Listen to you old farts! ;)  I&#39;m 30 (31 in about 6 weeks) and<br/>
don&#39;t have nearly the problems twisting in EQ as I had playing Diablo a few<br/>
years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to keep my fingers fairly flat on the number keys and only make<br/>
slight movements to start and stop songs.  It&#39;s my right hand that has<br/>
troubles... clawed around that mouse for hours on end can be a bit of a<br/>
strain.<br/>
<br/>
Ooh!  It&#39;s getting dark.  Time to go home.</div>
