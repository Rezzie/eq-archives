<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-80038017">So we all know Lullaby should clear, wipe out, a MOB&#39;s shit list when it&#39;s<br/>
slept.  Interesting thing happened.  I was running through the commonlands,<br/>
and a mage passed me going the opposite direction with a dervish in tow,<br/>
slapping him the while.  I quickly halted and fired up Lullaby.<br/>
<br/>
The dervish fell asleep.  The mage, quite weakened, continued walking<br/>
towards the zone border.  He actually got to the point where the dervish,<br/>
whom at that point I saw was very low on health also, was no longer right on<br/>
his tail.  But then came a paladin who had been running to catch up with<br/>
them apparently.  He swiped the dervish, dumb paladin, waking him up.<br/>
<br/>
At this point the dervish should attack me, or maybe the paladin.  Instead<br/>
the MOB continued after the mage, who was a good distance away by now!<br/>
After it got in a few more swipes at this poor PC, the mage zoned.  It then<br/>
proceeded to fight the paladin.  Well, irritated at this paladin for almost<br/>
getting the other fellow killed, I bellowed twice and stole his kill.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Point of all this: If lullaby -does- nix the shit list, why did it go after<br/>
the mage?  Obviously the mage had done a great deal of damage to it, so it<br/>
really hated him.  But a nix is a nix, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
