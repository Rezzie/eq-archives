<div id="ygrps-yiv-226742677">After our successful hit on Nagafen we decided to take on Lady Vox and the<br/>
Ice Giants last night.<br/>
<br/>
One complete heal (doh!)  One Superior Heal (Does that mean she was low on<br/>
mana?) and 6 dead adventurers later, she fell.  I guess the dragon support<br/>
our bard plight with Verant as she also dropped her insturment, and this<br/>
time, yours truly was given the horn!  Gotta love the stats on this thing,<br/>
but it bears a question.<br/>
<br/>
When will I ever use it?  I haven&#39;t pulled out my horn (except to max my<br/>
brass skill) since lvl 23 I think...<br/>
<br/>
