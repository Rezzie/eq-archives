<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092240208">I think Baelish was going to be out a couple of weeks.<br/>
 He has someone that was updating the website for him<br/>
while he was gone.  Not sure if he was answering<br/>
Baelish&#39;s email in the meantime.  If you go to<br/>
EQCasters, you will see that &quot;Graffe&quot; is updating<br/>
right now.  So you may have to be patient until<br/>
Baelish gets back from his &quot;trip&quot;.<br/>

&gt; &gt; With your thread on the EQ Boards up to almost 8<br/>
&gt; pages, have you forwarded<br/>
&gt; &gt; your information to Baelish yet?  If so did you<br/>
&gt; get any feedback from him?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, I mailed it to Baelish Friday morning.  I<br/>
&gt; assume he<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t get to it then, and due to the holiday this<br/>
&gt; is a long<br/>
&gt; weekend.  Patience, grasshopper.  :)<br/>
