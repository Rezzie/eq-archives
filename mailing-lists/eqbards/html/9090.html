than half the servers).  Ping times and PL were fine, but<br/>
/tells took up to 10 seconds to get through.  Most network<br/>
systems are designed to dynamically respond to load by<br/>
decreasing update frequency (so you don&#39;t exceed available<br/>
bandwidth).  When that happens in a game like this, moving<br/>
entities appear to blink in and out of existence as the client<br/>
and server get out of synch.<br/>
