also allows you to see through invisibility.  I used to sing it to find <br/>
out whether any of my favorite KSing Wizards were hiding in the rooms <br/>
with us in High Keep.  I am pretty certain that infravision does not see <br/>
invisible, since I believe it is the same as my native Half-Elf <br/>
infravision.<br/>

PS - Playing my non-infravision characters, the worst vision spot I&#39;ve <br/>
found so far is the zone tunnel between Everfrost and Blackburrow.  I <br/>
finally got the turns memorized, but that tunnel is LONG and DARK.</div>
