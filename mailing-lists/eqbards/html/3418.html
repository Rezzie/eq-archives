&gt; Well I was fooling around, and I got rooted in a dungeon(selo&#39;s doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; work, but can still break root), and the selo&#39;s did not break the root.<br/>
&gt; I forgot to try chain, as I didn&#39;t have it memmed at the moment.<br/>

Runnyeye that qualify as &quot;underground&quot; do not allow Selo&#39;s to take hold, so the<br/>
root would not be broken.<br/>
