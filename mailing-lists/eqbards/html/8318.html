<br/>
Don&#39;t you think that the Burned Out Lightstones are NO DROP<br/>
like any other NO DROP Items that are Quest related? Although<br/>
I don&#39;t know and I&#39;m not sure, I think there is a Quest for them.<br/>
<br/>
While traveling at full speed in West Common somebody was<br/>
buying the Burned out lightstones... Yes BUYING... He said<br/>
that he knew they were NO DROP but said there was a way to<br/>
transfer them anyway. So why would a guy go thru all that trouble<br/>
for useless items? Anyone have an idea?<br/>
<br/>
To say that all those Lightstones messages started with my Elf Hide<br/>
Gloves question where I used the Wisp as an example ;-)<br/>
