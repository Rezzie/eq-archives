<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183676395"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Why would the trip from Qeynos to Freeport take 45<br/>

&gt; We discussed this in a previous thread.  He suffers from<br/>
&gt; enormous lag (500-600 ms) which causes him to Selo-run<br/>
&gt; almost as slow as normal people run, and makes for 4-6<br/>
&gt; minute zone times.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re obviously thinking of someone else. You claimed in<br/>
one of your replies that I must have a lot of lag. I never<br/>
said that, nor agreed with you. I have cable modem service<br/>
and don&#39;t have 500-600 ms lag. I don&#39;t &quot;selo-run almost<br/>
as slow as normal people run&quot;. My average ping is about<br/>
150 and my average zone time is around a minute.<br/>
<br/>
If you think you can make it from Qeynos to Freeport in<br/>
20 minutes I&#39;d love to see you do it.</div>
