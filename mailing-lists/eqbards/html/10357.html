You do make a good point though - time is irrelevant in this<br/>
case (unlike with Bellow, where time determined how many<br/>
Bellows you could get in).  Chain reduces damage by 30%<br/>
regardless of time, Psalm applies damage per hit, regardless<br/>
of time.  So you can do this comparison based entirely on<br/>
damage/hit and hit%.<br/>
