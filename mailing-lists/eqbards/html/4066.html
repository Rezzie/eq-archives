<br/>
Yeah ... this was one of the things on the Bards&#39; Petition: the<br/>
inexplicable monster frenzy effect our songs have on all monsters in<br/>
a zone.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that our music is not musical to monster ears.  Hey, if a<br/>
dog was singing a seranade outside my window, I&#39;d throw a flower pot<br/>
at it too.<br/>
<br/>
And, sound does travel longer over enclosed areas, so singing<br/>
outdoors is not as bad as singing indoors.<br/>
<br/>
However, what does become irritating is the fact that the monsters<br/>
will continually attack the bard in the group despite the fact that a<br/>
wizard just unloaded 200 points of damage into it.  By the time you<br/>
turn the music off, you&#39;re so weak that the monsters target you for<br/>
that reason instead!<br/>
<br/>
If I had to choose between attacking the dog howling his lungs off<br/>
and the dog who&#39;s biting my foot, I&#39;d attack the foot-biter ...<br/>
<br/>
... of course, maybe the monster was being extremely intelligent in<br/>
targeting that one member in the party that lets the party survive a<br/>
dungeon crawl with little downtime.</div>
