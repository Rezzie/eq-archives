I am looking for the Elfhide Gloves in Upper Guk. These are the +5 Agi and<br/>
+5 dex gloves useble ONLY by Bards and Rogues. I was TOLD that they are on<br/>
someone named &quot;The Warden&quot;, who is supposedly the Warden of the jail cells<br/>
in Upper Gukk. My group camped there for QUITE a long time this evening and<br/>
never saw him once. Does anyone know exaclty where he spawns? Is there some<br/>
sort of trigger? We kept seeing Knights and Warriors, but never a Warden.<br/>
<br/>
We are ALSO looking for the trollhide belt. Again, I was told this SAME<br/>
invidual bears it. Is this true? If not, who has it, and where? And of<br/>
course, is this ALSO a Bard/Rogue only item?<br/>
<br/>
THANK YOU for any help you can provide!<br/>
