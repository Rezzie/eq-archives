&gt; The latest newbie beg: I have gotten tells twice now from <br/>
&gt; bards under L10 <br/>
&gt; asking if I would mind getting them a set of lambent armor. <br/>
&gt; That would be <br/>
&gt; taking generosity to new heights.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heh, I&#39;m level 11 and will settle for banded.  [bats eyelashes and smiles<br/>
sweetly]  ;^)<br/>
<br/>
My bard hasn&#39;t gotten begged since her name went blue.  My rogue&#39;s name is<br/>
still purple though and she still gets begged.  Heck, don&#39;t these people<br/>
know patchwork and bucklers when they see them?<br/>
