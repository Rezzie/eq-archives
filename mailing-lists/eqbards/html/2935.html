<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827125996">Greetings all!  I hope everyone is having a great Independance Day<br/>
weekend.  Just wanted to let you know that I finally gathered up enough<br/>
strength to wretch myself away from EverQuest long enough to update the Bard<br/>
Song Analysis.  So much stuff has been added since v1.6 that I decided to go<br/>
ahead and make the new version v2.0.  I&#39;ve also got a better way of<br/>
distributing the document as well.  The good people at the EQ Bardic Guide<br/>
have been kind enough to post it at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.harpers.net/bard">http://www.harpers.net/bard</a> .<br/>
     I just wanted to say that this mailing list has been a vaulable soure<br/>
of<br/>
information to this document. I&#39;d like to say &#39;thank you&#39; to everyone who<br/>
has<br/>
contributed to any of the meaningful discussions here.<br/>
