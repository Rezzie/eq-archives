<div id="ygrps-yiv-928092873">Last night in Karnor&#39;s my group pulled two drolvarg sentries so I tried to<br/>
charm one.  I had nine missed notes in a row before I got charm to finally<br/>
go off (which the mob promptly resisted).  I&#39;ve never had such bad luck with<br/>
missed notes in the past.  Anyone had more than nine in a row before?<br/>
