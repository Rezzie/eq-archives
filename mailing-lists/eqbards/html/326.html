<div id="ygrps-yiv-479586744">Man , you guys should be lawyers, not bards..... first, one group attacks<br/>
the other group, then the other group attacks back and refutes what the<br/>
first group said.  Come on people, jeez can&#39;t we all just get along?  Who<br/>
cares what the soerbaird do or don&#39;t do, that is there biz and does nothing<br/>
to reflect on you.  And to the soerbaird,  So what if someone rags on your<br/>
group, your a wellknown guild and people are gonna take potshots sometimes.<br/>
I&#39;m gonna get lots of flames but can you PLEASE  get over your differences?<br/>
IT IS A GAME!<br/>
