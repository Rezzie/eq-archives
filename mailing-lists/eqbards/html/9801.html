<br/>
WHY DO I NEED CHARISMA<br/>
Spoke with GZ this morning regarding Charisma and its effect in relation to<br/>
resists. <br/>
<br/>
In summary Charisma effects the resists of Charms, Mesmerises and Blur-Type<br/>
Spells across all classes.<br/>
<br/>
Charisma will not lower resist rates of debuff spells, slow spells, direct<br/>
damage spells, or DoT&#39;s. <br/>
