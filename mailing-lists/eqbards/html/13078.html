These drop in Castle Mistmoore at night when you&#39;re camping the Mistmoore<br/>
Battle Drums.  In a three hour camp we accumulated probably four or five<br/>
werewolf claws.<br/>

&gt; werewolf too (for the lupine claw gauntlets quest).<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, we didn&#39;t know at the time how rare these were<br/>
&gt; (we got it on the first werewolf we ever killed), and traded<br/>
&gt; the gauntlets away.  I&#39;ve killed over 50 werewolves since, and<br/>
&gt; not seen another one.<br/>
