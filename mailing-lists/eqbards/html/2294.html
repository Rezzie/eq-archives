<div id="ygrps-yiv-279182363">As to the discussion about Selos and root breaking, when I first read about <br/>
selo&#39;s breaking root (on this list btw Thanks), I was routinely camping in <br/>
Befallen basement for BBC&#39;s for my warrior guildmates. The ghouls rooted us <br/>
alot and so I explained to them I wanted to see if selo&#39;s could break it <br/>
indoors as well as outdoors. They would holler rooted and I would hit Selos <br/>
and they seemed to get free even though the song would abort with the <br/>
traditional message, &quot;you can&#39;t do that indoors&quot;. It is very difficult to <br/>
test this under battle conditions but it sure seemed to work for all of us <br/>
in the party.<br/>
