My bard was supposed to be a test drive, thought<br/>
I was going to go a few levels and start my &quot;real&quot;<br/>
character.<br/>
 <br/>
Every time I try to start a new char, I keep coming<br/>
back to my bard.  Fortuanately I distributed my<br/>
points fairly evenly between str (85) agi (95) dex (95)<br/>
and cha (95)<br/>

The more I think about it, the more I think I got it <br/>
pretty close to right the first time<br/>
