<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060389333">1. PROC - Perpetual Randomness Of Casting<br/>
2. Think of Loc as the incredibly generous minor god of geology who answers<br/>
all prayers to him (/loc) by giving the person in question their<br/>
co-ordinates (which he used when drawing up the blueprints for Norrath)<br/>
Now, can we get away from nit-picking personal prefernces in gaming-styles<br/>
and back to more bard-ish stuff?<br/>
3. A truly hardcore RP&#39;r would quit the game and never play again once he<br/>
died (or, if he really liked the game and believed re-incarnation were<br/>
possible on Norrath, would never inform anyone -even friends- of his new<br/>
character&#39;s identity.)<br/>
Like maybe...  &quot;What is the benefit/loss (if any) in the various instrument<br/>
types?  (ie: Lute vs Mandolin)?&quot;  (Still waiting on an answer to that one)<br/>
Also, I looked over the bard site that was mentioned in an earlier letter,<br/>
and I must say I found the site quite informative.  (Especially the<br/>
as-complete-as-currently-possible spellsong list)<br/>
<br/>
Just an opinion,<br/>
