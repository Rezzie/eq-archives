<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540282467">Hello all, I am Jyzan of Karana.  I have been playing a bard since beta,<br/>
and I am the author of the bard guide on EQ Vault, under my beta name<br/>
Jyzanthemum.  (I changed my name for final because nobody liked typing<br/>
Jyzanthemum)  If anyone has any questions, I&#39;d be happy to help if I<br/>
know the answer.<br/>
<br/>
One question I have: does anyone know if the level 18 song, Denon&#39;s<br/>
Disruptive Discord actually works yet?  It did not in beta.<br/>
<br/>
John</div>
