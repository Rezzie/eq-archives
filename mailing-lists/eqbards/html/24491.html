<div id="ygrps-yiv-929122109">Oh okay.......I want to thank everyone for all the help of my questions<br/>
over the last few days...I&#39;m up to level 13 now, and loving it.  Bards are<br/>
so much fun.  I like getting a new song every level, as opposed to other<br/>
casters every 4 (or more).  Always something to look forward to.<br/>
<br/>
So far the funniest thing I&#39;ve done is drag Choon/Froon around WK for a<br/>
long time.  Just don&#39;t let them catch you...ouch..they hit pretty hard.</div>
