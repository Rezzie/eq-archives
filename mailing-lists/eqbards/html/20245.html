<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044160695">I wonder how many people upgraded PC&#39;s due to Kunark.  I had been holding<br/>
out for some time.  Kunark killed my P2-300 Voodoo3 2000 box - so I built an<br/>
Athlon 800 Geforce2 GTS box - and the game is so much cooler!  Gotta love<br/>
it.<br/>

*grin* man oh man what a difference. In Warsliks woods I sometimes lower<br/>
clipping, and I still put particle density on low (in part so I can SEE) but<br/>
detail is always on and 99% of the time clipping is at full. Check out the<br/>
Firiona Vie from the bluff to the left of the bridge (facing the city) .<br/>
It&#39;s just beautiful.<br/>
