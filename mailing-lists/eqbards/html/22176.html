<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949271791">Well, I was slightly bored on Saturday, so I decided to climb the statue of Firiona Vie in FV.  Anything that tall is just meant to be climbed :).  I don&#39;t think it would be possible to anyone not a Bard, but it may be possible.  Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clandlc.com/Firiona/">http://www.clandlc.com/Firiona/</a> for screenshots and a description of how I did it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope a few of you try it yourself, it&#39;s a blast and a great view : )<br/>
