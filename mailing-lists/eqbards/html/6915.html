<div id="ygrps-yiv-765917000">Hey, what about the Claw?  (5/19)  I think it looks<br/>
much cooler than a sword, and I&#39;m thinking of dropping<br/>
my tommy to go with the better looking barbed leather<br/>
whip.  Also, the silvery war axe (in perma) looks<br/>
better than the PGT, and it&#39;s 6/22.  Your right<br/>
though, not a lot of good swords between 20 and 35.<br/>
