<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847516023">You should be able to find wolves in Western Karanas.  Just stay on the east<br/>
side of the zone (it is a huge zone).  Watch out for Grizzlies as they are<br/>
aggressive.<br/>

&gt;Subject: Finding Pelts<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was wondering if any of our loremasters might know where to find Medium<br/>
&gt;and High quality wolf pelts.  Are they available anywhere outside of Qeynos<br/>
&gt;Hills?  Hunting wolves there is very problematic with Holly and that other<br/>
&gt;Ranger guy running about. </span></blockquote></div>
