&gt; If you drop a lore item that is in a container, it will disappear from the<br/>
&gt; container.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you drop a lore item by itself, you will be able to pick it back up<br/>
&gt; again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Motto: Don&#39;t keep really nice lore items in containers because you may drop<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Addendum. If you drop a container with a nodrop item in it the entire<br/>
container will disappear.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend people keep their weapons in regular inventory slots,<br/>
which can be hotkeyed. Then keep your instruments in a bag which can be<br/>
on another hotkeyed inventory slot. This makes swapping a lot easier.<br/>
Only problem might be the Battle Drum. Is it lore? I haven&#39;t played in a<br/>
couple of weeks now so I don&#39;t remember.<br/>
