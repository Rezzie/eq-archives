<div id="ygrps-yiv-427294799">Prior to the last patch, I was succeeding at begging from the<br/>
paladins in N Freeport about half the time (at a skill of 40).  <br/>
Since the last patch, I have yet to succeed at begging (out of<br/>
about 30-40 attempts), and one of the paladins even attacked<br/>
me saying he despised beggars.  I guess Verant was upset I was<br/>
making 14cp every 5 minutes from this skill, and saw fit<br/>
to nerf it. :-)<br/>
