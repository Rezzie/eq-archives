<div id="ygrps-yiv-305153743">When it was first occuring we thought maybe I somehow got on the whole<br/>
fort&#39;s hate list (possibly another group&#39;s mob wandered into my AOE then<br/>
killed them and walked into the fort, tell them about this little punk half<br/>
elf outside)<br/>
<br/>
So I zoned (twice actually, as I had to run right after getting back).  No<br/>
change, as soon as I came up to the group, Giants just starting charging out<br/>
of the fort...<br/>
<br/>
I am not going to sue charm and see if it still happenes tonight.</div>
