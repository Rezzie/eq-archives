<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041422811">Long ago someone posted a GREAT walkthrough of how to get the lutes<br/>
including pulling from the ballroom without trainwreck.  Does anyone<br/>
(including the author) still have it? I would love to get it to some friends<br/>
(44 Mage, 41 Druid) who died miserably there last night trying to get a<br/>
lambent BP as a gift for someone.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
