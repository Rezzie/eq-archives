<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675849168">:)  We are lvl 20, so I don&#39;t have atone yet...<br/>
<br/>
Once I get it, I want to try rooting a mob as the warrior pulls it by<br/>
me, then atoning, and running back and joining the group.  Not sure if<br/>
this will cut into meditation time too much to be useful...<br/>
<br/>
We have the advantage that the puller and the cleric are playing within<br/>
earshot of each other, so he can tell me what to atone without typing<br/>
anything...<br/>

We now return to the non-stop rock.<br/>
