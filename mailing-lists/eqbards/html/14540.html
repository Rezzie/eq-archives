Today I experienced problems with charming. While charming hadden and<br/>
sticking him onto axe I noticed that he won&#39;t follow my orders after<br/>
charm broke and doing the recharm.<br/>
Same happened in everfrost, charming an icy orc and sticking him onto<br/>
Redwind.<br/>
I successfully tried with a snake an rat though. Whats wrong? Does<br/>
anyone know?<br/>
Do blue/white etc. NPC forget our orders now?<br/>
<br/>
puzzled, <br/>
	Tirc.</div>
