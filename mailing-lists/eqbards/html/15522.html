<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510513070">I remember reading a while back (I think), not sure if it was here or<br/>
somewhere else a hint from GZ that we might be getting a new charm type song<br/>
for one of our missing high level song slots.<br/>
Does anyone else remember reading this?  If so, could you repost?  I can&#39;t<br/>
find it anywhere.<br/>
