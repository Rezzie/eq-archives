<div id="ygrps-yiv-113697309">a broken fear is massively boring.  and the only shot of imbrued you have is<br/>
a bracer off a cube, or a flute off CT if he was up.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Did my First Fear Raid last night.  Have to say was one of <br/>
&gt; the most boring<br/>
&gt; nights I&#39;ve ever had in Everquest.  The Plane had been broken <br/>
&gt; early Saturday<br/>
&gt; morning (I believe they said at 9:30 AM CDT) and I got there <br/>
&gt; in anticipation<br/>
&gt; of a respawn at approx 9:30 PM EDT.  I left at about 3:30.<br/>
