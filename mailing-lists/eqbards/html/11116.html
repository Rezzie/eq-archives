&gt;The unicorn in Lesser Faydark is Equestrielle. We killed it once and I got a<br/>
&gt;Unicorn Horn. It&#39;s a wind instrument with 5 charges of Purge. It hits for<br/>
&gt;100+, not sure what level it is though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hrm - according to the screen shots, it&#39;s a wind instrument with a greater <br/>
lightstone effect and nothing more.  Are you sure about the purge <br/>
effect?  Not to be like questionable or nothing....  I&#39;ve been asking for <br/>
help compiling the magical instrument list, and no one seems willing to <br/>
provide any.  *harrumph*<br/>
