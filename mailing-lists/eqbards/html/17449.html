<div id="ygrps-yiv-512249334">i think he meant who are bards to tell a rogue 1hs is worthless to them.<br/>
(and it wasn&#39;t preferential, it was a lotto from what i read.  the bard in<br/>
the group just felt rogues shouldn&#39;t get it) tho i could be wrong<br/>

&gt; &gt; That&#39;s another thing to consider.  If you&#39;re going<br/>
&gt; &gt; to base it<br/>
&gt; &gt; on who will get the best use out of it, are you<br/>
&gt; &gt; basing it on<br/>
&gt; &gt; raw numerical improvement, or percentage<br/>
&gt; &gt; improvement?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I understand the discomfort here...and I am NOT<br/>
&gt; lashing out at anyone, but:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *** who are we to tell someone else how to build their<br/>
&gt; character? ***<br/>

The person asked for reasons why a rogue shouldn&#39;t get<br/>
preferential treatment for an EBW.  I gave a bunch of points<br/>
shooting holes in the &quot;a rogue can use it better than a bard&quot;<br/>
argument. </span></blockquote></div>
