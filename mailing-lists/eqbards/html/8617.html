<b>Subject:</b> Another question about the new armor quests <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347730879">Are the non-jewelery quest components for the bard armor quests new items<br/>
that have been added to the game or have they been around for a while?  I<br/>
have never seen or heard anyone auctioning any of the items before (granted<br/>
I&#39;m not high enough level to go to the places they are found).  <br/>
<br/>
As a 25th level bard, the only way I will be able to gather most of these<br/>
quest components anytime in the near future is to buy them.  I will have to<br/>
gain a few more levels before I can adventure in the places to loot them<br/>
myself.  It also appears that, with the exception of lambent stones, bards<br/>
are the only class that need these items for their armor quests.  If this is<br/>
true, then the market for buying these quest components should be fairly<br/>
small.  The key will be if the quest components are NO DROP.  Does anyone<br/>
know if any of these quest components are NO DROP or can they be sold? <br/>
