<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252792830">I finally got my xalgoz fang (4th attempt).  For turning them into the necro<br/>
frog, most people have told me to use wolf form.  However this would require<br/>
me dragging some friendly druid out of his way...<br/>
<br/>
SO is it possible to use sneak or charm?</div>
