<div id="ygrps-yiv-570477337">I&#39;m not sure whether it was coincidence or not.  There were certainly some<br/>
serious network problems last night - packet loss and ping were through the<br/>
roof at times.  I too was in the Lake of Ill Omen (Bertoxx) and noticed that<br/>
of the 40-ish players there, 18 were linkdead.<br/>

&gt;either it had quite the opposite effect, or by coincidence<br/>
&gt;there were far more connection problems last nite than I<br/>
&gt;have ever seen in 14+ months of play. </span></blockquote></div>
