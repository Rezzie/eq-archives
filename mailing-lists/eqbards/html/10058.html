<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228234922">That last email conversation reminded me of a young Harmonic<br/>
and a &#39;snooty&#39; Shada.  I started laughing, after I thought<br/>
about it some more.  Keep heart young level 22 bard who <br/>
thinks I&#39;m on a high horse.  I was right where you were <br/>
not so long ago.  =)<br/>
<br/>
( And now I have utmost respect for Shada, go figure ;p )<br/>

Harmonic, only STR 109, high horser, god?</div>
