&gt;      Does that mean that the big tower in the middle of Lake Rath with the<br/>
&gt;      blue flame is going to be the gate to the plane of air perhaps?<br/>

being a plane gate is Feerrott, and if shad is right the oasis island.<br/>
I am very interested in seeing what these other 2 planes are going to be <br/>
like.<br/>
