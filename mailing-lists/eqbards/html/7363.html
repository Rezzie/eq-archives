&gt;Ok....as far as i know<br/>
&gt;1.the Slime Crystal Staff does Drop off of King Xorbb in the gorge.<br/>
&gt;2.The Water Crystal Staff drops off of Webclaw Murkwave in Lake Rathe...I<br/>
&gt;believe he is a froglock.  he is definitely a caster, and he is in the water. <br/>
&gt;if you try to pull him out of the water, he 32K&#39;s himself.  So, you have to<br/>
&gt;fight him underwater.  He will just sit there and bomb until one of you is<br/>
&gt;dead.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not correct - he is an aqua goblin who regularly comes out of the water.  I<br/>
was hunting aviaks when a nearby farmer kept killing him every 30 minutes<br/>
or so (immediately followed by &quot;For Sale: Water Crystal Staff, 30pp&quot;)</div>
