<div id="ygrps-yiv-398463540">The ones I use most during fighting is <br/>
/pet back off<br/>
/pet attack<br/>
/pet follow (if I&#39;m having to pull)  Did this alot in Cazic, because of the<br/>
horrible pathing, it was about the only way to get the lizzies to follow me<br/>
up the temple.<br/>
<br/>
And then just to amuse myself<br/>
/pet sit down (or is it just sit?)<br/>
<br/>

&gt; This isn&#39;t strictly a bard question, but it&#39;s not irrelevant either, so...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What pet commands do you folks find yourselves using most often?  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; trying<br/>
&gt; to arrange hot keys for one of my alts & I&#39;m trying to use as few of them<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; possible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks<br/>
