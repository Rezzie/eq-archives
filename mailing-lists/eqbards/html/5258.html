<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430625044">Heh, I&#39;m surprised that everyone else didn&#39;t jump on<br/>
this, but being friday, I suppose your all out<br/>
scheming your way out of work early to go play EQ....<br/>
<br/>
Bard have the 2hd slash and blunt skill listed, but<br/>
cannot raise it past one (1).  The reason being in<br/>
beta there was a debate on wheater to give us two<br/>
handed weapons or dual wield to raise our melee<br/>
ability.  As I&#39;m sure you know, we have dual wield. <br/>
However, the 2hd skills where never removed from our<br/>
guild.  <br/>
