<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275293916">True.  I&#39;m aware of that feature and in fact was using it last night to PS<br/>
two (sometimes three *gulp*) frogs at a time.  Resists make it dangerous<br/>
enough to be fun.  *shrug*  I just assumed the SK would root the damn frog,<br/>
y&#39;know?  If he&#39;d said OOM I would have done something different.  Lack of<br/>
communication kills, no two ways about it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyways, here&#39;s a tip with Pixie Strike.  Once you target a<br/>
&gt; mob and start a targeted song, you don&#39;t have to keep it<br/>
&gt; targeted.  You can switch to a different target, attack,<br/>
&gt; etc. and the Pixie Strike will still hit the mob you had<br/>
&gt; targeted when you started the song.<br/>
