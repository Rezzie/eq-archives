<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080306224">A L20 shaman was in my group tonight so I had a chance to<br/>
compare SoW vs. Selo&#39;s.  I picked two trees and ran between<br/>
them four times under different effects, measuring the time<br/>
with a stopwatch:<br/>
<br/>
No speed enhancement :  12.1 12.1 12.1 12.1<br/>
SoW : 8.7 8.7 8.7 8.7<br/>
Selo&#39;s, no drum : 8.7 8.9 8.9 8.8<br/>
Selo&#39;s, with drum : 7.4 7.4 7.4 7.4<br/>
<br/>
So a L20 SoW is barely faster than a L21 Selo&#39;s without a<br/>
drum, but Selo&#39;s blows it away with a drum.  Selo&#39;s is also<br/>
getting close to twice the speed of just plain walking.<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to time Selo&#39;s with a drum while running backwards.<br/>
:-)  From the times I&#39;ve done it to druids and shamen, I&#39;d say<br/>
Selo&#39;s running backwards with a drum is pretty close to Selo&#39;s<br/>
running forward without a drum.  SoW is faster, but barely.<br/>
