<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313331586">I mean you go through life hyper-paranoid and ya, you maybe get screwed<br/>
less, but I haven&#39;t found it&#39;s worth it. There are a lot of ways that that<br/>
sort of act is it&#39;s own punishment, the person who did it is stuck knowing<br/>
they are a person who does that sort of thing, and I most certainly don&#39;t<br/>
envy him/her that. However, I really like the reporting thing too :o) Good<br/>
luck!<br/>
