<div id="ygrps-yiv-901881614">Has anyone else noticed that since the last patch that click-targetting has<br/>
gotten a lot better?  I can now MUCH more easy target a player or mob that is<br/>
partially obstructed by another player or mob.  I used to have to just run<br/>
around the mob in front to target the one behind.  If you haven&#39;t noticed yet,<br/>
try targetting different people that are close together like at a city or<br/>
outside a zone healing/medding.  For ME anyhow, it&#39;s working much better.<br/>
