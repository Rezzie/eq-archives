<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060605145">Unless I&#39;m mistaken, Ykesha won&#39;t proc at all until level 38, so maybe proc<br/>
frequency has to do with level as well as dex. Dunno. Ain&#39;t gone one. Sure<br/>
ain&#39;t level 38 :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If and when the Ykesha procs and is dependent upon your DEX. What<br/>
&gt; does your DEX need to be for it to proc well?  Mine is 135 right now.<br/>
