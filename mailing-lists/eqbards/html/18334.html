<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-328664575">/ooc A rapidly spreading virus is sweeping across the world at an alarming rate.<br/>
It has the subject &quot;I LOVE YOU&quot; and contains an attachment &quot;A Love Letter For You&quot;.  This attachment contains a Visual Basic virus which will do the following:<br/>
<br/>
Re-direct you IE homepage to www.skyinet.com<br/>
Overwrite your .jpg, .css, .vbs, .mpg, .mp3 (amongst others) files and give them a .vbs extension. It is suspected that the virus will append itself to these files also.<br/>
Propogate to all your contacts in your Outlook contacts list.<br/>
<br/>
Several UK and European companies have been brought down by this virus, which is spreading faster than the Melissa virus of last year.  It also hit our company a short while ago.<br/>
<br/>
Delete any mail with the subject &quot;I LOVE YOU&quot; and certainly do not open any attachments it may contain.<br/>
<br/>
Symantec have very recently released an update to their software to combat the virus, although their homepage is currently swamped ;)<br/>
<br/>
I know people don&#39;t usually trust anti-virus mails, but this is not a drill ;)  Check out the news pages of www.yahoo.co.uk or www.zdnet.com for details.<br/>
