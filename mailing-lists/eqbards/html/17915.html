<br/>
I started collecting a few bronze pieces but yeah, it was largely too heavy,<br/>
so I ended up going back to mix and matched various resist/dex/agi pieces as<br/>
I saw them for sale. Now I am headed back to the pursuit of AC, I currently<br/>
have bronze Chest and boots, but only while waiting on Lambent.<br/>

here, I am happy to give wildly inaccurate answers to anything, and have<br/>
never had a problem getting my inane questions answered)</div>
