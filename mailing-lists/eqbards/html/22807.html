<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525436475">Yup :) Same as giants in that respect.  Also with that you can quest for your Colbalt Scar key if you want instead of killing the dragon for it.<br/>
<br/>
I have also heard that the Wakening Lands dragon -Wuoshi *spelling- is on CoV faction.  So I guess if you feel the need you can raise your faction there.<br/>
