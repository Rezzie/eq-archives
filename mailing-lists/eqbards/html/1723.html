<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357943525">Actually Taliesin did sneak into I forgot the sorceress&#39;s name&#39;s hut to<br/>
drink her potion that gave him the wisdome to become the greatest of the<br/>
bards ergo picking locks is something very much they would stoop to.  infact<br/>
almost every of the wise ones was known for being a bit of a rogue..<br/>
Amergin was discribed in atleast one tale of wearing the war colors of his<br/>
clan which was chain.. and though he did not fight directly his song<br/>
inspired the battle.  He was also trained as was every celtic boy and many<br/>
of the women in combat.. and being the son of a chieftain would have had<br/>
armor.. the histories really are rather dynamic.<br/>

&gt; For those detractors wondering where my image of a Bard came from, it is a<br/>
&gt; mix of fantasy and historical literature including Ambergin and Taliesin.<br/>
&gt; Also Verant&#39;s own image seems to bely wearing plate armor, we do after all<br/>
&gt; get the skills of pick locks, something no celtic bard would ever stoop<br/>
to,<br/>
&gt; and sneak, try picturing that in Plate armor.<br/>
