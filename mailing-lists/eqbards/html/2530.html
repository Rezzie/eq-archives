&gt;What is &quot;proc?&quot;  Where does the word come from?  Words from inside the<br/>
&gt;software and its design, like &quot;mob&quot; have a way of slipping into the game.<br/>
&gt;Bet you haven&#39;t guessed that bothers me.  :-)}<br/>

special procedure.  The yaulp from the screaming mace, the bloodclaw effect<br/>
from the bc stilleto, the berserk effect from the polished granite tomahawk.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>   To a degree, I&#39;ll agree that using some of these terms in system warnings<br/>
is probably bad taste.  It&#39;s easy to forget which terms are localized to a<br/>
game or genre.  Imagine me trying to explain to my parents camping for a<br/>
tommy :)<br/>
