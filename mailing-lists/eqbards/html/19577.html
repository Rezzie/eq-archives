<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149625520">I&#39;ve only been in Burning Woods once.  I was in a group that consisted of a<br/>
ranger, cleric, and two other bards.  I was the lowest level (37th) of<br/>
anyone in the group.  On everything we fought, the ranger snared and the<br/>
highest level bard kept fear song up the entire fight.  We fought gorillas,<br/>
hornets, and wurms.  The only person in the group who took consistent damage<br/>
was the ranger.  The three bards hardly ever got touched.  Was your group<br/>
using snare/fear or were you fighting with conventional tactics?  BTW we<br/>
were able to kill Gullerback (named gorilla with a helluva lot of HPs) using<br/>
this technique.  Took us forever and the cleric had to heal the ranger<br/>
several times but we were never in serious trouble.  <br/>

My Bard is a bit low level and as such has never  been<br/>
to Burning Woods - but both my wizard and Ranger visit<br/>
there quite often.<br/>
<br/>
When any of us group with our bards ( 40plus ) in<br/>
burning woods we have an EXTREMELY hard time keeping<br/>
the mobs off him/her. Its like a flag pops up that<br/>
says Bard in the zone - get him/her.</div>
