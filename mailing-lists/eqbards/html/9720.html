That said, I&#39;ve had several instances, all in Permafrost and<br/>
Lower Guk (live side), where stuff that I&#39;d /conned as<br/>
indifferent just moments before attacked me.  I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
my invisibility didn&#39;t drop, but they all ended up in trains<br/>
or fights so ugly the first attack scrolled off my buffer.<br/>
