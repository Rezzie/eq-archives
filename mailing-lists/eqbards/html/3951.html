<div id="ygrps-yiv-355882797">The extra Normal HP regen point happens at 20th level. I was Pleasantly<br/>
suprised by it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;At some level your normal regeneration rate gets upgraded to 3<br/>
&gt;pts/tick (not quite sure when or if this is sitting), which<br/>
&gt;would put it at 19 pts/tick at L42. Sitting gives you an extra<br/>
&gt;1 pt/tick, for 20 pts/tick. </span></blockquote></div>
