<div id="ygrps-yiv-173018453">Hello fellow bards !<br/>
<br/>
I have been perusing this site for a while amongst others and have<br/>
noticed no references to specialty items available only to bards, other<br/>
than their instruments of course.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if bards get their own special equipment?  If so, I<br/>
would be interested in hearing about it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
