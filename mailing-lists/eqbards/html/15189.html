&gt; Speaking of Off-Topic, I&#39;ve been thinking of compiling little &quot;bits&quot; like<br/>
&gt; that.  Hidden &quot;cute&quot; things, almost Easter eggs, but not quite...<br/>
&gt; Things like, have you ever translated the side of the Qeynos<br/>
&gt; clocktower?*  Or notice the fisherman named &quot;Bait Masterson&quot;?<br/>
&gt; Other little things like that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or have you ever spelled Qeynos backwards? I was playing 6 months before I<br/>
got that one. Yep, sometimes I&#39;m a stupid bard.<br/>
