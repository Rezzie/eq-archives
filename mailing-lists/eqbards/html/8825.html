<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910580544">I&#39;m not certain, but I think that corpses only go *poof* when the mob dies and the thing you&#39;ve<br/>
been charming to kill it is not currently charmed.  They check to see who did the most damage,<br/>
and since the thing that did the most is an unaligned NPC, *poof*.<br/>
