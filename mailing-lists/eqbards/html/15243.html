<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146997446">I was kind of wondering why people downplayed Warsong, but wasn;t going<br/>
to say anything.  I use it all the time, but then again I solo a lot<br/>
still (I have a good but small guild, so when they aren&#39;t around, I<br/>
usually solo, as pickup groups usually means lose xp for me).<br/>
<br/>
BTW I hit (drumroll please...) lvl 20 this weekend!  I was pretty damn<br/>
excited.  Still working on that surname.<br/>

Elfson Allegro is my favorite so far...<br/>
