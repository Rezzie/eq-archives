<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294544283">There are many times, I simply hate to abandon my instrument and <br/>
equip my heavy weapon. I would love to continue pounding my drum and <br/>
punch my enemy in synchrony with the beat of my tune. However so far, <br/>
my delicate hands yield very little damage, unless holding a weapon. <br/>
I was wondering if any fellow bard has an excellent hand to hand <br/>
skill. Is it worth practicing? What is the most damage that can be <br/>
inflicted with ones bare bard hands?<br/>
