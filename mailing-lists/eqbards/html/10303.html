<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964801676">I just got level 25 last night and memmed Psalm of<br/>
Warmth.  I like the damage shield alot.  Anyway, I<br/>
haven&#39;t heard much discussion about this song other<br/>
than the damage it does.  I was wondering what<br/>
people&#39;s opinions of it are.  I&#39;m thinking it would be<br/>
great in a group and pretty awesome solo.  Yet i never<br/>
hear anyone talking about twisting it in.  If you do<br/>
twist it in, what do you end up twisting it with?<br/>
