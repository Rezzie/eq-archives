<div id="ygrps-yiv-91251508">Also from the EQ boards, regarding the &quot;Project M&quot; - players-as-monsters thing:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I thought I&#39;d pop in and explain to you all why you can&#39;t play as monsters <br/>
at the moment.<br/>
When the patch went long today (I&#39;m very sorry about that) the servers came <br/>
back up pretty much at prime time. We decided that it might not be the best <br/>
thing in the world to turn on project M right after a patch and to coincide <br/>
with prime time. We thought that all of those factors combined might be a <br/>
little more than the PvP servers or their players could handle.<br/>
We&#39;ll turn it on some time soon. And I&#39;m probably not going to announce it┬à<br/>
