<div id="ygrps-yiv-942179196"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll let Jyzan or Mr. Kim or someone point you in the right direction as I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have any of the more descriptive lists linked from work (Jyzan, didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; you update the eqvault list to be more detailed or something?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has been updated, yes, up to level 20.  There are some errors in it<br/>
still (it says that Hymn and Chords only work on the pulse, when this<br/>
isn&#39;t the case anymore) and some areas of debate (some people say<br/>
Warsong and Anthem stack and others don&#39;t) and I think there&#39;s even a<br/>
blatent instrument error (I think I said that the lament was a singing<br/>
skill song), but overall, it&#39;s pretty thorough.  The one that&#39;s floating<br/>
around this list as a .doc is quite good too.<br/>
