<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618009615">The problem seems to be gone folks.  I had a very enjoyable<br/>
time tonight, only missed the &quot;easy&quot; songs maybe 2%-5%.  I<br/>
still missed the higher level songs more frequently, but<br/>
that&#39;s to be expected.  I&#39;m still seeing more missed notes<br/>
than before Verant broke it, but it&#39;s a once-a-minute-in-<br/>
combat thing, not once-every-three-songs.<br/>
