<div id="ygrps-yiv-696412690">I can easily twist 3 even with spell effects on, and can <br/>
just about do 3 1/3 ....<br/>
<br/>
Keeping 4 icons steadily up is not possible for me.<br/>
<br/>
That was with a 33.3 modem, 224 RAM (don&#39;t ask), 350 P II<br/>
and a Viper 770 Ultra.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a closer match .. except for the RAM ... so hopefully I&#39;m a <br/>
good data point.  I have however done registry and system.ini tweaks<br/>
for gaming performance, and found the DX 7.0a upgrade a must and have<br/>
recently grabbed the 7.0 DX compatible drivers.  That all helped as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the modem was replaced by cable yesterday (and I&#39;ve been out or<br/>
EQ down ever since) :P  I&#39;ll have to see if that nudges me up to 4<br/>
or if 3 1/2 is still my best.  I&#39;ll also want to flip off spell-effects<br/>
on that test run.<br/>
<br/>
I still HATE twisting though ... makes my fingers hurt!<br/>
