<div id="ygrps-yiv-355509845">You start one song, then as soon as you see the text message (&quot;your<br/>
wounds begin to heal&quot;) you stop singing and start the second.<br/>
<br/>
FYI since reading about the hotkeys here one the list i can now TWIST<br/>
(my vote) 3 songs successfully 95% of the time, only bashes and stunns<br/>
throw me off. Makes my soloing 100% easier! can kill most blue mobs<br/>
(dervs at the present) with 75% HP left.<br/>

Ok, this may sound silly, but I&#39;ve actually had people ask this, and<br/>
wonder<br/>
about the &quot;REAL&quot; definition of juggling/twisting/mixing/stacking....<br/>
<br/>
When you juggle, you start the first song. Ok easy, so far.<br/>
WHEN do you start the second?<br/>
Do you start the second immediately when the icon for that song comes<br/>
up? Do<br/>
you start it immediately when you see the expected text in the textbox?<br/>
(If<br/>
it sounds stupid, I&#39;ve actually seen so many times where the icon does<br/>
NOT<br/>
go up at the same time as the words appear in the text box). Or do you<br/>
click<br/>
a song, don&#39;t wait for anything and click the next song right away? Do<br/>
you<br/>
start the first song, and wait to start the second until the graphics<br/>
for<br/>
the first song take effect? (i.e. the little blue sprinkles for Hymn,<br/>
etc.)</div>
