<b>Subject:</b> L 11 song and L21+ sites? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685763670">I&#39;ve checked a couple of decent sources, and they disagree on what the lvl<br/>
11 song is.  I think EQVault says it&#39;s one thing, but it&#39;s broken.<br/>
<br/>
Could someone set me straight, please (and if you know where to find it,<br/>
that&#39;d be great, too :) )?<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, even though it&#39;ll probably be months before I get to lvl 21 (I<br/>
enjoy my cleric and mage too, but bard most of all), where can I find the<br/>
higher level songs?  Are there any high level bard web sites?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
