&gt; &gt;Unless you get gate too, how would binding outside perma <br/>
&gt; &gt;help you get back from an evac?<br/>

&gt; You&#39;re right. &lt;chuckle&gt;  Disregard that post, it was unfounded.<br/>

Norrath is very poorly service by gate points, so an expedition and evac<br/>
return is definately more painful than anywhere else. <br/>
