<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596163407">My best luck was with Anthem and the Bellow.  Depending on my timing, I<br/>
could sometimes get the Bellow to go off twice before losing Anthem - but I<br/>
could always get it once, then switch back to Anthem.  The increased speed<br/>
DOES mean a lot, btw - much more than the increased str.  And the extra 7<br/>
adds up (although I counted and averaged, and not including resists,<br/>
against blues, I was averaging 4-5 for a total of about 40 extra damage any<br/>
combat).<br/>
