&gt; Lol, who cares, either way he didn&#39;t really earn 60.  He <br/>
&gt; &quot;cheated&quot; to get<br/>
&gt; it.  Not cheated as in broke any rules but definitely cheated <br/>
&gt; the system to<br/>
&gt; get ahead of it.  I refuse to congratulate, hold in awe, or <br/>
&gt; respect someone<br/>
&gt; that finds pleasure in cheating the system.<br/>

created characters called Banker and Teller a while back?   If that was you<br/>
than consider this an official ribbing, a busing of your @$$, a pi$$ take,<br/>
and an attempt at levity.  (Anything but a flame.)<br/>

&gt; fast they can hit 60 ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh.  I dinged 11 last night.  For giggles I hit /played and found out my<br/>
bard&#39;s birthday was May 5th.  That&#39;s almost a level a month!  Woohoo!   And<br/>
it only took me 6 days of playing time to do it.  I think I deserve a<br/>
cookie.<br/>
