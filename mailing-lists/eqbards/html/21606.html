<div id="ygrps-yiv-53690758"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The macro lays the Chant, Charms the mob, and<br/>
sits the pet.  When the pet gets back up I know to reapply the hotkey.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting.  While the mob is charmed, does Chant still damage it?<br/>
<br/>
I had thought of trying this, but dismissed it, thinking that after<br/>
charming, subsequent pulses of Chant wouldn&#39;t have any effect.</div>
