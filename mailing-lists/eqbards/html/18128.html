<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989600538">So I get fed up with EQ this weekend and decide to head out to actually<br/>
spend time with my wife by doing the old dinner and a movie routine.  We<br/>
decide to see U-541 (or whatever it&#39;s called).  The lights go down and I<br/>
am wrapping up a quiet conversation before the previews begin when my<br/>
wife suddenly starts hissing and throwing popcorn at the screen.  I turn<br/>
to find the overly familier gold font of &quot;EVERQUEST&quot; smack dab in the<br/>
middle of the screen in 5 foot high letters.  This game is stalking me.<br/>
<br/>
Movie was ok, btw.  No real treat.<br/>
