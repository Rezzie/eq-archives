<br/>
  Harm.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Lately I&#39;ve been feeling low<br/>
   A remedy is what I&#39;m seeking<br/>
   Take a taste of what&#39;s below<br/>
   Come away to something better<br/>
   What I want is what I&#39;ve not got<br/>
   But what I need is all around me<br/>
   Reaching, searching, never stop...&quot;</div>
