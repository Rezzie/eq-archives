<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332718280">Cantana isn&#39;t even a word!  Doesn&#39;t show up in the Merriam-Webster <br/>
dictionary.  But hey, it&#39;s their world.  They can make up words, <br/>
can&#39;t they?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Does anyone know or has anyone heard if they are going to fix <br/>
&gt; &gt; the name of<br/>
&gt; &gt; this song?  I&#39;ve been bugging it since I received it.  I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; &gt; sure they meant<br/>
&gt; &gt; it to be Cantata of Soothing, but someone misspelled it as <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Cantana&quot;.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; a minor point to be sure, but an annoying one nonetheless.<br/>
