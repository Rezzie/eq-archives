<div id="ygrps-yiv-438302219">Has ANYONE seen this drop. I don&#39;t want to hear stories. I<br/>
want to know if someone has actually seen, and clicked it to<br/>
pick up.<br/>
<br/>
I was camping The Kly this weekend, and saw NOTHING but a<br/>
silly helm. Lore no less.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard rumors from it being removed, being made the<br/>
rare drop, to being moved to The Hole. Can anyone<br/>
substantiate where this item is anymore?</div>
