<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361486891">wow grats, VERY lucky is right.  that cloak is seriously rare.  if you get<br/>
imbrued your dex is gonna be scary.  as far as the sash, get used to<br/>
moonstone rings.<br/>

&gt;   I should really force myself to try to get a sash.<br/>
&gt;   I got lucky with a cloak of shadows the other day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s just hard convincing other players that a bard would<br/>
&gt;   want a sash or a Yk.  Guess I&#39;ll try and drag the guild<br/>
&gt;   down one night.<br/>

&gt;   Harmonic, 155 dex now and no plane armor =) </span></blockquote></div>
