<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127608077"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Now wait a minute.  How in the world is a discussion of <br/>
&gt; which weapons are good for bards off topic???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It wasn&#39;t the &quot;which weapons are good for Bards&quot; topic I was wishing to<br/>
avoid, but instead a thread where people debate which weapons are worth what<br/>
prices as that&#39;s not so much Bard related and there&#39;s no easy answer since<br/>
some people value things more than other people will. Thus I was more trying<br/>
to avoid any arguments. If that discussion isn&#39;t off topic, then ignore me.<br/>
