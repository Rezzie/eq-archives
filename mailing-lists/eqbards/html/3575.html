     <br/>
         I was wondering if there is any consensus on whether there is any <br/>
     damage absorbion effect from different types of armor over and above <br/>
     the change in AC?<br/>
     <br/>
     When I upgraded to Banded I seemed to notice that not only was I <br/>
     getting hit less often but also for less damage.  So I am wondering if <br/>
     bronze plate might have the same advantage.  Bronze is only slightly <br/>
     better then banded ac wise (1 or 2 ac better depending on the piece) <br/>
     but weights almost twice as much.  Not a very good trade off <br/>
     considering the weight problem that most of us have.  <br/>
     <br/>
     So, in a nutshell, is Bronze plate worth the extra weight?  Does plate <br/>
     have an advantage over banded other then the AC increase?<br/>
     <br/>
     Thanks for you help!<br/>
