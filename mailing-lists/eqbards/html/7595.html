So many people keep saying this but list no reasons on why druid&#39;s and<br/>
shaman&#39;s are hyrbids.<br/>
<br/>
Here is why I think why..<br/>
<br/>
They can were armor.  An item a pure caster cannot wear.  That in itself<br/>
makes them a hybrid.  Heres a simplistic example:<br/>
<br/>
Black = Caster<br/>
White = Melee<br/>
Grey  = Hybrid<br/>
<br/>
A hybrid shares some of each types characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
Wizard cant wear Plate but can cast spells = Black<br/>
Melee Can wear Plate but cant cast spells  = White<br/>
Hybrid can wear plate or equivalent and can cast some spells = Grey<br/>
<br/>
Classes = Grey<br/>
	    Ranger<br/>
	    Shaman<br/>
	    Cleric<br/>
	    Druid<br/>
	    Bard<br/>
	    Paladin<br/>
	    ShadowKnight<br/>
<br/>
How can this logic be refuted when looked at in this light?</div>
