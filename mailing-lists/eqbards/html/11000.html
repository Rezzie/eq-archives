<div id="ygrps-yiv-909146558">I&#39;ve been having stamina problems duel wielding an obsidian scimitar and a<br/>
dragoon dirk in long battles.  I&#39;m currently trying to figure out what to<br/>
replace the scimitar with, but I&#39;m not all that sure of the trade value of<br/>
it.  I&#39;ve got an offer on the table of a Silvery War Axe for the Obsidian<br/>
Scimitar.  Is this a good trade?</div>
