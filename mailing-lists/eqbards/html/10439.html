&gt; noticed that although DDD may be more powerful, CoD will be resisited by<br/>
higher<br/>
&gt; level creatures MUCH less often.  About the only things that resisted it<br/>
were red &#92;<br/>
&gt; cons that were upper 30&#39;s-ish to maybe 40.  Don&#39;t take my word for it, try<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; yourself and see ;o)<br/>

Yeah - I&#39;ve noticed that too - I figure its because I&#39;ve only known DDD for<br/>
4 levels and CoD for many more --- When I get resisted, I just keep<br/>
weaving - eventually, I slip a few in and they are damaged...<br/>
