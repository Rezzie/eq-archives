<div id="ygrps-yiv-977043472">My own cynical idea is this:  with Bards really wanting scales, Vox is being raided a lot more than she<br/>
used to be.  And the more often people raid her, the better they get.  And with Velious items coming into<br/>
the world, she IS getting easier.  So she appears to be too easy now.  So they&#39;re making the encounter<br/>
harder.  Without changing the level cap.  Would that surprise anyone?<br/>

&gt; Dungeon Touchups/Revamps: We have plans for some updates and/or revamps for<br/>
&gt; some of the dungeons in the world. Our last patch included an updated<br/>
&gt; Runnyeye complete with new monsters and treasures to be plundered. Next on<br/>
&gt; the list is Permafrost Keep. Lady Vox has been in the mood to do some<br/>
&gt; redecorating of her lair, which includes replacing some of her more<br/>
&gt; lackwitted minions. Stay tuned for more specific information as it is<br/>

&gt; Would be nice if they made it hard enough to be properly tuned to remove the<br/>
&gt; level cap; yet in range with the capabilities of the majority of players&#39;<br/>
&gt; guilds/alliances to take on.  (Some may argue with me - but Gorenaire IMHO<br/>
&gt; is too difficult for the majority of the players to have ANY chance to go<br/>
&gt; after)<br/>
