<b>Subject:</b> Has the Lugubrious Lament Been Nerfed?? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838027991">In the last week or so I have seen a REALLY troubling trend with our level 8<br/>
song, the Lugubrious Lament, lovingly known simply as &quot;The Lull Song&quot; by most<br/>
of us.<br/>
<br/>
Simply put, this song has been basically USELESS for me lately!<br/>
<br/>
I have been living in the Ocean of Tears pretty much exclusively since level 20<br/>
(I am almost 27 now), and the things that I used to be able to lull with ease<br/>
now ignore me over half the time!<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t just a bad run... this has been consistent for about 4 or 5 days<br/>
now.  I used to be able to lull the whole Pirate of Gunthak camp and waltz in<br/>
and pull the Captain.  Now, I ALWAYS get at least one other pirate on me at the<br/>
same time.  Fighting Isle Goblins this morning, I was only able to lull one out<br/>
of 4 goblins... when before, I would lull everyone with ease.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else noticed this?  Or am I just experiencing some really wacked out<br/>
statistically bad luck?<br/>
