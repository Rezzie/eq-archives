<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Any AE damage spell will harm the caster if casted too<br/>
&gt; close. The worst offender I know of is a warrior<br/>
&gt; sword. Bladestorm: Katana of Steel Sleet. When it<br/>
&gt; procs (it does now, they fixed it) you take ~850dmg<br/>
&gt; from the AE spell. You can&#39;t avoid the proc, it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; sword...<br/>
