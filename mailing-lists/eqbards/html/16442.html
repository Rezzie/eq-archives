  wear off.  I see you fall into the lazy druid category now.<br/>
<br/>
  Snare when the mob is at 1/3 of it&#39;s life, you&#39;ll have best results.<br/>
  If you are the primary healer, your snare job doesn&#39;t change.<br/>
  You heal, and then you snare.  There are places where snaring is<br/>
  critical, Permafrost and SolA come to mind.  If you got resisted<br/>
  on Snare, then chances are the monster will not be running from<br/>
  you as it&#39;s 6ish levels higher than you are.  Fight non-red mobs,<br/>
  or find a party who is closer to your level.  Snare works perfectly<br/>
  then.  I think it&#39;s not so much that the spell is busted, but rather<br/>
  the player.  Gotta hate user error.<br/>
