<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-374992944">I was just looking around and noticing that there are certain effects on <br/>
Bard armour that... well.. confuse me.<br/>
<br/>
Resonant / Melodic breastplates both bear the effect Selo&#39;s Song of <br/>
Travel.  How does this work?  Does it stay &quot;clicked&quot; until you zone or does <br/>
it last a certain amount of time?  I&#39;d really hate to have to start <br/>
twisting armour ;)<br/>
