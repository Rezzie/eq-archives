<div id="ygrps-yiv-97868837">I just checked the Verant official message board, and yes, the text <br/>
dissapearance bug only seems to affect bards and people in their group.<br/>
<br/>
Mabye it&#39;s just that we fill up our text window buffer with song spam faster <br/>
than most people do, but Esther is aware of the problem and is actually <br/>
testing it (wow, scary huh?)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we should mention that it only happens while playing lullaby against <br/>
way green mobs... lol<br/>
