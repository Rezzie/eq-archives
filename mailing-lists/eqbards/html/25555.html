&quot;When I was young, we had to wait DAYS for the patch!  During prime <br/>
time!  In the rain (which you couldn&#39;t see through because the clip-plane <br/>
was broken!)  Uphill.  Both ways.  With no SoW!  And for what?  Sure we had <br/>
zones - two of &#39;em. In black and white.  And only one mob.  The mangy <br/>
rat.  People camped that rat for hours, and every kill-stole from everyone <br/>
else.  Not that it mattered. The rat only had 1 copper for loot.  And since <br/>
everything cost at least a platinum, nobody could afford any good <br/>
equipment.  Not that there was any good equipment - just a rusty sword and <br/>
a moss-covered twig....&quot;<br/>
