<div id="ygrps-yiv-710579882">I got him by accident 2 weeks ago.  Gotta love tracking ;p  Just happened to<br/>
be in S Ro, took a quick look and wow!  Gave the ring to my cleric friend<br/>
who was along.  Have to get 2 more rings.  One for my wizard to make him<br/>
some booties and another for him to wear for the stats, heh.  Warrior friend<br/>
spent 4 days there over 2 weekends. Got KS&#39;d 3 times before she got her<br/>
ring.  I have this irresitable urge to turn in 325pp too. Heh.<br/>
