<b>Subject:</b> Black pearl rumor (off topic) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-952546028">Someone told me last night that he had heard a rumor of a mob somewhere that<br/>
always dropped a black pearl as its loot.  He didn&#39;t know anymore details<br/>
but told me that the person who told him was a reliable source.  He and I<br/>
have grouped since we were level 5 so I know he would have told me more info<br/>
had he known it.  <br/>
<br/>
Is this just another EQ rumor or is it possibly true?  I have only looted a<br/>
black pearl once.  I got it off a barbed bone skeleton in Unrest. I and<br/>
everyone else in my group was quite surprised when I got it.  Everyone was<br/>
under the impression that barbed bones never dropped anything except cash.<br/>
I have also heard that avocets will sometimes drop a black pearl.  I have<br/>
gotten some type of jewel every time I have looted an avocet so I am<br/>
inclined to believe they will drop a black pearl as a rare drop.<br/>
<br/>
If you can confirm this rumor but don&#39;t want to give out the secret, a<br/>
simple confirmation will suffice.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
