The AGI penalty is removed as soon as the HP shield is. In fact the<br/>
message you get to tell you your shield is gone is &quot;you fell your<br/>
agility return&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY problem with the PGT is that IF a mob hits you (and they will<br/>
since you have such poor agility) for more than the shield, the damage<br/>
comes thru. So if you are fighting any mob that can hit for more than<br/>
the ammount of the shield, they get one free hit, and then your agility<br/>
returns to normal<br/>
