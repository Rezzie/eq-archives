<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012422891"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>well i didn&#39;t have a level 50-60, but i did have a level 44 druid<br/>
and 3 or 4 other characters around level 10-15.  you probly shouldn&#39;t assume<br/>
that i am not in the same situation.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fair point.<br/>
<br/>
