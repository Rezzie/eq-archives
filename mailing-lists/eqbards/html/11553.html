<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671282912">Yesterday I read on the EQ newsgroup about a rumor that the assasin didn&#39;t<br/>
drop the Guise anymore.  There were several replies from people stating it<br/>
was a false rumor and that they had personally looted a Guise that very day.<br/>
Is this what your question was referrring to?  <br/>
