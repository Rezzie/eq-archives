&gt; &gt; I can&#39;t see how this can be true. But, tonight I&#39;ll check it out by<br/>
&gt; &gt; measuring thetime it takes to run X distance (using loc).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; running through Everfrost makes it plain, fast/not so fast/fast/not so fast<br/>
&gt; as you run across dirt/snow patches. anyway I will be curious what the exact<br/>
&gt; ratio is.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like texture differences to me. Run through a flat plain, slow. Run<br/>
by a building fast. Run down a narrow pass, fast. Run out into a valley,<br/>
slow. Run in a dirt patch with clearly defined, measurable edges, fast.<br/>
Run in the snow with fewer reliable units of measurement, slow.<br/>
<br/>
But as I said, I&#39;ll just have to try and see for myself. =)<br/>
