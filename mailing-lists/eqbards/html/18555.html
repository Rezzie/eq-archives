<div id="ygrps-yiv-23613395">At your level you might like to try Warsilik Woods and The Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in the Swamp of No Hope at the moment and soloing quite happily.  It&#39;s<br/>
very quiet there.  I&#39;m on the outskirts of the Froglok village, picking off<br/>
frogs that step on MY side of the river... they never learn. ;)  There<br/>
aren&#39;t too many things that con red to me at 22 there, so I&#39;d give it a miss<br/>
unless you want to check out the ruins and the Froglok village.</div>
