<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489046692"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Somehow we lost the &quot;effectiveness against any monster&quot; part <br/>
&gt;and it became bard vs. cleric.  I dunno how it became a melee-only <br/>
&gt;contest too, maybe because I was comparing defensive melee skills <br/>
&gt;and someone dropped the &quot;defensive&quot; part.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lol.  blame it on the god of hate.  because we all really<br/>
must hate each to keep wanting to kill everyone.  Make a<br/>
friend, slay a gnoll.<br/>

up with, &#39;You beat me.  You am strong little thing.&#39;<br/>
