 </span></blockquote>  Only on dragon raids and plane trips, you&#39;ll notice.  I cannot stress<br/>
  waiting on dragon raids.  Cause there ain&#39;t nothing else left after you<br/>
  do them.  Make the level, and then kick back on dragons.  Otherwise,<br/>
  you aren&#39;t gonna get anything else out of the game.  I&#39;m having great<br/>
  fun doing dragon planning and raiding planes.  After you make L50, <br/>
  I&#39;ve realized that the strain of making levels is lifted, and you can<br/>
  enjoy the game much more.  Again, that&#39;s my take on it as people<br/>
  often like to disagree with me.  But there is no excitement after<br/>
  you&#39;ve done it all, in my opinion.  <br/>
