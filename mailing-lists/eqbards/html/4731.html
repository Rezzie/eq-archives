 </span></blockquote>I had a chance at some Bronze not too long ago and turned it down.<br/>
Personally I prefer the way my Banded looks over Bronze.. I don&#39;t want to<br/>
walk around looking like I came out of an orange grove. (I dont know which<br/>
is better between banded or bronze as I was never interested in the bronze)<br/>
However, I&#39;ve been desperately searching for a replacement head piece for<br/>
the banded one I have. How tacky.</div>
