<div id="ygrps-yiv-44194238">Damn, was last night everyone&#39;s night to die multiple times?  <br/>
I had my first triple-death night since I was trying to help<br/>
someone find and retrieve their corpse in Runnyeye 5 levels<br/>
ago.  Barely held onto 32.  I made the mistake of running back<br/>
to Cazic without a flute, and ended up stuck at the zone with<br/>
a train on one side and a bouncer on the other.  Sometimes<br/>
having a fast computer that zones quickly is not a good<br/>
thing...<br/>
