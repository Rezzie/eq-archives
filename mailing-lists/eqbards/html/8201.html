<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880456665">True, but at the level you are fighting wisps for example a cap of 100 on a<br/>
level based skill is moot; you can&#39;t get there anyway.  They just didnt want<br/>
any melee type running around killing wisps with something they got off a<br/>
level 7 froglock, like woven gloves.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Or did Verant goof and give the melee classes the same<br/>
&gt;H2H cap as monks, and this was their way of fixing it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All melee classes cap at 100 H2H, except monks who go<br/>
up into the 200s.  Which makes sense.<br/>
