<div id="ygrps-yiv-809418428"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Speaking of Instill Doubt, it appears it does not cap at 75 like I had <br/>
&gt; heard, got mine to 78 last night!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  What&#39;s the secret to get it up faster?  I swear, I have practiced<br/>
  it for hours on end while just waiting for a rare spawn, or camping<br/>
  some obscure item - and I have gotten it to 35, but it will not go<br/>
  any higher.  In that same time I got my begging to 20, and my bind<br/>
  wound to 15.  Something must be up.<br/>
