&gt; I love the idea... count me in.  I noticed, when reading the past 10 days&#39; <br/>
&gt; email, that this subject seems to have died down.  I for one would love to <br/>
&gt; have this community get together and do something extravagantly silly like <br/>
&gt; this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sorry about that. My job has got very hectic since I tossed the idea out<br/>
so the time to think and organise it just hasn&#39;t been available. I will<br/>
try to revive the idea when things slow down a bit. <br/>
