&gt; We went in Sebilis in the firsts week of Kunark and, that Mushroom poped on us at the bridge. So it is not<br/>

seen this before the patch. In our case, it wasn&#39;t one mushroom, it was<br/>
10 ilis and krup frogs. One shroom we could have handled.<br/>

moving up? We don&#39;t stay at the bridge area, but we usually pull to<br/>
there to clear for the next stage of advancing deeper.<br/>
