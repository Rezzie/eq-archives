<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-447070574">I have a small suggestion.  Roughly half of the past two digests have been quoted material.  It makes this VERY hard to read, since usually the poster writes a line or two, then quotes many.  Please, cut what is unnecessary from your posts.  For the sake of all of our eyes.  Like the long hours playing EQ weren&#39;t enough... ;)<br/>
<br/>
    PS: Is it even possible to have a guild over more than one server?<br/>
<br/>
May your rhythms be true!<br/>
