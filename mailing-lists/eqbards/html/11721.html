<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724925902">Everyone was right, getting the shin gloves and leggings was fun and easy --<br/>
BUT get yourself a map.  I had done upper guk a little bit at low levels<br/>
(12-13) so I figured hey, how hard can it be to find your way around.  Of<br/>
course everyone who knows how to find their way around guk is now laughing<br/>
at that remark.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, a very nice group found me in the room with the wine kegs and lead<br/>
me to the dead side of lower guk.  I told them why I had made the trip and<br/>
they were very helpful, and pulled the live shin knights to get me the<br/>
gloves even though most were green to them.  My strategy was to remain invis<br/>
during the lives and I would hide during the undead pulls.  Very successful,<br/>
and if you just wait by the hallway once you zone in to lower guk its quite<br/>
safe (assuming you put all your stuff in the bank before you went).  The<br/>
gloves drop with alarming frequency, the legs dropped after about 15<br/>
undeads.<br/>
<br/>
I almost got a basalt carapace that another group offered me however there<br/>
were 2 undead froggies in my way and no way was I going to impose on that<br/>
group by asking them to clear them.  All in all it was a lot of fun, even if<br/>
it did take me 40 mins to get back out (got lost again in upper guk).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and btw: the best dungeon currency is non-summoned food and water.  I<br/>
brought along 2 packs full of milk and muffins.  The other service that is<br/>
useful is trading out plat for the lesser denominations, however I didn&#39;t<br/>
think about that until I was already there.  Next time I go I&#39;ll be sure to<br/>
load up.<br/>
