&gt; if I could help a poor fellow bard buy their level four song.  Remembering how hard the first few levels<br/>
&gt; were, I turned around to take a look.  She was in full bronze!  What, her twinker was too cheap to give<br/>
&gt; her 50 plat?  Of course, she was a wood elf, so I had to cough it up.  (See sucker comment, above...)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Yeah, heh.  Mmmmm woodelves in bronze, damn I would give in too.<br/>
  Seeing that the song was only what? 8gp? hehe.<br/>
