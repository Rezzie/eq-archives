<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472937434">the specific bard disciplines are quite nice actually.  and the inventory<br/>
screen in full screen mode is just awesome.  works while looting and banking<br/>
as well, but not trades.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Bards get these special disciplines:<br/>
&gt; DEFTDANCE (Level 55 - Velious Only): Auto dodge and auto <br/>
&gt; dual-wield.  This discipline lasts for 10 seconds, and has a <br/>
&gt; base reuse time of 72 minutes.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PURETONE (Level 60 - Velious Only): Makes it as if you are <br/>
&gt; wielding the best instrument of every type, whether or not <br/>
&gt; you are actually wielding an instrument.  This discipline <br/>
&gt; lasts for 2 minutes, and has a base reuse time of 72 minutes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s also many UI changes, like being able to close some <br/>
&gt; of the overlays in full screen mode, and being able to access <br/>
&gt; inven in full screen (didn&#39;t read much about this). </span></blockquote></div>
