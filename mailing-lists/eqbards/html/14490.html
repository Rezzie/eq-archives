<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886286650"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think I can answer some of this, and am surprised you didn&#39;t spot it too<br/>
&gt; with all the time you spend there.  The white critters are frogloks I<br/>
&gt; believe.  The one with the glowing eyes is perhaps the first undead froglok?<br/>
&gt; Their eyes are a glowing yellow as I recall.  Did they have a war with the<br/>
&gt; kobolds perhaps?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Why would the kobolds paint frogloks on their walls?  As far as I <br/>
  can tell, I don&#39;t think the kobolds know anything about frogloks.<br/>
<br/>
  I think goblins, firegiants, kobolds, and nagafen are portrayed.<br/>
  But who is who is hard to tell, besides the big dog Nagafen.  If<br/>
  in fact it is Nagafen, it may not be.<br/>
