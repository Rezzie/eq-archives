&gt; &gt;This sucks.  If you want to do a few duels with friends, it means you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt;only be able to use Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge for the first one.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Oh well, only one duel a night I guess.<br/>

&gt;Um. When bards die, they don&#39;t come back with any mana to begin with.<br/>
&gt;Is this different in duels?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry - I guess I should have been more clear.  It appears to only affect <br/>
casters who were using this method to rapidly come back and fight some more <br/>
- allowing them to take down big things that they normally wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
been able to.<br/>
