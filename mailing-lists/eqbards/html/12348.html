&gt; &gt; Damn, you got all that stuff, go trade your Lambent for the Mithril. Get<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Lambent back with the quest items that you have got and then go and<br/>
&gt; &gt; trade the Mithril for some nice Ykesha&#39;s or an FBSS. Now you have it<br/>
&gt; &gt; sorted. Sell your old weapons and you have a nice amount of cash too.<br/>

  Seriously, that wizard doesnt have arms/legs, no melee class<br/>
  would ever bring that wizard anywhere if he did manage to take<br/>
  them, or maybe he ninja&#39;d them.  Brrr..  that&#39;s a scary thought.<br/>
