an eye on what&#39;s around me, I frequently will stand next to a mass-melee<br/>
with the Lullaby going, just to irritate the orcs ;)  While I often end up<br/>
with 4-8 angry orcs on me, it&#39;s never more than I saw (they don&#39;t &quot;come out<br/>
of the woodwork&quot;) and usually I don&#39;t have any real problem with it.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what I&#39;m doing differently?<br/>
