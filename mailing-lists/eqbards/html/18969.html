&gt;Off topic, but I got a pair of Flayed skin Leggings and a Flayed<br/>
&gt;Skin Bracer<br/>
&gt;last nite.  Our guild has no Human or Erudites Necros or Shadowknights so I<br/>
&gt;will be selling or trading the items.  You guys are the most knowledgeable<br/>
&gt;bunch I know, any idea how much these would go for?  Stats listed below for<br/>
&gt;those not wanting to see spoilers. </span></blockquote></div>
