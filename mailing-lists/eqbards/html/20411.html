<div id="ygrps-yiv-71058686">There are lots of &#39;hidden&#39; places for you to practice. I got my brass skill<br/>
up in South Qeynos. if you swim out from the dock and follow the wall to the<br/>
left, you&#39;ll come around to a little beach that is outside the city walls.<br/>
There are no NPCs or PCs back there. It&#39;s a pretty good place and very well<br/>
hidden.</div>
