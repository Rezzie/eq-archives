<div id="ygrps-yiv-90873706"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I know, scary isn&#39;t it?  Considering that pretty much all bards start<br/>
&gt; with a strength under 100 to start, this seems like a mean trick played<br/>
&gt; by Verant.  Add to that the fact that the easiest platemail to get is<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My bard has a strength of 97 after all my magic items are taken into<br/>
&gt; account, and I wear several pieces of bronze plate comfortably.  Could I<br/>
&gt; wear a whole suit?  No way. Can I wear enough to get a very good armour<br/>
&gt; class and to look pretty cool at the same time?  Yes.  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, sounds like a mean trick played on fighters too, considering that my<br/>
ranger has a strength of 80, 81 after magic items. That&#39;s a wood elf<br/>
ranger, with the majority of starting points dumped into strength, then<br/>
dexterity, wisdom and stamina.<br/>
