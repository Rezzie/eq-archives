Since you&#39;re L37, why don&#39;t you test Chain&#39;s slowdown for us<br/>
at L38 and L39?  Just got to a newbie area, find an area away<br/>
from other combat spam, repeatedly Chain a mob, and time how<br/>
long it takes for it to attack you 10 times (the attack when<br/>
you start your stopwatch is #0, not #1).  If it&#39;s 39 seconds,<br/>
then it&#39;s the 30% I observed between L23 and L35.  If it&#39;s<br/>
42-43 sec, then you&#39;re getting the 40% I&#39;m getting at L48.<br/>
