<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338503689">A lot of good ideas here - and of course someone pointed out the<br/>
expensive heavy spell components for the new Necro summon corpse. Verant<br/>
explained they feel this is necessary for &quot;balancing&quot; so you can be sure we<br/>
won&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
    The Locate+Mellifluous Motion is a nice idea.  Another pipe dream idea I<br/>
have (which I doubt we&#39;d ever see - considering how lousy the pathing code<br/>
we already have...  A song for corpse location in dungeons.  Instead of<br/>
pointing you in a straight line direction to the corpse - it would show you<br/>
the direction to actually get to the corpse...<br/>
