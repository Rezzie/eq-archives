nothing for mana (has been tested and timed) you cannot <br/>
dump that type of attitude out on your party.  As a bard<br/>
you are responsible for group coordination through tactics<br/>
and song, unless an enchanter has that current role in your<br/>
group.  You also, imo, are there to keep the group solidly<br/>
happy - with humor/jokes/antics.  If someone in my group <br/>
asked me to play Jig to speed up their mana (a perceived<br/>
notion mind you) - I will happily do it.  I&#39;m not trying<br/>
to mislead them, but if it makes them feel better, most of<br/>
the time the extra security makes them play sharper.<br/>
