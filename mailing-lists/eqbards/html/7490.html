<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; As I have said before, for casual gamers who don&#39;t get <br/>
&gt; to play EQ<br/>
&gt; that much, not being able to bind in non-cities has a major <br/>
&gt; impact.  When I<br/>
&gt; die, that pretty much writes off the rest of the gaming <br/>
&gt; session for me.<br/>
&gt; Thats why I support a change to the policy.  <br/>
