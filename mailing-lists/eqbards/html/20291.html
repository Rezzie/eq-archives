<div id="ygrps-yiv-673549831">YUP, 64 meg of ram is just not enough to really play EQ.  A LOT of zones are<br/>
very laggy with less than 128mb RAM.  And JFYI:  Worst lag zone in the game<br/>
outside kunark is UNREST (and it&#39;s laggier than most kunark zones as well)<br/>
<br/>
Ya can pick up a stick of 64mb 100mhz SDRAM for a very reasonable price<br/>
these days.  I&#39;d highly recommend going to 128 meg.</div>
