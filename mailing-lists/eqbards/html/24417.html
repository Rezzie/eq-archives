<div id="ygrps-yiv-922133977">No SoS is great (in situations).  If you are in a group which lacks healing<br/>
from some reason, put your mandolin in hand and sing SoS, Hymm, SoS as your<br/>
weave.  You will be amazed at how well you mitigate damage.<br/>
<br/>
I am also experimenting with using SoS in the pull group on raids.  WIth the<br/>
new heal rules, the most important part of raids (at least in my opinion) is<br/>
keeping your clerics alive.  Giving the tanks a few extra rounds to build up<br/>
hate, could mean the difference...  Clearly don&#39;t do this is you are feign<br/>
pulling :)</div>
