<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323678848">Has anyone ever gotten EQ to work on a laptop? I&#39;m purchasing a laptop, but<br/>
would like to find one that could run EQ as well so I could run my bard all<br/>
around while I run around. If anyone has any recommendations or experiences,<br/>
please share them.</div>
