in Unrest. Luckily it was a good group with 3 clerics and<br/>
a few tanks. It&#39;s a nice place, but all too often there<br/>
are trains that consist of the *entire* house. On Veeshan<br/>
it&#39;s not uncommon to see 60+ players in that zone. It&#39;s<br/>
really hard not to step on each other&#39;s toes.</div>
