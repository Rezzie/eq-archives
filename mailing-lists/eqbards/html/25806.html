But, just to show how stupid intellectual monopoly laws are, there is a whole<br/>
separate company who has the rights to produce a game based on the /movie/.<br/>
That company, whose name I forget, is /also/ producing a Massive Multiplayer<br/>
persistent world Lord of the Rings game. I don&#39;t know how far along they are,<br/>
but they&#39;re not the same company.<br/>
