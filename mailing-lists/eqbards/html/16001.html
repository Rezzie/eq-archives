<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018802823">Yeah, on Fennin Ro we had some of these back when there were 2,800 people on<br/>
the server.  When there&#39;s that many folks on the game is litterally just<br/>
barely playable.  You are routinely dropped when zoning (sometimes 70% of<br/>
the time).<br/>

Ovurcrowding has deafeated Bandwidth in a duel to the death!<br/>
