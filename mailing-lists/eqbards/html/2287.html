level, whether it&#39;s already aggressive (attacking someone) by<br/>
the time you start using the song, and of course whether or<br/>
not it has see invisible on it.  The song almost always works<br/>
on tormented dead wandering around Unrest, but I tried it last<br/>
night on one that another group was fighting, and it still<br/>
conned as ready to attack.  The implications are not good, but<br/>
would go a long way towards explaining the odd behavior of<br/>
mobs disengaging from people who are fighting them to attack<br/>
passing bards.<br/>
