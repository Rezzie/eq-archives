<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864832744">Yeah, doesn&#39;t work.  Used charm several times last night.  No message.<br/>
But hey, now I can whack magicial only creatures with my lute.  <br/>
Can&#39;t wait for the day that a patch actually addresses some of our issues,<br/>
most importantly the missing songs.<br/>

I got a tell from Cleaver on Fennin Ro last night (Hi Cleaver!) about Charm.<br/>
He was naturally enough curious as to whether I&#39;d seen a message to the<br/>
effect that &quot;Your charm has broken!&quot; as was billed in the patch text.  I had<br/>
not, and am sure disappointed about it.  Has anyone found circumstances in<br/>
which we do receive a &quot;charm breaks&quot; message?  Otherwise I chalk it up to a<br/>
bug or flat-out mistake, like as the &quot;You have gotten better at<br/>
Swimming(71/90)&quot; type messages that we never got.<br/>
