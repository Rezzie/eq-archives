<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136896150">Hello all . . .<br/>
<br/>
	I completed my set of bronze armor, and now I have a few questions about<br/>
it if anyone can help.<br/>
<br/>
	AC continues to be a mystery. It seems to be no more than an overall armor<br/>
rating, which increases with level and with type of armor, and exists only<br/>
so that I can compare AC values with jealous people who still have<br/>
patchwork. Does AC really have a meaning? If so, what does the total AC<br/>
value mean? What does the AC value of a single piece of armor mean?<br/>
<br/>
	Now I know from experience that as soon as I went to full banded, my<br/>
ability to take damage skyrocketed. All of the sudden things which used to<br/>
destroy me just kept missing me or hitting me for 1 damage. This seems to<br/>
suggest it has nothing to do with AC value, and everything to do with armor<br/>
type. The fact that the banded &quot;only&quot; increased my AC by about 25 from<br/>
patchwork was irrelevant. <br/>
<br/>
	Now my bronze &quot;only&quot; increased my AC by about 15, a small amount compared<br/>
to my overall AC, but again my ability to take damage jumped significantly.<br/>
I can again solo everything that is blue.<br/>
<br/>
	I read somewhere that each different type of armor (Leather, Chain, Plate<br/>
and its equivalents) can absorb more and different types of damage as the<br/>
armor gets better. This seems to be true, and seems to make the AC value<br/>
worthless . . .<br/>
<br/>
	Besides, full bronze looks really cool.<br/>
<br/>
	Please comment . . . <br/>
