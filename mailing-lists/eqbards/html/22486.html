<div id="ygrps-yiv-1812939827">i agree, it&#39;s been a pretty bad year other than Gladiator, and i even hyped<br/>
myself up a little too much for that.  i hope i am safe having huge<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I no longer expect anything when I see a movie which actually <br/>
&gt; lets me enjoy one every now an then.<br/>
