&gt; outside that are 5th - 6th level. I believe it to be the best place for going<br/>
&gt; from 6th to 9th (assuming you can live with a long walk if you die). With a<br/>
&gt; group you could even head inside and hunt everything before the first bridge<br/>
&gt; (you&#39;ll see it when you go in a little and thru some doors).<br/>
