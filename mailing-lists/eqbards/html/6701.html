<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712851722">Last night I PvP&#39;d a rogue friend of mine (he&#39;s 27 and I&#39;m 24), he had 2<br/>
proc&#39;ing weapons, and I got him down into his las two bubbles of health.<br/>
Not bad for being 3 levels under him and having no proc&#39;ing weapons of my<br/>
own.  I think we are balanced just fine :o)  (Although I still feel it goes<br/>
against all of the bard lore that Verant has fed us for bards to NOT be able<br/>
to bind themselves)<br/>
