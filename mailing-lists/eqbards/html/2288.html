Thanks for all the great input on my weapons question.  After two nights of<br/>
grouping with a friend to kill the hermit in SK (he&#39;s around lvl 21-23 I<br/>
think, and is at -5411, -2646), I now have enough to buy a Dirk (just<br/>
shelled out 50pp on banded so I&#39;m rebuilding my funds).  Speaking of Ye Olde<br/>
Hermit, he gives out a cracked flute and the first sheet of the WInds of<br/>
Karana (to give to the bard at the water fountain in SK), does anyone know<br/>
if this quest works, or where the other sheet(s) are?<br/>
    Also, is any particular instrument better than any other?  (ie:  Is my<br/>
mino horn better or worse than my brass horn. etc)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
