<div id="ygrps-yiv-336647063">Hi!  I am fairly new to the list and wanted to know if anyone had some<br/>
suggestions for me on what songs make the best combos for juggling/twisting.<br/>
I have several songs that I rarely if ever use because they always seem to<br/>
get me killed but have seen recent suggestions on mssg boards that said they<br/>
were quite good for use in fights and in duels as well.  I was wondering<br/>
what others&#39; experiences or suggestions were with any songs or combinations<br/>
there of.  <br/>
