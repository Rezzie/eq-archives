&gt; In my experience, Chains is much less desirable than snare or root for such<br/>

&gt; Chains, I believe, only slows (does not stop) mobs that have &gt;25% health<br/>

The engulfing darkness line of spells is even worse, as it<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to immobilize runners until they&#39;re at about<br/>
20%.  i.e. mobs that try to run *can* run until you do a bit<br/>
more damage to get them to stop.<br/>
