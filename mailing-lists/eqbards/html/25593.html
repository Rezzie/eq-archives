<div id="ygrps-yiv-319424891">I gotta say that all questions about where to hunt, how to do things, what <br/>
equip etc. can all be found in one wonderful location: www.eqdiva.com<br/>
<br/>
That site has helped me get to (just shy of) 52 in a little over 5 months <br/>
of only part-time playing.  There is SO much information there, the forums <br/>
have so many knowledgeable people, its really amazing.  You should check it <br/>
out.<br/>
