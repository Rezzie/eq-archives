<div id="ygrps-yiv-426821501">I strongly suspect this question stems from lack of experience, so please<br/>
bear with me.<br/>
Even if I have hot buttons for my melee weapon and instrument, don&#39;t I have<br/>
to still drag either item to my melee slot on my inventory screen to be<br/>
using it? How can a hot key speed this process up?<br/>
<br/>
Any assistance would be appreciated.<br/>

&gt;Tip #1: You can drag inventory / equipment slots to your hot buttons the<br/>
&gt;same way as any of the buttons (just left click and hold til it &quot;comes<br/>
&gt;off&quot;). This allows you to manipulate your inventory from the normal<br/>
&gt;interface screen without having to go to inventory. So what I do is have my<br/>
&gt;weapon, shield and instruments all on the same button panel and can now<br/>
&gt;switch back and forth while running, no problem.<br/>
