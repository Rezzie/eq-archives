<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845575341">You can become OK in Neriak by killing those bandits outside the city,<br/>
however you will smush your faction with their cities (I think they&#39;re<br/>
gnomes).  Oggok and Grobb have no + factions monsters that I know of.<br/>
Oddly they dont like you if you kill lots of froggies or lizzies.  Guess<br/>
they&#39;re just trolls (and ogres)<br/>
