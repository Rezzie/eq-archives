<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985494085">On the other hand, I have a 16th level bard, with<br/>
over 20 days played.  I&#39;ve been all over Norrath<br/>
(and died in most of them).  I&#39;ve been bound<br/>
precisely twice.  Both times, I waited until peak<br/>
hours, sat myself at the gates, and auctioned<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ll pay 1 plat for a bind at &lt;insert gate&gt;&quot;.  I&#39;ve<br/>
had to repeat this several times, at 30 second <br/>
intervals, for, at most 5 min.<br/>
<br/>
I have fought in CB while bound in Freeport, <br/>
fought in Highpass, bound in Freeport, fought<br/>
in Innothule and Guk while, well you get the <br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t like waiting for a bind, half the classes<br/>
can bind.</div>
