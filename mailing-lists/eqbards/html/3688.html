<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1245085367">I am writing to the fellow bards to see if anyone has noticed<br/>
that Selos Accelerando has slowed to a crawl (relatively =) even<br/>
when we have the drum equipped! ... I have been having a rather<br/>
large amount of connection problems so I am not quite sure if<br/>
it has been slowed indeed or my 40% average PL (my fault, router<br/>
is going bad) is the culprit.<br/>
