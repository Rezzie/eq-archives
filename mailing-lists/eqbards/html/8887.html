&gt;Speaking of which, does anyone know what mobs are linked with griffennes?<br/>

Griffenne Spawn point<br/>

In North Karana at 1022 413 is a pillar. Anytime I killed a Griffenne , it <br/>
wouldrespawn right at this pillar. I killed about 15 in a row with no more <br/>
than a couple minutes between spawns. Once I figured this out I got my 2 <br/>
bracers rather quickly. So after you kill any griffenne head to that area, <br/>
you will see another rapidly.<br/>
