&gt; rathe mountains is and always has been bad for warpers, there&#39;s a spot that<br/>
&gt; we hunt hg&#39;s at and if the monsters get to a certain little bump in the<br/>
&gt; terrain, get ready for trains of em to come back at ya... anything that goes<br/>
&gt; over this pathing location will warp away and take a long time to come back.<br/>
&gt; This is close to the hill giant hill with the 2 guards on the top. Hg&#39;s,<br/>
&gt; giant skels, lizards, cycs, basilisks, anything that goes here warps. Sorry<br/>
&gt; i dont have the loc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oasis has a very bad warp spot as well, right by the water just south of &quot;pillar one&quot;.  You only<br/>
notice it with things that are running away, like orc warriors or things that have been feared.<br/>
<br/>
Most of these warp spots have set &quot;beam in&quot; locations, so if you get used to them, you can adapt.<br/>
