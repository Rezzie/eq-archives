&gt; am going to go for some more CHA and AC, my CHA is a pitiful 103 (i&#39;m coming<br/>
&gt; over to the good side, Harm).  i fear i may go into a seizure if my STR goes<br/>
&gt; under 140, but i&#39;m going to risk it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s funny that you mention that, I&#39;m going to cut my dex/cha down<br/>
  and go with more str/ac too.  hehe.<br/>
