<div id="ygrps-yiv-517423857">What are these? This a smithed item, or part of a quest that requires<br/>
smithing? They seem to be far superior in AC at least to the PoA quest<br/>
Songweaver&#39;s Mantle (9ac 7dex 5cha/agi)... And I&#39;ve noticed that no one has<br/>
said they even have these. Is the quest all that hard, are bards just not<br/>
recognized in PoA, or is it just that bad compared to the other shoulder<br/>
items cropping up these days?<br/>
