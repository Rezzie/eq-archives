I have zero doubt that the druid will lose.  They have far too poor an AC to<br/>
compete.  The Shaman on the other hand had a strength 50 points higher than<br/>
me and a stamina 40 points higher.  He had nearly 25% more hit points than I<br/>
did at the same level and an ac a whopping 7 points lower.  That would be<br/>
difficult to overcome.  The difference in our weapon skill was 18 points.<br/>
It mattered not one iota.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way it takes me well over a minute to beat up an Ice Boned skel in<br/>
melee alone.  Multiply me by three it still takes more than the &#39;laughable&#39;<br/>
20 seconds it took the three druids.  For me its merely miss, miss, pierce<br/>
11, miss, miss, pierce 9...<br/>
