<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134336738">I am right before the Ravager or something&#39;s room.  It is a room behind the<br/>
library, down a small tunnel.<br/>
<br/>
A typical group would be lvls 35-40 druid, enchanter, ranger, warrior.<br/>
Possibly another ranger, druid, enchanter or shaman.  We have a serious lack<br/>
of diversity in our guild.  Of the main group, there is one person with no<br/>
human blood I think.  (High elf enchanter)  All the rest are human, half<br/>
elf, barbarian or Erudite.  We have one wiz above 30 and no necros or<br/>
mages...</div>
