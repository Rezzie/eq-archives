 </span></blockquote>Whoa!  Aren&#39;t we confusing Cyclops here?  Broon, Droon and (Papa) Proon hang<br/>
out in East Karana.  I thought Choon and his buddy (Foon?) were someplace<br/>
else (North Karana??).  As far as I know, Broon, Droon and Proon have<br/>
nothing to do with the Lambent quest (Choon and friend do though).<br/>
