I really encourage those of you that didn&#39;t do Upper Guk for experience all<br/>
through your 20s and 30s to invis and wander around in Upper Guk.  The place<br/>
is one of the largest zones in the game and has some really amazing places<br/>
in it.  Now that I&#39;m starting to play twinks I am really looking forward to<br/>
playing in there this time around.  If the frogs trained ever so slightly<br/>
less (or at least didn&#39;t SoW themselves indoors) I think players would<br/>
*love* this place.<br/>

&gt; UGuk is a lot bigger than most people think.  There are vast<br/>
&gt; areas full of shin warriors and knights most of which will<br/>
&gt; give experience up to about 40. </span></blockquote></div>
