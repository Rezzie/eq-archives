<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888050311">The EQ live thing says servers are up... its 541 EST<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if this is true because when i try to patch it laggs my whole<br/>
computer and it doesn&#39;t start patching or anything...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the evercoming stream of info</div>
