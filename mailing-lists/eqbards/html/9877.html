I know i have a relatively low level bard so she won&#39;t be able to hang<br/>
with you...but my druid would be happy to join up with you.  I have<br/>
someplace to take you and you are a very good level to go...not to<br/>
mention that your bard songs will kick ass here....or I would be happy<br/>
to go kill some HG with you...and my lvl 31 ranger friend.  Between all<br/>
of us we can definately go giant hunting *evil grin*  I will look you<br/>
up with my druid..Crysarra.  I know we have talked in game before...so<br/>
give me a tell and if you want we can group up.  <br/>

&gt; if you are<br/>
&gt; online.  Maybe we can all get together and work on getting quest<br/>
&gt; components for<br/>
&gt; our armor.  I&#39;m getting tired of MM and was thinking about heading to<br/>
&gt; Solusek.<br/>
&gt; An enchanter friend who is 35th level has already agreed to help me<br/>
&gt; fight giants<br/>
&gt; in order to get some lambent stones as well.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Take care<br/>
