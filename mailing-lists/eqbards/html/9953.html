<div id="ygrps-yiv-1640455289">Thus far, I&#39;m the only person who&#39;s voted that sneak is useful.  If you<br/>
sneak behind a merchant, you can deal with them because they will regard<br/>
you as indifferent.  I&#39;ve gotten the best possible prices (Greater<br/>
Lightstone 4.286p) in Ogguk, South Karana (aviak vendor), South Ro (Dark<br/>
Elf camp) and the brownie camp in Lesser Faydark (who took the Carrilon so<br/>
they wouldn&#39;t kill me, then sneak so they would sell to me).<br/>
<br/>
Not the intended use for it, but useful nonetheless.  Don&#39;t tell Verant<br/>
about it though. :/<br/>
