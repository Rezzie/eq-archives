<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088944935">See Invis song: useful for taking blind barbs across many zones to find<br/>
their bodies. Did this many many times in the early days when only a handful<br/>
of Uber ones were 30+. Generally, later levels you want a see invis to know<br/>
if someone just went past your camp: a) they may be scouting a KS, b) if<br/>
their invis blows you know who brought that major train. For songs, I like<br/>
to think we have a song for every occasion, sometimes more than one. Some<br/>
I&#39;ve never used or used only once or don&#39;t use now, but maybe the right<br/>
situation just hasn&#39;t presented itself.<br/>

Glowing Stone Band: comes out of Sol A, near the Goblin King?<br/>
<br/>
Brain Bite Quest: It&#39;s a 39th wizzy spell quest. Note I listed my wizzy in<br/>
my sig, as she&#39;s just recently done 30 to 40, she knows more about exp at<br/>
that range than my bard, who was over that level when Kunark came out. My<br/>
bard did the mid 20s to low 30&#39;s in Upper Guk, camping Ghoulsbanes with<br/>
guildmates. I love the croak a dying frog makes!<br/>
<br/>
Nailed down for Clarity: it&#39;s easier than you think. My regular groupmates<br/>
all have these wonderful emotes to remind me when I&#39;ve forgotten to turn the<br/>
clarity on for them. Most involve *choke*, *gasp*, etc. And one is my<br/>
cleric, who is at his computer right beside me. /poke becomes literal. From<br/>
a strategy standpoint, it&#39;s our usual practice to send the monk out to pull,<br/>
especially in case of unknowns. I pull when it takes superior speed!<br/>
