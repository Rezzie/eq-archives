<div id="ygrps-yiv-18597611">Hey, I love doing that.  I just got Aria and I mem it when I&#39;m running from<br/>
Freeport to Cazic-Thule.  It really shaves off some time to twist those two<br/>
songs.  Most notably in Oasis and Innothule where the dunes and swampwater<br/>
don&#39;t slow me down any longer.  Running around Lake Rathe is a snap now too.<br/>
