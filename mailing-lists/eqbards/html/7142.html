<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375652003">Okay, this is the official Kabong! <br/>
We don&#39;t need name calling, no matter how frustrated you are.  I shouldn&#39;t<br/>
have let this thread go on so long, but it&#39;s a pet topic of mine on the<br/>
newsgroup, I should have realized even Bards would get &quot;flamboyant&quot; about it.<br/>
<br/>
We now return you to your regularly scheduled broadcast.<br/>
