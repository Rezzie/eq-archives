<div id="ygrps-yiv-522027860">You&#39;re wrong about guide&#39;s not helping with corpses in lava.  I<br/>
spoke with a guide recently who told me that in the past few weeks there&#39;s<br/>
been a change to where all corpses in lava are considered irretrievable<br/>
(meaning they will move it out of the lava for you).<br/>
