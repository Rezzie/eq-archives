<div id="ygrps-yiv-403540286"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Michael is right - Snare is superior in effect to chains when it works, i <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t understand why this is being argued. There are disadvantages to both: <br/>
&gt; Ensnare cost mana (big w00p, it&#39;s lvl 1 druid spell), and caster must stand <br/>
&gt; still. Chains does not last very long, but the cool thing about it is you <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just a minor point, but make sure your druid is using Snare, NOT Ensnare.<br/>
Snare is a level 1 spell, Ensnare is a level 24/29/34 (forget which)<br/>
spell. Snare lasts a set time, Ensnare is inferior -- it costs more mana<br/>
and usually runs out in 3-9 seconds.</div>
