&gt; The juggling is EXACTLY what I do as a RL solo club musician.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
the song that continues when you stop singing.  It&#39;s the EFFECT that the<br/>
song has on you.  When I sing a sad song, the listener doesn&#39;t stop feeling<br/>
sad immediately after I stop singing.  It&#39;s this *effect* that carries over<br/>
into the next song.  If the next song is a toe-tapper, the audience may<br/>
still feel a little sad for a while even as they start tapping.<br/>
