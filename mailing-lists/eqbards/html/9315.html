<div id="ygrps-yiv-329790731"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If you haven&#39;t done it yet, grouping with only melee classes<br/>
&gt; is a lot of fun.  The above is true - if everyone distributes<br/>
&gt; damage well, except for the tough fights you basically have<br/>
&gt; zero downtime.  Someone goes to pull the next mob while you<br/>
&gt; top off every else&#39;s health.  The only downside is that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; very nervewracking (for the bard at least) playing without a<br/>
&gt; primary healer.  Having a paldin with lay hands helps<br/>
&gt; tremendously in easing that fear.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Amen brother.  If I had my way, I would group exclusively with melee&#39;ers<br/>
only.  Not matter what we/I do, grouping with casters is a complete<br/>
nightmare as far as downtime goes.  SOOO BORING.  Hopefully when I make 32nd<br/>
level it will help a bit.<br/>
