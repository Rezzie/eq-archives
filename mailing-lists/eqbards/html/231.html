<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552896937">Hail, fellow bards.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the bard class (figure i&#39;ll play one monday on the new server), <br/>
and had a few questions for you.<br/>
<br/>
First, i noticed that bards can wear plate armor.  How much strenghth is <br/>
required to wear a full suit of plate armor and still run around and be able <br/>
to grab some loot?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard Dexterity has an affect on how well bards play their instruments.  <br/>
How big of an affect is this?  Should i max my dexterity to ensure that i&#39;m <br/>
good at playing instruments?<br/>
<br/>
Also, i&#39;ve heard that since bard spells don&#39;t use mana, they can play <br/>
indefinately, is this true?  How does the whole &quot;song&quot; thing work?<br/>
<br/>
I guess these questions probably get asked a lot...  if there&#39;s a FAQ or <br/>
something i could check our, just point me to it...<br/>
<br/>
thanks all.<br/>
<br/>
