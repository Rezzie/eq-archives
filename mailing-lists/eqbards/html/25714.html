<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776977735">have any of you guys ever been into AoE groups? i bet you have ;)<br/>
<br/>
well i have been invited many times but never had the opportunity to join<br/>
one, though they say bards are needed. now i am not sure how aoe groups<br/>
exactly work and what a bards role in such a group is, so any advice is<br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
i only know the bard should pull a lot of mobs, which get chainstunned by 2<br/>
chanters and then smoked by 3 AoE nukers. but do i sing anything else? any<br/>
special hint?<br/>
<br/>
so long<br/>
