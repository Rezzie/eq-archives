<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457152196">BTW, one primary problem with the Box of Abu-Kar change was<br/>
that when they nerfed the box (100% -&gt; 10% weight reduction),<br/>
they were punishing everyone who got the box legitimately just<br/>
because a few people got it from a level 7 mob.  With a guise<br/>
fix, they would&#39;ve only been punishing the people who weren&#39;t<br/>
supposed to be able to use it in the first place.<br/>
