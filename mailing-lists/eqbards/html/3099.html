fall upon the bards to shape the language.  But can we even shape it among<br/>
ourselves, when speaking of our own unique abilities?<br/>
<br/>
I can only hope.<br/>
<br/>
Can we agree on a word for the interweaving of multiple spellsongs?  Can we<br/>
begin to use it religiously ourselves, first here and then among others?<br/>
Can we change the language of Norrath?<br/>
<br/>
Of the terms so far, I rather like &quot;weaving.&quot;  It has the correct<br/>
denotation and good connotations for blending strands that are similar but<br/>
distinct, to create a fabric that is stronger and more useful than the<br/>
individual strands.  It&#39;s short, clean, and to the point.<br/>
<br/>
Do we have the interest and self-discipline to pick a word and effect a change?<br/>
<br/>
Today, perhaps, &quot;weaving,&quot; some day, with victories behind us, we can take<br/>
on &quot;proc.&quot;  :-)<br/>
