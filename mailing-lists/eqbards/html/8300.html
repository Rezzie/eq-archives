&gt;Have you addressed any of the topics in the GZ letter with your &quot;Deep<br/>
&gt;Throat&quot;?  Have we even got confirmation from GZ that he has received and<br/>
&gt;read the letter?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>heh.  Deep Throat and I had a long talk about it, but he wasn&#39;t all that<br/>
confident about some of our points.  However, he is not a programmer or<br/>
designer, or really all that important - just someone who seems to get the<br/>
info before we do ;)<br/>
