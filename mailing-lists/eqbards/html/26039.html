<div id="ygrps-yiv-93159427">Anyone know the Mod on the lute that drops in Siren&#39;s Grotto?<br/>
<br/>
10 Ac and 25 HP is kind of cool, esp for fungus grove aoe partnering.  Is <br/>
it any better than combine/princess?<br/>
<br/>
Been hearing til you get the lute from Griegs that the mods are all pretty <br/>
much the same.<br/>
