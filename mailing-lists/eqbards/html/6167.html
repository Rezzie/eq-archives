&gt; L32 Clarity supposedly *does* stack with multiple bards<br/>
&gt; singing it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tested that with first 2 bards and later 3 in my party the other day in<br/>
Cazic. The casters in the group (one an enchanter who kept everyone<br/>
claritied) were shocked at the increase in their mana regen. I didn&#39;t time<br/>
it because it was a random group I joined, but the casters all said there<br/>
was a noticeable difference between two bards and three.<br/>
