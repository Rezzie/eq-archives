<div id="ygrps-yiv-348748726">lambent stone is lore, it is not no drop.  it is apparently a rare drop on<br/>
the HGs, SGs, and Griffs.  i was unable to loot one, i was lucky to have one<br/>
given to me.  then i lost it in the breastplate quest, going to talk to the<br/>
server GM later.<br/>

&gt; It has been pstulated that Lambent Stones may not be No Drop <br/>
&gt; since several<br/>
&gt; different classes can use them for quests.  Shada you have had these<br/>
&gt; apparently, care to weigh in?<br/>
