<div id="ygrps-yiv-580570807">Well the best that I have done was grouping with 2 other bards and 3<br/>
rangers.  This was way back at level 11, but suffice to say we were able<br/>
to mow down orcs in Crush without a care in the world.  Nothing beats<br/>
having hymn, selo and anthem all running at the same time.  Now if we were<br/>
all level 12 then it would have been even better =).<br/>
