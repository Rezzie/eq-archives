<b>Subject:</b> New Lullaby theory <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-82966207">This theory came up on the concert hall board.  A bard there<br/>
claimed to have used Lullaby with great success in Runnyeye.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, my new theory is that somewhere in the resist check<br/>
when GZ should&#39;ve used the mob&#39;s level, he accidently used the<br/>
bard&#39;s level.  So if you (the bard) are relatively low level,<br/>
the song works reasonably well against even con mobs.  But if<br/>
you are high level, the minimum resist rate is that of a high<br/>
level mob.<br/>
<br/>
It has a lot of holes, but it warrants checking out.  So if<br/>
you are L15-25 or so, could you try logging some of your<br/>
Lullaby episodes?  If I remember, Kitasi is about the right<br/>
level for Runnyeye, no?  :)  You can pull out the data<br/>
yourself, or email the logfile to me and I&#39;ll do it.<br/>
