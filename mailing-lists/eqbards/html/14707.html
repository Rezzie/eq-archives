<div id="ygrps-yiv-681301887">The following may not be ethical to some of you but oh well.. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I have been lacking in time lately to play my bard.. he is level 23. I have some high level friends<br/>
who have offered to power me up some. They are all late 20&#39;s to mid 30&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Question is what to kill and where? Any suggestions? As in what gives great XP that with the help of<br/>
a level 29 Druid or level 35 Shaman can I kill?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance<br/>
