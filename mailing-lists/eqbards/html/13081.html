<div id="ygrps-yiv-214622603">I guess this can be on the list of - you know you&#39;re playing too much Everquest when...<br/>
<br/>
    Was playing in one of my bands last night - where they need to balance the solos between the three horns better - most of the solos go to the baritone sax (go figure)..<br/>
<br/>
    So anyway - we get a new version of a tune and instead of all three horns getting solos - there are only two (for me - trombone and the alto sax) and I think to myself &quot;Wow, they nerfed the baritone part...&quot;<br/>
