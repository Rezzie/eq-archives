<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418271006">snip Speaking personally, the guild I&#39;m in is the New OutRiders, and<br/>
has been around for the better part of a decade (started on the old INN<br/>
network in Ysebrius) snip<br/>
<br/>
	Do you remember an old guild there named Masters of Ysebrius?  A few<br/>
guys in DOA are old MOY members.</div>
