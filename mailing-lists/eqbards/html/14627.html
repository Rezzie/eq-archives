<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757173969"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; But when the<br/>
&gt; expansion comes out, the new zones will/should contain the new high level<br/>
&gt; mobs/items (geared toward the 50+ player).  Vox/Nagafen  and plane loot<br/>
&gt; should remain geared towards the 45-50 level players (of course they can add<br/>
&gt; new dragons in the expansion geared towards the 50+ players<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is exactly what Verant will do...since to do otherwise would<br/>
alienate current high-levels and low-levels alike.  Let&#39;s pretend that the new<br/>
level limit is 75.  If Verant raises the Dragons and Planes to level 75, then<br/>
people will fight for 25 levels to kill the stuff they killed 25 levels<br/>
earlier.<br/>
<br/>
The key for Verant is to come up with new mobs and zones for the 50+ crowd<br/>
that is good enough to keep them from going back on Dragon raids and such.<br/>
That way, each new crop of level 50s can experience the fun of a Dragon raid<br/>
and keep going from there.</div>
