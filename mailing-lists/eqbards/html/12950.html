&gt; &gt; I think out of all the classes that really are screwed up, <br/>

&gt; You can do a /who all bard count, /who all rogue count, etc.<br/>
&gt; to get numbers for all the non-anonymous players on the<br/>

bards. I would guess we are around the median for the groups. I forgot about<br/>
shadowknights. I haven&#39;t grouped with a shadowknight since about May. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I did read a post from either Brad or GZ talking about Rogues and that<br/>
they&#39;ve upped their combat abilities so that they do and sometimes exceed<br/>
monk damage (if backstabbing of course) and that they can wear better armor.<br/>
Sorry I don&#39;t have the quote handy.<br/>
