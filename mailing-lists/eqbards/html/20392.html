 </span></blockquote>No kidding. Newbie bard made level 12 last night in Kurn&#39;s Tower! Woot! <br/>
<br/>
As a tip for anyone who doesn&#39;t have a problem using mules, I parked Bertie<br/>
the level 1 Iksar warrior inside Kurn&#39;s. Whenever newbie bard dies (heh, I<br/>
think it is 3 runs from FV so far) Bertie loots him of all his coin,his<br/>
extra Corpse Run drums and any items to sell (that aren&#39;t in a pack)  and<br/>
goes back to sleep. He will eventually go sell then selflessly leap to his<br/>
death and consent Newbie Bard. This will save Newbie bard a 400 ton waddle<br/>
from Kurns to FV.<br/>
