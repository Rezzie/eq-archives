<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036803762">Well Dark you wouldn&#39;t being experiencing anything if you weren&#39;t on the<br/>
raid.  And if you weren&#39;t on the raid, the raid wouldn&#39;t be noticing<br/>
anything different either.  You need, &quot;need&quot; not want, 1 bard on a raid.<br/>
Any more bards would be better replaced by another class.<br/>

I&#39;m in total agreement.  I can&#39;t speak for solo play, but in group play<br/>
we simply kick ass.  Even on raids, with the right guild that knows how<br/>
to use us, we&#39;re no slouches.  Thott throws out a lot of numbers about<br/>
how we don&#39;t scale well as we level, but somehow his analysis doesn&#39;t<br/>
mirror my experiences on a daily basis.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully VI is just looking at &quot;stacking issues&quot; and not anything more<br/>
grand. :)<br/>
