Bards are better than Paladins/Rangers in spell combat.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any doubt of the above statements, duel one using just combat or<br/>
spells where appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
Many (most) of the Bard songs improve the entire group.  A solo Bard is like<br/>
fighting with one arm tied behind your back.  Comparing Bards to any other<br/>
class in solo capabilities is not a fair comparison of the overall<br/>
powerfulness of a class.<br/>
<br/>
Bard songs will never be as magically powerful as other casters (pure and<br/>
priest types).  But Bards have a huge advantage of never needed mana (lvl 43<br/>
song excepted).  It is not a fair to compare the effectiveness of a bard<br/>
song which can be repeated as much as needed to a spell which comsumes mana.<br/>
<br/>
The above statements are facts and cannot be disputed.  Every Bard should<br/>
understand these facts.  If you base your discussion on something to the<br/>
contrary, your whole logic chain falls apart.<br/>
