<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336298873">better yet, the ranger spell is resistable, thus when resisted instead of<br/>
lowering hate, you go straight to the top.  56 ranger friend tried it and<br/>
died instantly the first time.  i believe he logged out very soon<br/>
thereafter.<br/>

&gt; Gotta love that one.  They couldn&#39;t own up to the fact they <br/>
&gt; screwed up by<br/>
&gt; not increasing the ranger defensive stats, so to save face <br/>
&gt; they give Rangers<br/>
&gt; a spell to lower their hate list factor.  So much for <br/>
&gt; Symphonic Harmony<br/>
&gt; being unique to bards. </span></blockquote></div>
