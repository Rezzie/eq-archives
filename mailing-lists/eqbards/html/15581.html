<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024729714">Okay folks, some of you have been a bit remiss in your bumping duties.  Sure the new thread is on page 6 (making a total of 14 pages thus far).  Yes, the thread had to be split by players.  But does that mean we give up?  Not me ;o)~<br/>
Feel free to stop by and bump it to the moon and back if necessary  (oh yeah, some lugnut posted a cursing flame that was pulled by the admin, so at least THEY know of the thread :oP  )<br/>
