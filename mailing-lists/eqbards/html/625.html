<div id="ygrps-yiv-227025001">Just thought of this...<br/>
<br/>
Possible *SPOILER* for some:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone completed the quest from Valen Nostrolo in South Karana? He was<br/>
completing a song and needed two pages. It is possible that the reward could be<br/>
one of the missing songs. I am not high enough level to complete the quest yet,<br/>
so don&#39;t know what you get.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought...</div>
