<div id="ygrps-yiv-347174896">I picked up a Symponic Sabre last week (11/23, 10cha, 5int, effect:<br/>
symphonic harmony)<br/>
Every time the effect procs, I get a message that says &quot;Item is out of<br/>
charges&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else seen this?  Or have any idea what symphonic harmony does yet?<br/>
I&#39;m assuming its busted, it never had charges, nor have I ever seen a<br/>
charge-based proc.<br/>
