<div id="ygrps-yiv-773847573">Has there been anything difinative(said by the bard programmer) about a <br/>
bards agility stat being used to check if the bard has succesfully used his <br/>
dodge skill?<br/>
<br/>
In other words is it worth while for bards to raise their agility so they <br/>
dodge more often?<br/>
<br/>
