Isn&#39;t it typical that they can fix a song that&#39;s only been in the game for<br/>
two months and was only recently discovered as &#39;buggy&#39; but they *still*<br/>
haven&#39;t addressed the problems with songs that have been broken since last<br/>

<br/>
Kinda makes you wonder if they only fixed it because they were able to<br/>
change a &#39;+&#39; to a &#39;-&#39;. ;)<br/>
