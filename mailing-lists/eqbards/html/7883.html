I tend to just auction that I&#39;m looking for spider silks and pelts and<br/>
buy them for 2-4gp each depending.  In the Karanas and Everfrost<br/>
(where I&#39;ve been hanging out lately) I can usually get a pretty good<br/>
haul that way, along with killing the occasional fuzzy or spider<br/>
myself.  Another question though, are animal skins worth anything to a<br/>
tailor (skins, not pelts)? <br/>
