<div id="ygrps-yiv-972733299">dunno if that is true or not.  on certain mobs you do have to be in melee<br/>
range to cast on them, but it is always necessary against tough mobs because<br/>
you don&#39;t want the &quot;ping pong&quot; effect where you pull the mob to you and away<br/>
from all the tanks beating up on it.<br/>

&gt; Often times when I have watched my woman play in Hate she <br/>
&gt; must be right<br/>
&gt; outside the melee circle or the resists are terrible.  I&#39;d assume that<br/>
&gt; it is the same with songs. </span></blockquote></div>
