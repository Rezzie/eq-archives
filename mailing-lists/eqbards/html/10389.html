<div id="ygrps-yiv-420614023">Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be getting Denon&#39;s next level, and will be starting to try and solo<br/>
using it.  I&#39;m wondering how much damage it does.  Does it tell you, or is<br/>
it like CoD, and all you get is &quot;blahblah winces&quot;?  (How much damage does<br/>
CoD do, anyway?)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</div>
