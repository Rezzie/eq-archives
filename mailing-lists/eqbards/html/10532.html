<br/>
Sylly<br/>
<br/>
p.s. and I thot that I heard they were gonna fix this one but last Saturday<br/>
morning, right there in the Upper Guk Jail room...  a froglok shaman begins<br/>
to cast a spell... a froglok shaman is surrounded by a brief lupine aura...<br/>
<br/>
p.s.s. is it just me or how come Verant has such a low opinion of bards?<br/>
They design dungeons and populate them with these mobs: knights, warriors,<br/>
shamen, wizards, enchanters, etc.  so where do they put the bards?  Hello a<br/>
Sylly are you [interested] in helping deliver some [mail]?<br/>

		Is it just me - or are some of the things NPCs allowed to do<br/>
that we can&#39;t<br/>
		just really out of wack?<br/>
<br/>
		Seemingly endless manna<br/>
		Seemingly limitless casting range<br/>
		Able to affect folks WELL outside normal range limits<br/>
		Able to have multiple pets<br/>
<br/>
		Lets see - anything I&#39;ve forgotten?</div>
