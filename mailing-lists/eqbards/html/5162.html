<div id="ygrps-yiv-478598318">Please, when replying to a long post, snip the post. If you must<br/>
sprinkle comments, snip all but the part you are commenting on.<br/>
<br/>
I have free email and a fast connection, but not everyone does. Some of<br/>
our friends outside the U.S. pay for every minute of downloads and<br/>
sometimes even for kb of mailbox use. Please be considerate to them.</div>
