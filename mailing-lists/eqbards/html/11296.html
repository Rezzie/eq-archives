The thing is I really don&#39;t believe it matters if you get their attention or<br/>
not. Because smed showed up at the monk sit in every class now is talking<br/>
about having a sit in which is going to make it worthless. Also if Verant<br/>
really thought there was some problems with the Bard class then theywould<br/>
change it and it&#39;s close to impossible to change someboody&#39;s mind about<br/>
this. Look at necros all I heard were the normal complaints of any class and<br/>
verant just recently changed the screaming terror spell. It will happenwhen<br/>
and if Verant wants it to not when you or any other custuomer wants it to.<br/>
Naeeldar<br/>
<br/>
Which is unacceptable.  If Verant continues to treat me as a customer like a<br/>
criminal, which believe me is how they do, I will leave the game.  I&#39;m<br/>
already paid for a few more months, but if nothing changes for the better<br/>
I&#39;m outta here.  I don&#39;t need to be treated like crap and have plenty of<br/>
other things I can do.  I will miss many of the friends I&#39;ve made thru EQ,<br/>
but more and more of them are leaving anyhow.<br/>
