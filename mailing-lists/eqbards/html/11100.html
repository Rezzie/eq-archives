<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050132582">The thing I really hate about levitate being broken is this: The other<br/>
day (pre-patch) I was trotting across Lake Rathe, and decided to twist<br/>
Aria and Selo&#39;s. I was making good time when I heard this:<br/>
<br/>
Pesmerga shouts &quot;Was that a bolt of lighting acroos the water, or a Bard<br/>
delivering a pizza?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now, these joys are no more :(<br/>
