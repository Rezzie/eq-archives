<div id="ygrps-yiv-425859225">Well Illusion Dark Elf (I am a worshipper of Erollsi Marr if that<br/>
matters)didn&#39;t work, so I will have to get a group (need them anyway for<br/>
Doppelganger, so no big deal) then either try to sneak up on him or charm<br/>
him.  Our plan is to harmony him and pull the rest away for their funerals.<br/>
Then he will be left alone without waiting for respawn...<br/>
