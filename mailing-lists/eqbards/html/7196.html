<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784608747">Last night in Sol B I attempted to charm a GK shamen pet and got a new <br/>
message: This NPC can not pet charmed.  It would seem that NPC pet&#39;s are no <br/>
longer charmable.  I would have no problem with this if the NPC Pet died <br/>
when the owner did.<br/>
<br/>
I know in the past people have used the charm song to break PC&#39;s out of NPC <br/>
charm.  My guess is this may no longer work.<br/>
