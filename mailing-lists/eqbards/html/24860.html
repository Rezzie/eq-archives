<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146099783">Hey everyone...<br/>
Just curious how many of us would choose to sing Berserker Cressendo over Verses of Celerity while wielding weapons...and if you are using a brass horn for this, what other songs best compliment it?<br/>
My normal melee  compliment is weapons and twisting Verses of Celerity/psalm of cooling and chains (sometimes chant of flame because I like people&#39;s reactions to the %T begins to chant message).  Very curious about what other, mid 40s bards sing before getting Nivs/chords of cessation and shield of song...<br/>
Tyunes of Rodcet Nife<br/>
Finally singing the Dirge<br/>
