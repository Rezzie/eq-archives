<div id="ygrps-yiv-519979376"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have hand-to-hand up to 100 now (is it capped?  I hope not!).  The most I<br/>
&gt;remember hitting a mob of my level for is 5 points.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hrm, i was pretty sure mine capped out at 60, but it might be 100.<br/>
Regardless its not more than 100 im sure. To check a cap go to the trainer<br/>
and try to train some more points into the skill. <br/>
