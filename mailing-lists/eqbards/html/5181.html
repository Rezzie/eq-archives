I can go back to the ~ (tilde) key for my attack key.  It was close to<br/>
(1,2,3) which are my likely opening (spells-caster/juggledsongs-bard/kickbash<br/>
taunt- warrior).  I had just gotten my reflexes all trained to use it when:<br/>
smack - transparent overlays.  I remapped attack to the keypad &lt;+&gt; key (also <br/>
never likely to be used in text), but when my short chars need me to hit<br/>
&lt;PgUp&gt;<br/>
to look at tall NPC names, I often hit &lt;+&gt; instead of &lt;PgUp&gt; and end up killed<br/>
by the NPC (at least I get to see his/her name as they hit me and I die) :P.<br/>
<br/>
As one of the dextrously challenged (shush Quakeplayers, mine&#39;s even<br/>
diagnosable),<br/>
It really helps when I don&#39;t have to spend 2-3 weeks &quot;rewiring&quot; my reflexes.<br/>
