<br/>
Galtin, you deserve more congrats for changing diapers than I do for 62 days<br/>
worth of reaching level 50 ;-)  None the less, I am humbled by your kind<br/>
compliment.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

Congrats Faras.  You are truly one of the better bards on E&#39;ci.  One thing<br/>
really stuck out in your log.  Both Faras and Galtin were born on the same<br/>
day:-)  Of course he is still stuck at 39th level and will likely remain<br/>
there.  Having a newborn who requires frequent diaper changes is not<br/>
condusive to playing EQ.<br/>
