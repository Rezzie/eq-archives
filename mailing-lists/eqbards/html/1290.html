&gt;BTW has anyone noticed a faction hit message whenever something dies<br/>
&gt;around you??  I was hunting Gnolls in Highhold pass and was constantly<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have noticed this as well!  I was not in a group, and was in fact brewing<br/>
for about an hour and a half in Freeport.  I had not been playing any songs,<br/>
only leaning over the barrell crafting Fierce Brew, hadn&#39;t attacked anything<br/>
all night, and received the faction change notice several times.  People<br/>
tend to attack certain guards and even a spawning tavern NPC, but I took<br/>
absolutely no part in these nearby battles, just making brew and chatting<br/>
with drunks (I offered free beer in an auction, heheh).<br/>
