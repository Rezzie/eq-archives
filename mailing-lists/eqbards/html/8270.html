<div id="ygrps-yiv-933163604">Step number one, if you get down there and a group is camping the mob that drops the guise<br/>
(Assassin? I don&#39;t remember) is to just ask if they would mind if you looted it.  Be creative,<br/>
offer to sing them a song or something in exchange for it.<br/>
<br/>
Chances are, they&#39;re nice people who all have masks anyway and just want to pull Serrated Bone<br/>
Dirks and they&#39;ll happily let you loot the mask if you entertain them.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re jerks about it, then offer to pay.  If it was my group though, we&#39;d happily let you<br/>
loot it for free.<br/>
