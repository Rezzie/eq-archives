&gt; What I would like to see is either: 1) some of the rogue only piercing items<br/>

&gt; Am I smoking crack here thinking there aren&#39;t enough medium level piercing<br/>

when it was first implemented, and as a result there are a<br/>
huge number of them floating around.  If you look at its<br/>
damage ratio, it&#39;s a L25-35 weapon despite coming from a<br/>
L20ish mob.<br/>
<br/>
And yeah, I was miffed that they removed bards from all of the<br/>
rogue weapons.  I mean some, or even most I could understand.  <br/>
But all?<br/>
