<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Some spend their lives staring at pages<br/>
&gt; My time&#39;s better spend performing on stages<br/>
&gt; Some spend their strength swinging a sword<br/>
&gt; My strength returns with a beat or a chord<br/>
&gt; Some waste their words on pets of mystic design<br/>
&gt; My words are weapons, battle and glory are mine<br/>
&gt; Some waste their money on scales and on wings<br/>
&gt; Do they not see magic in everyone who sings?<br/>
&gt; Some say bards are weak, but do they know we are fun?<br/>
&gt; We are the jack of all trades, if the master of none<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Peace<br/>
&gt; Evulia, bard of 10 songs, Tunare<br/>
