<div id="ygrps-yiv-247673192">i think i see what you mean, that selo&#39;s drum exceeds the speed cap with<br/>
this song.  but i would think you would just hit the speed cap with it and<br/>
not go past it.  in this case when you use a selo&#39;s drum you get no speed<br/>
increase at all with this song, but do with no instrument, a normal drum, or<br/>
a mistmoore drum.<br/>
