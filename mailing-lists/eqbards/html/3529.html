<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117669581">Is it just me, or has there been a new language filter implemented in the<br/>
last few months?  I&#39;ve noticed it off an on since I got back - wasn&#39;t sure<br/>
what I was seeing until I really started watching.  Seems like most of<br/>
George Carlin&#39;s &quot;10 words&quot; are now &quot;censored&quot; by being converted to<br/>
&quot;garbage&quot; as though they were speaking a different language.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I find it hilarious, and very in character - I just assume<br/>
they&#39;re cursing in a language I don&#39;t understand.  But I wonder - if you<br/>
spam someone with cursing long enough will their skill eventually improve?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You language skills have increased. (Sailor-talk - 12)&quot;<br/>
