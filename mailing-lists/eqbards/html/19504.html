<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560128618">Well I am 30th, hasn&#39;t worked realistically for me since a patch added the<br/>
secondary resist about what, 8-9 months ago when I was 17th or 18th.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t a level thing far as I can tell.  I was trying it on mobs way below<br/>
me and got 16 successes in 83 pulses.<br/>
<br/>
On mobs that were blue to me it was even more ridiculous if that&#39;s possible.<br/>
I got 2 successes in 41 pulses.<br/>
<br/>
I only get a primary resist about 25% of the time or thereabouts.  The<br/>
secondary resist however where you fail to mesmerize happens about 75% of<br/>
the time that I don&#39;t get a primary resist.  All in all, totally and<br/>
completely useless.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to see a log file where it was working.  Are you sure you weren&#39;t<br/>
getting that secondary resist message?  I can&#39;t even get it to stick on lvl<br/>
1 mobs more than 50% of the time and haven&#39;t since lvl 20.<br/>

At what level does Kellins stop being effective? Seemed to work reasonably<br/>
well in Cazic last night at 34. I am wondering when it dies...<br/>
