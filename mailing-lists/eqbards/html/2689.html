<div id="ygrps-yiv-461724282">Has anyone figured out what the L22 song (Disenchantment)<br/>
does?  I&#39;d reported here that it *may* remove bad spell<br/>
effects.  But tonight I got hit with tashan, a DoT, and a<br/>
debuff.  I played the song and nothing happened, although the<br/>
DoT and debuff expired seconds afterwards.  The tashan stuck<br/>
around for about a minute, and playing the song didn&#39;t seem to<br/>
make a difference.<br/>
<br/>
Still inconclusive...<br/>
