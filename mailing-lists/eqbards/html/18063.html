<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045115526">Sheesh this is a quiet place considering the game is down.<br/>
 Look, I need a little reassuance and help. I remember being out of <br/>
town the first time the chance to order Kunark came up. I ordered<br/>
that <br/>
monday online but never recieved E-mail confirming. Now I read on <br/>
EQCasters (nice site) of folks calling with the same issue and being <br/>
told they &quot;can&#39;t find the order in Verant&#39;s data base, but not to <br/>
worry, you will get it&quot;. <br/>
 Gimme a hand, I am girdding for war. Wasn&#39;t the Monday after it came <br/>
out April 10th ? Or the third ? AND any of you in the same boat ?<br/>
<br/>
...crimenie, a large envelope came in the mail and I grinned ear to <br/>
ear until I opened it in the kitchen and found my wifes prescription <br/>
pills. I almost took them all in a despairing protest :)<br/>
<br/>
 Thanks<br/>
