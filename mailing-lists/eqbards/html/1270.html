<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-987024076">A friend told me about some pieces of armor that can only be worn by<br/>
rogues or bards. I believe they were called elf-hide gloves and<br/>
troll-hide belt. They each raised 2 different stats 5 points each. These<br/>
2 pieces of armor sound like a must have but I have no idea where to<br/>
find them. Anyone know?<br/>
    BTW: I prefer to use fast light weapons over minos...Once we get<br/>
dual weild it will save lots of stamina using the light weapons also<br/>
(combine scimitar and combine longsword is what I have my heart set on).<br/>
