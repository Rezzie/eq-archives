<div id="ygrps-yiv-44065208"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Because that guy is lower level than me, I should&#39;ve been able<br/>
&gt;to get the stuff before him, and when he went to camp for the<br/>
&gt;item it wouldn&#39;t have mattered to me because I&#39;d already have<br/>
&gt;the item.  Instead, he&#39;s gotten it before me, and thus dumped<br/>
&gt;the camping congestion his item caused onto me when I go to<br/>
&gt;get them.  Like I said, cutting in line.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;To use your terminology above, a line progresses at x minutes/<br/>
&gt;person.  So (given a fixed number of people) a line will<br/>
&gt;dissipate in the same amount of time no matter how the order<br/>
&gt;is shuffled.  But you can&#39;t deny that people in the middle<br/>
&gt;have a legitimate gripe if someone in front gives their<br/>
&gt;friends (secondary characters) in back a cut to the front.<br/>
&gt;Calling them jealous because someone behind them got to go to<br/>
&gt;the front is just plain stupid.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The way I see it, if the primary character gives an item or two to his<br/>
secondary character (without camping explicitly to give it to the second<br/>
character) this would have no effect on &quot;the line&quot; what so ever.  YThe<br/>
line&#39;s length, as well as your position in it, remain unchanged.  If<br/>
anything it eliminates an otherwise competitive entity from the line.</div>
