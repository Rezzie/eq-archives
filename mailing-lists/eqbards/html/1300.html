&gt; Now I am lvl 14, and was looking forward to purchasing Lullaby. So i had a <br/>
&gt; friend gate me to G Faydark just for this song, and found that the merchant <br/>
&gt; selling high level songs has neither one now. I also heard that maybe one of <br/>
&gt; the merchants was missing. Maybe he went for a walk (I&#39;ve seen that before, <br/>

merchants for the L18 song before realizing I&#39;d have to go to<br/>
Freeport for it).  What&#39;s likely is that the merchant moved or<br/>
was on the roof.  I think that happens when someone accidently<br/>
attacks the merchant and runs away (which for a bard can be<br/>
rather far).  /petition a GM saying that a guild merchant is<br/>
missing.<br/>

There should be two merchants in the back room in Kelethin.<br/>
