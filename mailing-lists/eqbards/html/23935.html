<div id="ygrps-yiv-2082445329">I am finsihing up the easy part of the Bard Epic, and ran into a problem.  I went to find the guy in W Karana who turns into a Doppelganger (Miraz or something).  I found his little band of merry men, and as I approached, they agroed on me.  <br/>
<br/>
Do I have to charm him to give him the note?<br/>
<br/>
DO I have to kill off all his lackey&#39;s first?<br/>
<br/>
In any case, do oyu think a group (6) of 50-54 will have any problem taking them out?<br/>
<br/>
Elfson Allegro 51(doh, raided again last night so still haven&#39;t pushed out that last smidge to 52) Veeshan<br/>
<br/>
PS.  I don&#39;t know whY i am bothering to do this since I don&#39;t think I will ever be able to finish the quest since I depend on other guilds to take me on dragon raids, thus I will never get the components...  Guess I can say I am half done my Epic Quest :-)<br/>
