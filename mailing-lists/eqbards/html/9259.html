<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054210337"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; ...  I think there are five spawn points on the first level ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Six, actually.  Also, two on the ramp, four in the warrior room, three in the <br/>
raider room.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ...Is the spawn rate faster<br/>
&gt; further down in the basement?  Are there more things to fight in the basement<br/>
&gt; than on the first level?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, they&#39;re not faster.  No, there is nothing more downstairs except tougher <br/>
picklaws.  It&#39;s good but boring exp.  Great for doing laundry, reading a good book, <br/>
etc..  Particularly good if you like chatting to other players.  I&#39;ve met a lot of <br/>
different players this way and had a chance to actually get to know them somewhat. <br/>
I have some expectation that this will help me find some groups more easily when I <br/>
leave.<br/>
