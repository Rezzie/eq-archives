<div id="ygrps-yiv-500567193">Charm is an extremly powerful ability.  Our charm can be very overbalancing<br/>
since mobs hit so damn hard at high levels and we have the ability to<br/>
recharm while getting the crap beat out of us.  Be happy they gave us the<br/>
new charm :-)  It&#39;s sad that I am pretty retiring the song at this point<br/>
(too many mobs too high lvl now), but I really can understand why the<br/>
limited us...<br/>
