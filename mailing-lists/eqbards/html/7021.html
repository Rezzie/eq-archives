<div id="ygrps-yiv-719373438"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;All of the other zones in the world are usually only 2, sometimes 3, zones<br/>
 </span></blockquote>away from a bind point. Is it just that folks aren&#39;t aware what the<br/>
bind-able zones are? Or maybe good aligned characters don&#39;t realize they can<br/>
be bound in evil cities just like good cities? Is a two zone run THAT bad?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Uhhhh, yeeees, theory says I can be bound in say Ogguk or grobb, but<br/>
practice says if I die in cazic it is<br/>
<br/>
Arena-&gt;Lake Rathtear-&gt;Rathe Mountains-&gt;Feerot-&gt;Cazic<br/>
or<br/>
SFreeport-&gt;N-ro-&gt;Oasis-&gt;S-ro-&gt;Innothule-&gt;feerot-&gt;cazic<br/>
<br/>
(btw, SolB has a direct zone to Lavastorm)<br/>
<br/>
Then again I am not worried about it, I am a bard! I mostly just stay bound<br/>
in Highpass and deal with it. Zoooooom.<br/>
