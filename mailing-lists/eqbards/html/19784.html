<div id="ygrps-yiv-598666961">eqlizer may get fake pics, but they are much better about verification and<br/>
weeding them out before they get posted, as well as removing fake ones that<br/>
do get through and posting an explanation.<br/>

&gt; bound to happen.  Nobody has time to verify all of the images <br/>
&gt; that get sent<br/>
&gt; in and some are bound to slip through.  Don;t know how long <br/>
&gt; that image was<br/>
&gt; there but when I went in this morning there was no link to it <br/>
