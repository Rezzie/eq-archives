<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021103119"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Hey, you forgot one of my favorites:  Instill Doubt.  Not that it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;useful or anything, but it amuses the party in those boring down moments.<br/>
&gt;(The &quot;you&#39;re not scaring anybody&quot; message still cracks me up.)  I also<br/>
&gt;have fishing close to maxed, and begging at nearly 70.  With fishing I<br/>
&gt;can yank in a fish almost every cast now (which replenishes a low food<br/>
&gt;supply quite quickly).  Begging, on the other hand, stinks.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
&gt;managed to get more than a silver.  But, by Mithaniel Marr, I&#39;m gonna max<br/>
&gt;it just to see if it ever gets better!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Acutally ID is usefull when you are Fear/Chaining, as it gives an extra fear <br/>
chance which never hurts.  In the last two nights I have raised my ID 14 pts <br/>
to 57, long boring camp for a Guise.  I know have a base charisma of 141 :)<br/>
