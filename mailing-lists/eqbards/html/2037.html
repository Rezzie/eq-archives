<div id="ygrps-yiv-209305338">So far I have recieved character primary stats from only eight people.  This<br/>
is still not enough responses to generate a valid sample. There are over 300<br/>
people subscribed to this list.  I&#39;m shooting for at least 30 responses<br/>
before I publish the results.      Request that anyone who has not sent me<br/>
their characters stats to please do so. I also need to know what race you<br/>
are.   Once I get enough data, I will post the &quot;average&quot; bard stats, both<br/>
combined and by race.  <br/>
