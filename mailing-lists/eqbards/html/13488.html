<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520367459">Hehe - they did not forget you!  They doubled the spawn time in your (mine<br/>
too) zones!  Yup yup, rumor mill says 80 minute respawn in Sol-B and<br/>
Lower-G.  <br/>
<br/>
Nothing for mids?  Kithicor and NewPaw?  Too hard for mids.  Risk/Reward not<br/>
there.  Ya, ya, I know. <br/>

Verant has a distinct knack for missing the mark at times.  <br/>

Rant on: <br/>
I have no problems with Verant adding more stuff for the 46+ players to do.<br/>
That gets them out of the zone where I&#39;m at.  What I do have a concern with<br/>
is the apparent lack of attention given to players less than 46th level.</div>
