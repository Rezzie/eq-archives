<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-371540345">This was disabled by verant.  Some people figured out how to engage<br/>
&#39;Cheater&#39; programs, and how to edit files to allow them capabilities not<br/>
normally granted (lvl 1 caster with spells effects of a lvl 49 spell.<br/>
....  Running 200 times faster than the fastest Bard, etc) ..  This is<br/>
the reason for the speed cap.<br/>
<br/>
The key strokes will now disable the EQ connection...<br/>
I used it to research the web, but the strokes WERE....<br/>
Ctrl+Alt+Del ...  Choose &#39;Cancel&#39;  (You&#39;re in the desktop now)<br/>
Do whatever you need to do...<br/>
Click on the EQ tas in the task bar.<br/>
<br/>
If you did this, your desktop mouse cursor would remain visable, but you<br/>
were unable to move it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
