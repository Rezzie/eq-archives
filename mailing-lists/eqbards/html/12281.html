<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289394330">i remember that.  tho having a bard in your group pumping up everyone&#39;s MR<br/>
helped immensely from what i remember.  lots of charm resists.  also<br/>
remember having it take forever to START a 6 person group in there.  we&#39;d be<br/>
the only group in the zone.  oh well the good ole days.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; The change in popularity happened when charm was taken away <br/>
&gt; from pc and<br/>
&gt; npc shaman. Before that, Sol B as very deadly, even more so than Lower<br/>
&gt; Guk. Before that, on our server, if you went there it was <br/>
&gt; only a matter<br/>
&gt; of time before your tanks got charmed and a chunk of your party was<br/>
&gt; wiped out. Removing charm from them made the dungeon majorly <br/>
&gt; easier than<br/>
&gt; it was before and once that happened it became popular fast. </span></blockquote></div>
