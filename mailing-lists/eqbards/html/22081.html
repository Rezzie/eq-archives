<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well we try to recruit a lot of new people. If I see a friend without a guildtag<br/>
I will ask him (Just ask windleaf) if she/he is interested. I dident do that<br/>
with Guardians of the Divine Light, but today I feel it is an absolutly must do<br/>
thing - if not we will never get any new members. From time to time small<br/>
disputs arise, but most oftenly they crumble into nothing and people remember<br/>
whats its all about namely FUN. We do have one small problem which arise from<br/>
time to time. We dont accept any evil races or classes - I hope this will change<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that helps us is that a major part of our members are europeans<br/>
which is an advantage since only one other (AFIK) EU guild exist on Bertox<br/>
(Charmed alliance) and we are working together with them.<br/>
