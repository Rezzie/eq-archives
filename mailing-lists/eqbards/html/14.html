<div id="ygrps-yiv-424898330">Greetings, Bards of Norrath!<br/>
<br/>
I am glad to see that someone has taken the initiative to keep<br/>
communication open among all the bards.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I would use this opportunity to remind all of you that I have<br/>
indeed founded a guild for bards called The Soerbaird, and we are over<br/>
thirty members strong, and growing still!<br/>
<br/>
We are dedicated to writing, composing, and performing in Norrath, as well<br/>
as many othet tasks of communication and diplomacy. If you&#39;re interested in<br/>
such a group, please visit our annals at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.soerbaird.com">http://www.soerbaird.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Listen and Live!<br/>
<br/>
