<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318933619"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Does anyone have info on this horn, i.e. where to obtain it, is it a quest<br/>
&gt;item or reward, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I submitted that instrument, it is the rare drop on the Unicorn in lesser<br/>
fay. Friend of mine gave it to me the other day (I had killed the unicorn 4<br/>
times and not gotten it).<br/>
