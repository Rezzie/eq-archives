<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677313317">Well I haven&#39;t seen a wood elf wearing a plate/bronze helm yet so can&#39;t<br/>
comment on it, but something that does look funny is my wood elf bard<br/>
wearing a ringmail coif.  He looks like a cross between a Vulcan and a<br/>
Ferengi.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; WARNING.  bronze and plate look exactly the same except for color.  the<br/>
&gt; helms on wood elf males and females are hidious.  i wear a fine silk<br/>
&gt; turbin<br/>
&gt; off the sand giant Hatar, looks like cloth so doesn&#39;t show on body.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m saving up now to convert my small bronze helmet into a small steel <br/>
&gt; helmet.  I just hope it&#39;s not as ugly as the bronze one!  Every other race<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; that I&#39;ve seen gets really cool looking bronze helmets.  The wood elf <br/>
&gt; version, according to my guildmates, makes me look like a push-pin.<br/>
