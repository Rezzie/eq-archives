<div id="ygrps-yiv-278168438"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Why would you be disgusted?  What is the big deal?  So dude got sick of EQ<br/>
&gt;and wants to sell off his hard work.  So what?  It&#39;s not like he is selling <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt;child.  Lest I remind you, and I fear I must, this is a &quot;game&quot;.  It might<br/>
&gt;seem real to you but it isn&#39;t.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps he, like me, is disgusted with anyone who would choose the &quot;lazy <br/>
way&quot; of buying a character rather than creating your own. Also, perhaps he <br/>
(like me) believes the EQ bards to be a higher class of player than the <br/>
average &quot;kewl dood&quot; that buys/sells their characters.<br/>
Just my opinion, and I believe one that is shared by many.<br/>
