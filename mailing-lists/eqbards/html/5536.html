		situation like that. When I died in the Ogre camp<br/>
		I asked for help of higher level characters and told<br/>
		them what I needed help with so that they knew before<br/>
		even answering. Even when I found one willing to help,<br/>
		they backed out when he saw just how many Ogre&#39;s were<br/>
		there. I thanked him and let him go. No use making <br/>
		him die too.</div>
