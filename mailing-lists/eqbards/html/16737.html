&gt; No its not that I want to complain that now they can chain cast buffs.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; more irritated in that I think there are things far more &#39;broken&#39; for other<br/>
&gt; classes and that they should spend their time on finding way to tweak the<br/>
&gt; non-purecasting classes to make them better as they are already behind.  Why<br/>
&gt; on earth would Necros need any enhancement whatsoever at this point???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like it or not, the game is now largely composed of casters, so I guess<br/>
they will be getting the most attention. It&#39;s a catch 22 really. Just<br/>
like rogues will never get &quot;fixed&quot; because hardly anyone plays them.<br/>
