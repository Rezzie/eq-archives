dervishes, etc... all very tough, and some can only be harmed by<br/>
magic/magic weapons. However, I&#39;ve heard tell that many creatures carry<br/>
gems with them. There is also a camp in that area that sells the much<br/>
sought-after combine weapons.<br/>

Connected to Lavastorm is Najena.... also very tough, but containing<br/>
good loot for a change. This dungeon is crawling with the undead, so be<br/>
sure to bring a handy Cleric with you!<br/>
