<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425612439">Well met fellow bards a few things for the records.<br/>
<br/>
1.  We have over 300 members on this list, more then all of the other everquest bard lists combined.<br/>
<br/>
2.  I have sent messages to the other 4 mailing list moderators to try to get them to join their lists with ours.<br/>
<br/>
3.  The next issue of the newsletter is comming out soon and I still need some submissions please send them to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:lol@...">lol@...</a> thanks.<br/>
<br/>
4.  Some people have been complaining about getting up to 100 messages a day, sorry about this but its a good thing as we have been called the most intelligent EQ list on the onelist servers, so here a few ideas to try...<br/>
<br/>
Set eqbards to send you the digest instead of every email idividually.<br/>
<br/>
Set your email program to filter all eqbards messages to thier own folder.<br/>
<br/>
Create a free email account such as yahoo or hotmail, just for your eqbards messages.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you all and keep up the wonderfull work helping each other.<br/>
<br/>
See you online<br/>
