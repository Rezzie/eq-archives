<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-663745781">OK, just got out of 30 hell.. bound in FV, been hunting in OT with <br/>
groups.  Training up my brass (excellent, finally) on the docks at night <br/>
when finished adventuring....<br/>
<br/>
Now, I am a pretty kicking battle bard in a group.  Fighting and twisting <br/>
Im good at , have been gifted some good gear, armor and weapons ... good <br/>
enough at least.  Have been gifted MM drums, SS boots and Gauntlet....  so <br/>
I do just fine.<br/>
<br/>
But, am weak on crowd control (no cha gear yet) and kiting.  Very weak on <br/>
kiting...<br/>
<br/>
I know I need to train kiting and will be doing that.<br/>
<br/>
Gear wise, I&#39;m thinking about starting to try for lambent stuff.  Read a <br/>
guide about being a low level and sneaking around and asking for no drops <br/>
from high levels to get the gear, and considering that.<br/>
<br/>
I feel a high priority for me is a dark elf mask as well.  Has good cha <br/>
(13) and dark elf should not be KOS with guards in OT...<br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t have good instruments other than drums.  Have a minotaur horn for <br/>
wind, but no special lutes.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions, itemwise?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
