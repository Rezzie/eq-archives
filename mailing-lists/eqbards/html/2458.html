&gt; Hi, I just hit 20th level on E&#39;ci, and I had heard mention in previous<br/>
&gt; threads that the (2*dmg)+1 damage formulae only applies until level 20. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is not entirely true.  I _believe_ the attack modifier for your<br/>
weapon is acutally something like:<br/>
<br/>
dmg * max( (skill in weapon + STR)/100 , 2)<br/>
<br/>
That is, at low levels your modifier is 2 (rounded up, which would<br/>
give the common &#39;+1&#39; part).<br/>
<br/>
Once your skill in that weapon plus your STR passes 200, you start<br/>
to hit harder.<br/>
<br/>
Thus my other character (ogre on Zek) with base STR of 130 should<br/>
start to hit harder about L 13 or so.<br/>
<br/>
And as a by-product of this, if your STR is over 100 you will see<br/>
this effect sooner than Level 20, where most would start to see its<br/>
effects.<br/>
<br/>
As for modifiers for STR over 100, I can&#39;t comment on this.<br/>
