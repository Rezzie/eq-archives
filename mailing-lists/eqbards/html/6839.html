<div id="ygrps-yiv-959441849">I too have just reached 27th over the weekend and began experimenting with<br/>
Charm.  I would also like a to request a repost of the techniques and usages<br/>
best found for this song, what pet commands work best, etc.  I found it very<br/>
difficult to use considering it has varying lengths of duration &lt;10 seconds.<br/>
This is obviously very tricky to use and was meant to be that way for us, I<br/>
know we have had this thread a few times already but a recap would be<br/>
greatly appreciated.<br/>
