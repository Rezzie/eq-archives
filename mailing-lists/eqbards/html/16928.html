No.  what I try to do is slap on accelerondo and<br/>
circle the battle.  I stay within spell range, avoid<br/>
the mobs and keep my party a little faster on their<br/>
feet. If things go well I can bellow for some minor<br/>
damage. Little trick from playing quake2.<br/>
<br/>
Personally though, I&#39;ve found it pretty tough for a<br/>
14th lvl bard to root or stun three dervishes at once.<br/>
If you&#39;re going to tell me the party should do that,<br/>
please go back and read my initial words: &quot;If I had a<br/>
dollar for every time I waited...&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
