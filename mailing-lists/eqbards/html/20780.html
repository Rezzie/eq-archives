<div id="ygrps-yiv-520206794">Well, over the weekend, I finally hit 38 *AND* finished my Nostrolo Tamborine quest :o)  Groouping with a 45 druid guildbro at the FV giants, I switched tactics from the old &quot;play mansong while he roots and DoTs til the giant is almost dead, then get in and melee it down (since he is usally lom anyway)&quot;, to the new and imrpoved &quot;manasong and chants with drum equipped&quot;.  Heh!  The druid was amazed that over the long run, when the giant broke root, it would come straight for me instead of him.  <br/>
