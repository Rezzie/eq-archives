<div id="ygrps-yiv-957162459"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Not sure of this fellas history of complaining, but I<br/>
&gt; think he has a legitimate beef in this instance.  Hey,<br/>
&gt; if it keeps one idiot from doing this stuff, it&#39;s fine<br/>
&gt; by me.  If you are sick of him complaining--Don&#39;t read<br/>
&gt; his posts.  It&#39;s as simple as that.  Yesterday, I had<br/>
&gt; some idiot running sand giants fairly close to me too.<br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s really quite a distraction when you are trying<br/>
&gt; to fight something and you see a sand giant running<br/>
&gt; straight at you.    <br/>

 </span></blockquote>  If it was somebody on this list, then a private e-mail<br/>
  could have been sent.  And I apologize for sending my<br/>
  post to the list, as it was in the same fashion.  People<br/>
  kiting mobs around inconsiderately isn&#39;t really a bard topic.  <br/>
  The person who complained about it, was trying to make a <br/>
  point to the bard on this list in public, which in itself was <br/>
  wrong.  That was my issue.<br/>
