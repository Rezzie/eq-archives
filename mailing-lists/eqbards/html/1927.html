<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318097642">Last week I sent out a request to everyone on the list to send me<br/>
information on their bard character.  I requested everyone send me a list of<br/>
their primary stats so I could determine what the average stats were for<br/>
bard characters.  Also need to know what your race is so I can differentiate<br/>
the average stats between the three races.  So far the number of responses I<br/>
have received has been less than encouraging.  <br/>
<br/>
Unless a majority of you are opposed to using this forum for this type of<br/>
research, I will continue to periodically post this request until I get<br/>
enough responses to generate some valid results.  If you are opposed to me<br/>
using this list for this type of  research, send me a private email.  Also,<br/>
if you send me your character&#39;s stats, be sure to send them via private<br/>
email as well. <br/>
