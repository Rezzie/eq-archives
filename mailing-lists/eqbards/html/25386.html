Save 4 Ulthork tusks and hand them to the right otter and he will give you a<br/>
nice prize (random good gem: diamond, blue diamond, sapphire, jacinth) - be<br/>
careful, the way the npc&#39;s are positioned, it is a common mistake to hand<br/>
your 4 tusks to the wrong otter even though you are standing right in front<br/>
of and talking to the correct one.<br/>

Yes, Cobalt Scars otters are on a stand alone faction. Everyone starts out<br/>
indifferent and moves from there. I don&#39;t know of anyway to improve faction<br/>
with them.</div>
