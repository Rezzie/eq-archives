<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157915320">ok, you replied to my statement that i use SoT to interrupt casters rather<br/>

&gt; fighting melee giants, there&#39;s usually<br/>
&gt; enough room in my list (at 57) to toss this song in.  I just <br/>
&gt; use it for a little extra damage every five<br/>
&gt; minutes.<br/>
