<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860744068">I have yet to have the opportunity to attend a concert in Norrath so my<br/>
question is about performance mechanics.<br/>
<br/>
I assume there is no way to provide actual music.  Let your imagination a<br/>
bit loose and consider that perhaps someday Verant will let us feed in a<br/>
MIDI or .wav file that then goes to the listeners.  The bandwidth needed<br/>
for a MIDI might even be within reason.<br/>
<br/>
So I further assume that you simply supply the words for all those nearby<br/>
to read.  Is there a way to do that in reasonable quantity without having<br/>
to type them as you go?  Do you perhaps set up chunks of the words as<br/>
command macros, then touch those off one at a time in order?<br/>
