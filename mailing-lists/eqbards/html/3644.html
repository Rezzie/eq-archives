<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-740113761">One thing that I find, that I assume is related to twinking,  is low level<br/>
characters, begging for money or Items.  Probably because their previous<br/>
character was twinked by some high level char and they didn&#39;t have to work<br/>
hard to get up in the world.  And then they either moved servers, or deleted<br/>
their previous char and no one has come and thrown 100plat their way.<br/>
anyone else notice this begging?<br/>
