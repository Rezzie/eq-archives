&gt; As of yet I have seen absolutely no effect with the Lute of the Gypsy<br/>
&gt; Princess over a regular lute, save that it could sell to the vendor for<br/>
&gt; 4.5 pp. However, it may take a higher level for it to be effective (much<br/>
&gt; like the proc on a Screaming Mace not working for low level characters),<br/>
&gt; or perhaps it only works for songs like Lament? That can be rather<br/>
&gt; difficult to check. We&#39;ll have to get John one so he can check though,<br/>
&gt; his tests are always alot more detailed then anything I do. =)<br/>

out and found absolutely no effect.<br/>

This is probably a bug though.  I would hold on to any gypsy lutes you find.<br/>
