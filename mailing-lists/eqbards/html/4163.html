<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460160139">I have a Dragoon dirk (6/23) and a pugius (5/21) theory says that I should<br/>
put the pugius as my main weapon but it&#39;s ratio is lower than the dragoon<br/>
dirk. So, over time, wouldn&#39;t I be doing more damage (at level 17) by having<br/>
the Dragoon dirk as my primary?<br/>
