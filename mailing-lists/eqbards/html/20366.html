&gt;How did you get this to your del key?  I know how to remap keys - I<br/>
&gt;actually have remapped all my movement keys, reply, tells, etc. to<br/>
&gt;my left hand normal typing home position leaving the right hand for<br/>
&gt;the mouse.  But, each of those remappings were specifically available<br/>
&gt;in the keyboard options.  Did you somehow get /target pet to your<br/>
&gt;user defined keys?  Then assign that user defined key to del? (and is<br/>
&gt;the command /target pet or /pet target?)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess my real question is how to use the user defined key.  How do<br/>
&gt;you define the action and then assign to a key stroke?<br/>

default is f1, can be pressed twice. The first time targets yourself, the <br/>
second time targets your pet.<br/>
