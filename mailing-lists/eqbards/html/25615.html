I hate to report this, but there does indeed seem to be a problem with some <br/>
bard songs. We&#39;re working on fixing that right now.<br/>
But just so you know, the casting timer is intentional (and not the problem <br/>
with the spells). It just seemed to make sense to give bards the same <br/>
information about their casting (singing) as other casters.<br/>
