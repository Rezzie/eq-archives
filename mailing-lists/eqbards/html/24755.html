<b>Subject:</b> Level for Vox raid? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809966799">Hi all,<br/>
I hit 42nd lvl last week and am looking for a serious raiding guild on Rodcet Nife.  I recently posted to one guild&#39;s website and got an answer back that bards must be 45th lvl in order to be effective on a Vox raid.<br/>
Is this correct?  Please let me know<br/>
