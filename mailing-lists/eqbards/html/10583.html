<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896149342">This e-mail isn&#39;t about EQ, its about a v´┐¢rus that infected a computer at<br/>
my work. It only appears when Microsoft Word is running, it says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Twenty-two points, plus triple-word-score, plus fifty points for using all<br/>
 my letters. Game&#39;s over. I&#39;m outta here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If any of you know anything about this virus, plz let me know.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
