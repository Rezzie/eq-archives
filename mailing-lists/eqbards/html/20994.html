<div id="ygrps-yiv-1553322024">I finally went back to exact my revenge on the Mino Hero at level 45, I<br/>
figured I was finally ready at this point considering that he is I think<br/>
level 35.  I fear kited him and beat him down with melee weapons, 5 minutes<br/>
later when the battle was finally over I triumphantly looted the shackles<br/>
with a little under 2 bubbles of health left. That was one TOUGH fight and<br/>
it illustrated to me how overpowered the mobs in this game tend to be...I<br/>
barely survived against a mob 10 levels lower than me!  I rarely solo<br/>
though, so it felt really good to take him out alone.<br/>
<br/>
The Hero is camped almost all the time in E&#39;ci, Steamfont is pretty safe<br/>
nowadays.<br/>
