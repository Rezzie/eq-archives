<div id="ygrps-yiv-572216732">Hail friends,<br/>
<br/>
As simple question I cannot figure out for the life of me:<br/>
<br/>
How do you know how much damage your Chords of Dissonance dishes<br/>
out? When I hit a critter with it, I only get the message that he<br/>
&quot;winces&quot;. Now, I know I&#39;m hitting pretty good at lev 17 using<br/>
a mandolin because I&#39;ve tried only using the chord and not attacking<br/>
and the crit&#39;s life bar goes down at a good rate. But frankly,<br/>
I&#39;d like to know exactly how much damage I&#39;m putting to him<br/>
so I can measure its use against Bellow.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any info. you can pass along.<br/>
<br/>
Yours in Song,<br/>
