<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998383589">last time i checked, mellifluous motion doesn&#39;t get you out of those<br/>
situations anymore.  at least a few weeks ago, it did not get me out of a<br/>
gate in kedge or in perma.  and by the way, that gm not helping is quite<br/>
ludicrous.<br/>

&gt; Remember that corpse situation in Lava.  Well, same thing <br/>
&gt; happened to a<br/>
&gt; friend of mine.  We were in Paw getting some snakeskin gloves <br/>
&gt; for me, I was<br/>
&gt; only 15th at the time and he was 22nd.  Well, we got the <br/>
&gt; gloves and were<br/>
&gt; headed out when my buddy got caught in one of the gates. </span></blockquote></div>
