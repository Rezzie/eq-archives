one that usually knows where we&#39;re going : )    Invis&#39; range is soooo small<br/>
it&#39;s frustrating.  Definately not a travel song.  I just finally made it to<br/>
Erudin to buy the missing songs out of my songbook.  I also bought ahead, so<br/>
I&#39;m good until level 33 or so. :  )<br/>

I was just bestowed with my sir name last night, in time to lose the level<br/>
tonite in Permafrost.  : )<br/>
