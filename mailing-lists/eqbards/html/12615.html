<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009621071">That happened to me all the time when I am cutting it close (for me<br/>
usually means Warsong, Bellow, Bellow).  However the icon stays on my<br/>
screen, and I think my str stays up (its hard to tell normally since I<br/>
have a BS Mantle and str buffs)<br/>
I hope it stays up anyway<br/>
