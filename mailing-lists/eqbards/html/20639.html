<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478391121">i would try to get the tanks to spread out damage among them and use vov, nivs, hymn.<br/>
on paper the enchanters hastes are better, but in real life, any speed up song/spell with any<br/>
haste item gets you to max haste.  so he can save his mana for other stuff.    you could<br/>
also pull multiples and use charm.  we break the king room in lower guk by pulling 2 and 3<br/>
at a time, just cuz it&#39;s quicker.</div>
