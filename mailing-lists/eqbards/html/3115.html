<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989169521">Has anyone else been doing the mail delivery quest?  When I deliver mail from <br/>
Kelethin to Freeport it doesn&#39;t work, but going the other way (Freeport to <br/>
Kelethin) it works fine.  Here is what I am doing.  Idia in Kelethin gives me <br/>
a mail pouch and tells me to take it to Felisity Starbright in Freeport.  I do <br/>
that, but nothing happens.  Is this a bug?  Does it happen to everyone, or <br/>
just me?  Am I doing something wrong?<br/>
