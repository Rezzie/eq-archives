&gt;I have _never_ seen MM Drums go for less than 1000 pp on Veeshan, Rallos or<br/>
&gt;Tallon.<br/>

seen two of them at that price on Povar, however my statistical sampling has<br/>
only three data points so it could have been a fluke I only saw those. The<br/>
third (mine)  skews it quite the other way, I traded a Serpentine Bracer for<br/>
mine...yup 350pp on a good day.<br/>

So, you milage may vary wildly.<br/>
