<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366673062"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Go for the Double Bladed Bone Axe 18/48 2hs, dropped in S Karana by Synger<br/>
&gt; Foxfyre and looks like the exec axe when wielded.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Someone tried to sell me this 5 months ago or so.  I thought it was<br/>
  a hoax at the time.  But decided not to buy it, because Verant had<br/>
  this strange way of just changing things back then.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ll try to look up the blade again.  Thanks for the tip.<br/>
