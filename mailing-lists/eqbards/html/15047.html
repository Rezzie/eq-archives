&gt; Yup, unless you started off at full mana, in which case you<br/>
&gt; automatically get the extra mana (at least, no white appeared<br/>
&gt; when I played Elegy at FM, whereas the white increased when<br/>
&gt; I played Elegy at less than FM).<br/>

on.  If this is really how it works, then once everyone is FM,<br/>
if you play Elegy, you&#39;ve essentially just given them free<br/>
mana.<br/>
