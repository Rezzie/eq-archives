<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900947945">You&#39;re right.  I guess I am.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t leave my pc hooked up 24/7, but I just read on the Black Ice site<br/>
that a quarter of all DSL users have their pc&#39;s probed while they&#39;re online.<br/>

Thanks for the tip, Rokenn.  Any advice on settings to allow EQ to run?<br/>
