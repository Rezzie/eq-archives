<b>Subject:</b> Selo&#39;s and root <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937576133">Although Selo&#39;s does not break root anymore I thought<br/>
we had determined that it would on the next pulse if<br/>
you were playing it before being rooted.  Well, last<br/>
night in Mistmoore this did not appear to be the case.<br/>
 I was running around when I was rooted by<br/>
something--maybe dark offerer or whatever.  Anyway<br/>
Selo&#39;s was on and did NOT break root.  It is possible<br/>
that I got rooted and stunned which killed my song<br/>
before the next pulse.  I got out of the root and was<br/>
blasted about 2 jumps from the zone. Arghhh.  Anyway,<br/>
can anyone verify the root thing?  I&#39;ll try to<br/>
experiment with a rooter tonight.<br/>
