<div id="ygrps-yiv-276324285">Having just obtained the 20th song for a bard I am getting that wonder lust<br/>
feeling again. I have<br/>
explored all of the Karana&#39;s and they have been good to me but alas it is<br/>
time to move on.<br/>
<br/>
I hear in a far off land of a place called the Estate of Unrest. Sounds<br/>
delightful. I am particular<br/>
interested in aquiring the fabled Opalline Earings. Can anyone give<br/>
information on who I need to<br/>
&quot;persuade&quot; in to letting me have a pair?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all<br/>
