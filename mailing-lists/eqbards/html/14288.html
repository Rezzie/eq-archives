<div id="ygrps-yiv-254477354"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Unfortunately in terms of even cons it effectively is unlimited.  Even green<br/>
&gt; no xp bandit wizard casters will kill a single PC many levels after he stops<br/>
&gt; getting xp for them.  If the song cut their mana by 10% per pulse it might<br/>
&gt; matter, but otherwise its pretty much a waste.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  You are correct, I failed the mention the casters that are 20 levels<br/>
  below me who could kill me over and over again with the mana they had.<br/>
<br/>
  I forgot all about that, sorry Kit ;)<br/>
