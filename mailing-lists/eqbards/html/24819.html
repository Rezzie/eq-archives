<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596629158">Want some opinions on this.  Do you think it really works?  Can 3 enchanters<br/>
keep her from CH&#39;ing herself?  I have not been on many vox raids, 2 to be<br/>
exact, but she never CH when I was there I used the Rod from phini (mana<br/>
sieve) and with 2 enchanters one time and 4 the next she never ch&#39;d on the<br/>
two raids I have went to.  I have heard people say that this does not work<br/>
and have heard the opposite.  My 2 vox raids are surely not enough to prove<br/>
anything at all, so what do you all think?<br/>
