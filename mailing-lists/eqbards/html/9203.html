<div id="ygrps-yiv-562823842">Actually there&#39;s a bug in the way it works : if you are CURRENTLY typing <br/>
when charmed (ie. you already pressed the enter key) you can go on typing <br/>
while charmed.<br/>
I think that if you&#39;re not you can&#39;t. Works the same way when you fall <br/>
unconscious I guess.<br/>
