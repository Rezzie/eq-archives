<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-268022851">I am about to gain the ability to cast Chains &lt; crosses fingers &gt; and was<br/>
wondering how reliable it is when you first get it.  I was hoping to be able<br/>
to add a lot of areas I&#39;ve been avoiding to my hunting list, but am not<br/>
certain if Chains will be able to serve as a makeshift snare well enough to<br/>
be safe.  What do you guys think?  I&#39;ve been avoiding anything with runners<br/>
without someone to snare, would Chains allow me and a magician to safely do<br/>
Fire goblins or do we need more snaring/rooting power?  We were hoping to<br/>
team up there but only myself, a magician, and our monk can make it.  Any<br/>
suggestions?<br/>
