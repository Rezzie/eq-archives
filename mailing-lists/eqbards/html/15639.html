<div id="ygrps-yiv-230231979">I am on CT and I have just made 15th level. (yea!) I have been hunting in<br/>
Steamfont, outside of the Mino caves and doing very well with experience. I<br/>
was gaining an average of 1 bubble every 1.5 hours. I did this solo from<br/>
level 12 -15. Is there another place like this that I can go to? Also when<br/>
should I start doing any Bard specific quests?<br/>
