Bottom line is that selling the equipment is not illegal (violation of any<br/>
statute or penal code) AND Verant doesn&#39;t give a shit one way or the other<br/>
if it&#39;s sold, they just don&#39;t want to become party to any legal action<br/>
involved with the sale and/or transfer of equipment or characters.<br/>
<br/>
So why are we talking about this??????????</div>
