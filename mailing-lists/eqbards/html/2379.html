<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891674243">A simple solution to this would be an auto-mapping function (stored on the pc with hotkey and /friend info) that maps everything within your range of site in the zone (similar to the strategy game Command & Conquer).  It works better than /loc and has more RP value (what adventuerer worth their salt wouldn&#39;t map a new area?)<br/>
