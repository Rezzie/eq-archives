<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962708664">I&#39;ve seen this problem for about a week or so.  Other people I&#39;ve grouped<br/>
with have said they have seen this problem before - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s<br/>
strictly bard or bard-grouping related.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the repeat switching works for me - but I&#39;ll give it a try...<br/>

I noticed this too, this morning.  Something must have happened overnight,<br/>
because everything was fine when I was playing last night.<br/>
<br/>
I found that switching back and forth a couple of times brought the history<br/>
back.</div>
