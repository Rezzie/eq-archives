<div id="ygrps-yiv-274589983">I dueled a level 17 wizard using this technique and it just plain didn&#39;t<br/>
work!  Granted, I was in an ingredible laggy zone, was experiencing a great<br/>
amount of packet loss, and the wizard was running around, slippery little<br/>
bugger (half the time I&#39;d see him standing one place when in reality my<br/>
client was wrong and he was somewhere else).  But still, embarassing to be<br/>
bested by one a few levels bellow me.  I&#39;d never use Lullaby for this<br/>
purpose again, I didn&#39;t see him interupted once when I reviewed the text.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Lullaby would be more useful for this purpose with a shorter period<br/>
between pulses.  Come to think of it, Mellifluos Motion might actually serve<br/>
some kind of purpose if it had a shorter pulse.<br/>
