<div id="ygrps-yiv-1363483590">Well twinkie bardette had a good weekend!  I am finally a mana-battery!<br/>
*cheers*<br/>
<br/>
Also got her an erudite mask and thank god its a good face cuz Tani&#39;s guise<br/>
gives her the ugliest DE face (Hally has the second ugliest!) so I&#39;m glad I<br/>
got a good one for a change! [insert anti-twink comments here]<br/>
<br/>
For those of you looking for good xp in the early 30s, try the giant<br/>
fortress in Frontier Mountains... its OMG good xp.  We had a balanced group<br/>
(31 bard, 31 monk, 34 warrior, 27 cleric) and pretty much fought nonstop.<br/>
Set up shop right inside.  Got just over a bubble an hour but you gotta<br/>
watch out for those Mountain Giant Craigs (ouch!).<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone participate in the ToT finals on test?  Hear they were great<br/>
fights!!! My guild got bumped out after a couple rounds to a PvP team but<br/>
weere still happy :)  <br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone had a good weekend :)<br/>
