The Jig o&#39; Vigor saved my life when I crashed and ended up in the Ocean of<br/>
Tears. It was the only thing that allowed me to stay swimming whilst I<br/>
petitioned a gm to get me out of there. No, I didn&#39;t have the water<br/>
breathing song, either. Note to other bards: Put this song on and swim into<br/>
a wall head slightly up, then go eat lunch, if you want to improve your<br/>
swimming dramatically. ;-)<br/>
