<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267431864">I must agree here with Barrd, get out of that guild, Faras!  Surely there<br/>
are others that can provide what you are looking for.  I was very very<br/>
hesitant about joining a guild (Karana server) because I saw some bad<br/>
examples of how some guilds treat even their own members. But, I had a dear<br/>
friend who gently encouraged me to join one, and never gave up on me, and I<br/>
finally joined, and couldn&#39;t be happier!  Kinship Of Valor is so very much<br/>
like a family, its amazing.  Giving and concern and comraderie are the<br/>
norm. And if anyone is ever in need, help is always on the way!  I love it!<br/>
