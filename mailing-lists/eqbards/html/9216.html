<div id="ygrps-yiv-420725877"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Speaking of which, the bug where you continue to play songs<br/>
&gt; when knocked unconcious extends to spellcasting too.  I saw<br/>
&gt; someone start to cast a heal spell on himself, get knocked<br/>
&gt; unconcious, successfully channel and get the spell off, and<br/>
&gt; pop up as he healed himself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah... I had the same thing happen to me once - saved my life.  I had just<br/>
finished polishing off a harrier in south karana.  I was looting the body,<br/>
when another harrier jumped me.  He got a couple sweet hits on me that drove<br/>
me below one bubble of health (I was heavily damaged to begin with).  I<br/>
immediately tried to Fear + Chain him (this was my first mistake - I should<br/>
have just zoned).  Needless to say, it didn&#39;t work to well.  He hit me a<br/>
couple more times and I went down cold.  Immediately afterwards, Appalling<br/>
Screech fired and it &quot;stuck&quot;.  The harrier took off and I slowly regained my<br/>
feet.  I quickly busted out my drum and boogied to Lake Rathe while uttering<br/>
a prayer of thanks to Bristlebane.<br/>
