<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-70313610">A couple days ago I was standing next to a couple NPC&#39;s and laid out a<br/>
bellow.  Seconds later, I was laid out.  <br/>
<br/>
So, is bellow AE in some way?  Or did I have the NPC targeted by accident?<br/>
I would swear that I had the monster targeted.<br/>
