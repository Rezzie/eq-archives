&gt; dropped a basalt carapace her first pull.  out of the shin ghoul knights<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; the bedroom, one dropped the shin greaves.  i am liking this so far.  now<br/>
&gt; the bad news.  7 sand giants, 5 Griffins, 3 Hill Giants and NO lambent<br/>
&gt; stones.  argh.  i told her to petition and make sure they are in the game.<br/>
