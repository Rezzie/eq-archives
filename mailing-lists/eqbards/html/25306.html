<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-888499946">Had some bad luck with these 2.  Nortlav got mad at us when we pulled Yael.<br/>
Yael got mad at us when we tried Nortlav (even though Norty was almost all<br/>
the way across the room.  We had 3 groups so fighting both at once was not<br/>
really an option.  Any tips on how to kill these guys when both of them are<br/>
up?<br/>
