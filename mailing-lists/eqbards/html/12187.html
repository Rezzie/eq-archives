<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943632029">I heard from a level 50 that the gypsies are actually lycanthropes and that at<br/>
night werewolves will spawn in their place.  The good thing is that they can<br/>
still drop the gypsy lute/Lute of the Gypsy Princess and battle drum.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Also, something I&#39;ve been meaning to mention on the list.  I was in MM at 40<br/>
&gt; with a 50 Druid and we were trying to pick up MM drums for trade items.  I<br/>
&gt; was flabergasted when we looted MM drums (at night) from a werewolf that<br/>
&gt; spawned in Mynthi Davissi&#39;s spot.  All I can say is one green werewolf was a<br/>
&gt; whole heck of a lot easier to deal with than a charming blue caster with an<br/>
&gt; animation.<br/>
