<div id="ygrps-yiv-877704180">Hi there all fellow bards, I am new to this group and I already spent <br/>
much of my eq-allocated time here on these pages today, thanks to <br/>
your messages.<br/>
<br/>
My question is: What are the possibilities for a bard around mid <br/>
twenties to get some good xp from soloing? Or shall I forget about it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
