<div id="ygrps-yiv-242366697">One you get out of their &quot;sense range&quot;, they will just stop tring to<br/>
chase you down, careful, because they will remember as soon as you<br/>
get back into this range.<br/>
<br/>
This range is fairly large, but a bard with a drum can easily<br/>
do it.<br/>

&gt; On this mobs giving up the chase...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How does this work?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been killing giant scarabs in Misty (got lvls 8,9 an 10<br/>
&gt; yesterday!!!!) and sometimes they seem to just give up the chase.  THey<br/>
&gt; are still alive (on my target bar)  but never show up...<br/>
