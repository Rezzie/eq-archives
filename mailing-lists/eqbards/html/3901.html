<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510029790"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I am pretty sure that you DO move slower in different kinds of envoriment,<br/>
&gt; just try moving on to the sand in east commons or the ice (frozen rivers)<br/>
&gt; in Everfrost the sand will slow you down and the ice will have a slippery<br/>
&gt; feel to it?<br/>
&gt; So from my experince its not zones that are slower but the materials you<br/>
&gt; run on, makes sence in my oppion. Ohh and you seem to loose vigor faster<br/>
&gt; too when running/walking in high snow or sand.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t noticed any speed difference, &#39;slippery&#39; effect or change in<br/>
stamina with sand, grass, road, snow or ice. Only difference I notice is<br/>
the textures (which can affect your perception of your speed).</div>
