<div id="ygrps-yiv-92982669">I am either a Black Helicopter watching Psycho, or another Bard that can&#39;t<br/>
play songs as reliable as before.  Anyway, this was the final nail in my<br/>
frustration coffin, and so I have retired my 33rd Level Bard, Narcissus of<br/>
Povar.  Hopefully this retirement will be temporary (it is has lasted only a<br/>
week or so, so far).   Meanwhile I am exploring other classes and *reducing*<br/>
my dependence on grouping (more or less limiting my group size to my wife<br/>
and I).</div>
