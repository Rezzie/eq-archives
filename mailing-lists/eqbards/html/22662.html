&quot;- Bards of the land, hark unto me: The notes have been scribed on tattered parchment, two score and nine, for you they are meant.  Abandon your mates, though they may fume, and follow the call of the seafarer&#39;s tune.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First thing that came to mind...&quot;two score and nine&quot; == 49.<br/>
<br/>
Songs like we just got our 49th song, and they hid it in a quest or in a sea zone (spell merchie on &#39;clops island in OOT comes to mind).  Hope it&#39;s good!<br/>
