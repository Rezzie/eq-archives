<div id="ygrps-yiv-791286180">I agree also but that&#39;s no reason a bard should get a better armor than a <br/>
warrior IMHO. Not complaining though, hehe. :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt;Now, I&#39;m just talking about taking damage - sure, bards can use songs to<br/>
&gt; &gt;counter their disadvantages. But, my point is that better armor will not<br/>
&gt; &gt;make a bard a better tank than a warrior of equal level.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I agree, what I was trying to say is that a bard in better armor will only<br/>
&gt;last a few more rounds than normal, they would still die when compared to a<br/>
&gt;warrior is worse armor who would live, for exactly the reasons you<br/>
&gt;mentioned. </span></blockquote></div>
