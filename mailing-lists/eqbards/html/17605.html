<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473498088">I&#39;m not sure which vendor sells it, however a 46th level bard in my guild<br/>
found the 39th level song today after the patch.  I was logging when he<br/>
started yelling about it, so I didnt get which town... all I saw was &quot;the<br/>
girl in the back&quot;.  That could mean any of the guildhouses.<br/>
<br/>
The 39th level song is a new charm song, and requires 5 mana to use.<br/>
*cheers*<br/>
