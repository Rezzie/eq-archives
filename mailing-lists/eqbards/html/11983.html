<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039834789">Whenever you deal with a &quot;god&quot; on an online game its a tricky point. <br/>
He&#39;s a god!  He shouldn&#39;t be scratched by mere mortals, yet he mucst be<br/>
killable or people would just get mad.<br/>
<br/>
You have yo jutify many things when you play EQ.  Why does that Hill<br/>
Giant who chased me for an hour (in game time) suddenly decide to stop<br/>
mid swing, with me at death&#39;s door because I stepped through a wide<br/>
mountain pass (zoning from oasis to S RO).<br/>
<br/>
Why does Deputy Bupo who regards me warmly, and I have dealth with<br/>
personally many times (IE turned in belts) decide to gut me because I<br/>
happened to be grouped with a slightly naive druid who accidentally<br/>
caught a goblin spy in his AOE spell (barely hurting the goblin).<br/>
<br/>
Why doesn&#39;t Lady Vox learn of this small horde of powerful adeventurers<br/>
ripping through her defenses, and grab her treasue and get the flock out<br/>
of there...  In addition when this small horde fails, why doen&#39;t she eat<br/>
the corpses to prevent a future attack.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone here coulde list 100 of these without waking up the hamsters in<br/>
the head.<br/>
<br/>
As for CT maybe you are just seeing a small fraction of his actual self<br/>
and he isn&#39;t too attentive of whats going around him.  Its like a person<br/>
seeing a small misquito squad up ahead.  THe person has the power to<br/>
smite them effortlessly, yet ignores them to one decides to bite him. <br/>
At which point he bashes like crazy or gets the AOE &quot;Off Spray&quot; spell. <br/>
Maybe CT needs emperical knowledge of his foes before he can use his<br/>
touch of death (&quot;Bart!  Don&#39;t use the touch of death on your sister&quot;). <br/>
Perhaps he needs a sample of their life pattern (transported by<br/>
messengers) to DT them.<br/>
<br/>
Again think of it however you want.  I find the DT pretty darn cool,<br/>
though I will never bee high enough level to experience it first hand.<br/>
