<div id="ygrps-yiv-451751210">The whole thing to me seems like business as usual for your friendly<br/>
neighborhood bard.  Granted, I was sort of hoping to get a few of the more<br/>
relevant irritating issues addressed and thought we stood a better chance<br/>
than before, but what the heck...more of the same of what we are accustomed<br/>
to.  Will I stop playing my bard? Nahh.<br/>
