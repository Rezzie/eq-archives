 On SOS ..there real problem we have is not enough &quot;spell/song&quot; gems :(<br/>
 I was in Karnor&#39;s Dead Captain and SOS was great. Sprit Callers Pets<br/>
could not touch me. I just kept mixing it in with VOV and dropped out<br/>
NIV&#39;s ( right, Niv&#39;s does not stack with Shield ) for 51 Largo&#39;s. But by<br/>
the time I keep the Mana song, run song, and heal song, I have only one<br/>
slot left for crowd control. That means no shield songs or any choice<br/>
between Mez and Charm..<br/>
<br/>
  Sigh<br/>
