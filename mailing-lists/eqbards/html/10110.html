<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385103276">My bard at 35 would not even think of trying to melee solo a blue.  Well,<br/>
she does think of it; and dream of it; and drool for it especially if she is<br/>
trying to get out of a hell level.  But the reality is against it.<br/>
<br/>
Now give her 2 blues, her stein and her drum and that is another story.<br/>
<br/>
But what happens as you get older is that the mobs you face get stronger<br/>
(they hit you harder.)  The con is how much xp you will get - not how hard<br/>
they can hit you nor how much hp & ac they have.  You will find some really<br/>
tough blues and some really weak blues. And you will find less and less of<br/>
them alone or in easy to get to places.  <br/>
<br/>
In about 3 or 4 more levels, you will easily see this in Aviaks (South<br/>
Karana), Unrest (if you go, i&#39;d wait til mid 20&#39;s), PickClaw<br/>
Goblins(HighKeep), etc.<br/>
<br/>
My bard has a tough time solo melee only some greens.  Give me my group and<br/>
a red mob anytime! <br/>

My bard is only 17 and does just fine on a<br/>
blue... I don&#39;t know how she will be at 35 yet. <br/>
<br/>
I guess my point (do I have one here?) is that my bard kicks<br/>
ass in melee compared to my shaman (can&#39;t say about other hybrid classes or<br/>
about other bards or other shaman).</div>
