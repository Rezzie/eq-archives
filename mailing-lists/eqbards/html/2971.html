<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578038792">Might as well add my data point:<br/>
<br/>
Celeron 300A overclocked to 463 MHz (whee)<br/>
128 MB SDRAM<br/>
Riva TNT, 16M, AGP<br/>
Modem that connects 28000 max, as low as 19200 sometimes (really)<br/>
Running at 800x600 (1024x768 is a tad slow)<br/>
<br/>
I can easily twist 3 songs, and often 4 (Anthem + Bellow x 3)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not 24th yet, so no extra sparklies... maybe framerate will tank<br/>
then?<br/>
<br/>
Only time framerate drops is when the finger-wigglers start casting<br/>
lots of rain spells...<br/>
