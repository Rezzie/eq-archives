<div id="ygrps-yiv-171022927">dunno yet.  it would make sense though.  the way i see it, yes they are<br/>
taking 2 songs and making them useless, but i regarded them as pretty<br/>
useless before anyway.  they are taking 2 currently useless songs and making<br/>
them extremely useful in their own right, and vastly more useful than the<br/>

&gt; this...  Does the haste of these songs improve?  I mean, otherwise <br/>
