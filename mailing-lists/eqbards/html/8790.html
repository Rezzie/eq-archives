<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667676021">On the new server I started a wood elf bard.  Level 1, no spells and only<br/>
his dead sexy newbie gear and tunic.  When down to PoD lift, stood near<br/>
someone, but well outside of melee range, as they polished off an orc pawn.<br/>
<br/>
Uraahh... crap about crushbone...<br/>
Your faction with EmeraldWarrior got better.<br/>
bahbahbah<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Huh?!!?<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t even have a song nor even a single point in singing.  I considered<br/>
/reporting myself after I described this in detail (with supporting history)<br/>
in the /bug window however I heard that reporting yourself is also a good<br/>
way to get a warning from a GM... for what I don&#39;t know... :)</div>
