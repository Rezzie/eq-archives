&gt; If you were doing most of the tanking, then Warsong probably<br/>

&gt; consider using GR instead of Warsong.  It has a slight AC buff<br/>

probably use Chant of Battle instead of Anthem.  With casters<br/>
tanking, the attack speedup of Anthem is laughable.  Chant<br/>
without a drum buffs str by half the amount of Anthem, but it<br/>
also increases dex and AC.  If you&#39;re using a drum then it&#39;s<br/>
no contest - Chant will increase str by the same amount as<br/>
Anthem, and dex by the same amount as str (Anthem does not<br/>
boost dex), and gives double the AC as without a drum.<br/>
