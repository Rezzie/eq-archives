If you can kill Innoruuk, you can kill the Spiroc Lord.<br/>
<br/>
The trick to spiroc island is 100% how you pull it and in what order you<br/>
kill the things is, the spirocs themselves are easy.  Our puller died<br/>
alot testing things out, but now I feel we can clear the island in 3 hours<br/>
or so tops.<br/>
