<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741707615">I think the game mechanism that creates bard hate is centered around the type of<br/>
music the bard sings.  My bard tends to focus on alternative rock and<br/>
traditional blues while adventuring.  I have a gut feeling that most mobs in the<br/>
game prefer hip-hop or country western music.  As a direct result, they tend to<br/>
dislike it when I&#39;m singing my songs and focus all their energy on making me<br/>
stop.  <br/>
