situations that they are in that they finding this useful. If this is the <br/>
only situation where it is useful to you, that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
But other people are of a different race, have different equipment and are <br/>
involved in different groups (or are soloing) than you&#39;re own.<br/>

Respect of other&#39;s opinions will win more respect than name calling.<br/>
