<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535329764">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Please excuse my off topic post but i&#39;d like to have your opinion on the<br/>
following.  I&#39;ve started playing<br/>
on my Compaq Pressario 1692 and I find that the display is very dark.<br/>
Also, a bug exists that I can see<br/>
the top of trees and Undead creatures through Montains, dunes, etc.<br/>
It&#39;s fun to be able to do that but<br/>
rather anoying when i&#39;m in big forests as I see ALL the trees and skele<br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m supposedly using a Rage Lt Pro AGP 2X, version 5.35-c57X on this<br/>
laptop, anyone know if they mixed up<br/>
the Drivers or if any update exists ?  Any info is grealy appreciated<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
