<div id="ygrps-yiv-956763617">Uses 4 hotkeys, have two be your primary and secondary hands, have<br/>
two be two inventory slots.  Keep one of these inventory free, and<br/>
have your instrument in the other.  You still have to use the mouse<br/>
to pick up the item and switch it around, but you no longer have to be<br/>
blind while you do it.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want to switch instruments in combat, then put one instrument<br/>
in your hand, and keep the other instrument on the cursor.  This makes<br/>
it just 1 click to switch between instruments.<br/>

&gt; Oh yea that reminds of my question for today, how do you easily switch<br/>
&gt; from instrument to weapon?  I tired using hot keys, but that didnt seem<br/>
&gt; to do anything...<br/>
