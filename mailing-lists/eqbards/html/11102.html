<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109964940">I think this is the list that has the most numbers of active participants.<br/>
I&#39;m impress by the amount of information/idea/opinion flowing through<br/>
everyday. I guess this is the nature of Bards, right? sharing of tales,<br/>
get to know people all around and spreading the Lore of the Land of Norrah.<br/>
<br/>
I like to be one of those bards but I still lack the creativity and the<br/>
experience to roleplay it well. Can anybody point me to websites or share<br/>
your experience on how to roleplay it right? I wanna be a real Bard.<br/>
