<div id="ygrps-yiv-542170824">In the Plane of Fear last night I got the Death Touch from Cazic Thule three<br/>
times; bards are his favorite.  A magician in my guild that seems to get<br/>
DT&#39;d a lot (five times one night) saw me online last night and said in<br/>
/guildsay &quot;Crier get your ass up to Fear so that CT will quit DTing me.&quot;  Oh<br/>
joy.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow...  After the third DT I said &quot;Geez, I should petition a name change<br/>
do Dier.&quot;<br/>

&gt; How about Deadbard?  wait that would be too confusing with my<br/>
&gt; usual nickname<br/>
&gt; in the guild, &quot;Oh look, here comes that Deadbard guy again, shall<br/>
&gt; we invite<br/>
&gt; him in as another meat shield?&quot;<br/>
