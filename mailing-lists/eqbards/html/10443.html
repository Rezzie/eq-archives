<div id="ygrps-yiv-357214467">Has anyone noticed anything strange about Kiteing. Either I have lost my<br/>
touch or something has been altered. I cant seem to get the patteren down to<br/>
kite. Last night I tried to Kite a Deepwater Croc that was blue to me and it<br/>
was tearing me up Thankfully there was a kindly ranger nearby to help me. I<br/>
was using the DDD/CoD/Hymm twisting with an occasional selos to try and keep<br/>
distance away from him bit it just seem like i was get torn up. Anyone have<br/>
any ideas?<br/>
