<div id="ygrps-yiv-877633001"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Like I said, if the idea of casting classees having pets that<br/>
&gt; can melee better than or almost as well as melee classes makes<br/>
&gt; sense, then so does the idea of melee classes having pets that<br/>
&gt; can cast spells better than or almost as well as casting<br/>
&gt; classes.  /pet heal me, /pet nuke &lt;target&gt;, /pet evac us, /pet<br/>
&gt; mes &lt;target&gt;, /pet buff &lt;target&gt;, and make them regen mana 5x<br/>
&gt; faster than players (which is approx how fast pets heal).<br/>
