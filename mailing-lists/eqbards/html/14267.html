<div id="ygrps-yiv-568279010">Hehehe, well - don&#39;t know bout that Mushroom men sound an aweful lot like a<br/>
poggostick to me - for anyone out there that might actually remember what a<br/>
poggostick was. Or a date stamper - course - what&#39;s a Mushroom man SUPPOSED<br/>
to sound like - guess poggostick is fine.<br/>
<br/>
It does usually give my group a chuckle when I point out the similarities<br/>
tho. <br/>

&gt;Oh yes..  Virtually every mob has a movement and idle sound of some sort.<br/>
&gt;The sounds effects in EQ are the best of any game I&#39;ve every played.  That&#39;s<br/>
&gt;the one thing that I have *never* seen a complaint about in any forum.<br/>
&gt;There aren&#39;t any sounds that I can think of in the game that sound &quot;wrong&quot;.<br/>
&gt;The next time you play, pay attention to some of the sounds and try to<br/>
&gt;imagine how they came up with them.  Ambient sounds, beetles, spiders<br/>
&gt;walking, snakes hissing, frogloks (splicka, splicka, splicka), Aviaks,<br/>
&gt;lizards in CT, giants, Spectres, Ghouls...  The sounds effects in EQ are a<br/>
&gt;work of art that surpass the graphics by a healthy margin imo. </span></blockquote></div>
