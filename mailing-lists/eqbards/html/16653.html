abusable.  Have a party with 2 bards in it.  One bard sits at<br/>
the zone, other plays with the group.  If group gets in<br/>
trouble, bard at zone fires off this song, then everyone<br/>
zones.  Arguably better than evac, especially with a 3 second<br/>
&quot;casting time.&quot;<br/>

&gt; This is basically just the opposite of that song, so I<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, MMM increases entropy - takes a well organized group and<br/>
scatters them.  So you&#39;re free to make a bit more powerful<br/>
without upsetting balance, because the confusion/disorientation<br/>
factor works against the power.  The proposed song decreases<br/>
entropy.  So even though it does the same thing in reverse, it<br/>
is much more powerful/useful/abusable.<br/>
