<div id="ygrps-yiv-429784913">I noticed that during the Dual Wield thread, some of you fine Bards said that<br/>
you use a Tentacle Whip.<br/>
<br/>
I have one, but have never used it, due to the low damage and low proc.  Instead<br/>
I&#39;m using one Barbed and one Dragoon Dirk.<br/>
<br/>
Do you feel that the low delay makes it viable?  Have you seen the proc<br/>
damage/heal be enough to be attractive?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d hate to think that I&#39;m letting this baby sit because I&#39;m too much of a<br/>
goober to know better :P<br/>
