<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-814054078">I think I want to try soloing some now.  Anyone have suggestions of places I<br/>
can solo successfully at 25th level?  At 23d level, I couldn&#39;t solo rooks in<br/>
SK.  I think I might be able to do it now.   This assumption is based on<br/>
better combat skills/hit points plus I now have the Psalm of Warmth.  Is it<br/>
safe to assume that weaving Psalm of Warmth with two other songs will do<br/>
more damage than a Bellow?  How much do mobs get burned for per hit?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
