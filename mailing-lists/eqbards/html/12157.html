<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152355909">I just want to remind people to remember to put their level in posts where they talk about particular locales, etc.  When you say &quot;Place X gives good experience&quot; the information is basically meaningless if we don&#39;t know your level...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
