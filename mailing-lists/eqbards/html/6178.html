<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772778672">Heh, here&#39;s one, unless your turn-on&#39;s include naked<br/>
walks through Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron, never ever ever pull<br/>
from the back door of the house.  There&#39;s a tinee,<br/>
tiny bug that may cause the entire basement to unload<br/>
on you if you do.  Also, every 30 minutes do a saftey<br/>
zone in and out to clear off anything that may have<br/>
overheard your attemt at a battle song and would like<br/>
to offer a few critisms.  And if I looks like a<br/>
zombie, but it&#39;s got a rapier, may sure you con it<br/>
first :P<br/>
