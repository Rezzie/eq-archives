<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049853813">Specific mobs are in a &quot;giant&quot; class - they cannot be mesmerized nor stunned<br/>
- not by bards nor by enchanters.<br/>
<br/>
The Fire & Ice Giants guarding Nag & Vox are like this - as are a bunch of<br/>
other mobs.  Crowd control is done with charm or root parking.<br/>

Do giants automatically save vs Pixie Strike?  <br/>
<br/>
Was in a FM giant group last night that pulled 2, and the one resisted every<br/>
strike I threw at it...a good 5 or 6 or so.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it liked me best after that.  :P<br/>
