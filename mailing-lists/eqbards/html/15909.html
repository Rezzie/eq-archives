<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946824844">that&#39;s why i wear one diamondine and one opalline, i am a tank-bard ;)  you<br/>
are correct though, if you have to wear 2 then tanks should have 2<br/>
diamondine and bards should have 2 opalline.  but depending how one&#39;s stats<br/>
are balanced, there is a goof argument for both.  a bard with already high<br/>
charisma could use diamondines, one with high strength could use opallines.<br/>
so i wear one of each, and get the best of both =)<br/>
