<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736162374">My guild does it this way:<br/>
<br/>
Each class votes on a class rep.  That rep, in consultation with the other members of his class,<br/>
determines the loot order for no-drop class-specific equipment.  Whether this is at the individual item<br/>
level (e.g., a list for Imbrued BPs is separate from that for Imbrued Greaves), or just a rank order<br/>
(player1, player2, player3 - when player1 loots something he drops to the end) is up to the class.<br/>
<br/>
Droppable class-specific stuff is awarded by the officers, usually following the directions of the class<br/>
rep.<br/>
<br/>
All multi-class stuff is called by the officers.<br/>
<br/>
If you get an item upgrade, and your old item is droppable, you surrender the old item to the guild to be<br/>
distributed to another primary unless all primaries have something equivalent or  better.<br/>
<br/>
You have to be actively on a raid to loot an item unless nobody else can (or wants to), in which case we<br/>
can start logging on alts and absent primaries.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds kind of free-form and complicated, but it has worked pretty well.  Some players have argued that<br/>
the officers reward themselves more than is &quot;fair&quot;, but I never felt that way.</div>
