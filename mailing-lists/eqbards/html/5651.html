<div id="ygrps-yiv-1543837556">I do know the fact that the Lute of the gypsy quest doesn&#39;t lead you to the<br/>
EBW. According to Allakhazamz website, so far he hasn&#39;t had anyone do the<br/>
quest after the patch, so doesn&#39;t know the results of it. I wanna be one of<br/>
the first to do so and will post the results if I manage to complete the<br/>
quest. =)<br/>
