<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346975295">Rangers have a fair amount of ways to blow mana but still not as much<br/>
as pal/sk. In my experience the hybrid +mana enhancement has let the<br/>
rangers I&#39;ve grouped with pull longer w/o downtime for medding. Also<br/>
handy if the ranger is key snare and the group is chain pulling.<br/>
