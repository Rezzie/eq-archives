<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961473080">Hey Rokenn, I noticed your post on the Concert Hall where you mentioned that<br/>
you killed Noble Dojorn.<br/>
This is something we&#39;ve been wanting to do ourselves, but aren&#39;t sure how to<br/>
go about it.  We&#39;ve tried to pull him from his island to Gorgalosk island,<br/>
but he always seems to get stuck inside his windmill.  We&#39;ve pulled the<br/>
bladestorms without any problem, but haven&#39;t been able to get Dojorn to come<br/>
out.  Have you guys pulled him?  Or is there something I&#39;m missing?  Also,<br/>
how many people did you have when you took him down?<br/>
<br/>
