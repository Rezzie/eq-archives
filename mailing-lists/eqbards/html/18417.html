<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206520855">Most likely they desperately wanted to take a swipe at you but you were too<br/>
fast.  If they agro on you you get on their list whether they ever catch you<br/>
to take a swing or not.  This also happens on Antonica, but most zones<br/>
aren&#39;t huge enough for it to be common.  Used to happen to me with bandits<br/>
in W Karana all the time.<br/>

That&#39;s what I was finding, too.  If I got anywhere near a Drachnid without<br/>
it actually aggro&#39;ing on me or me taking a swipe at it, sooner or later I&#39;d<br/>
get a bad faction message.  Mayong really loves me now. ;)<br/>

We were getting them near the Sarnak fortress in Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
We petitioned, and the guide said if a sarnak even looked at you, you<br/>
got on its aggro list -- and thus got faction hits<br/>
