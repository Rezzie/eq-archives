&gt; What did you mean by not stacking them?  I havent tried the quests im just<br/>
&gt; curious to what you mean.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, since I had run 2 bard quests overlapping, I had thought that was<br/>
why I didn&#39;t finish the quest in Freeport.  Turns out Freeport is bugged<br/>
(or so it sounds like from reading the list), so stacking quests<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
So far I&#39;ve found new bard NPCs in Freeport, BB, and Kelethin.  Should&#39;ve<br/>
checked Felwithe while I was in that part of the world, but I learned my<br/>
way through the GF forest without needing to follow the paths, so I<br/>
forgot.<br/>
