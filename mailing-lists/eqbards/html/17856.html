<div id="ygrps-yiv-175329163">Yet another mob ripped straight out of the AD&D monster manual =P<br/>
We got ranger boots off one tonight. Also Cryo legs (snore) and Verm bracer. <br/>
Killed many scorns, but ended up with 1 pair of pee-colored pants, which <br/>
went to my friend.<br/>

&gt;pre-release.  I guess they decided to recycle it for Hate...<br/>
