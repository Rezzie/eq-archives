<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501676107">how much mana does it use for you?  i usually go down to 1.5 bubbs left.  to<br/>
get back to 3.5 bubbs is more like 30 min if i sit often enough, and i would<br/>
say 45 min to get back to full.  it&#39;s not practical, but its a nice bard<br/>
mini-harm touch.  and no i never use it or have it memmed except very<br/>
rarely.  i would much rather have a new single target bellow upgrade, like<br/>
4x bellow damage with mana usage.<br/>
