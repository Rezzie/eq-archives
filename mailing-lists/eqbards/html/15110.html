<div id="ygrps-yiv-426875307">HAHAHHAAhahah..... I&#39;ve never seen that key phrase before.  I nearly had an<br/>
accident.  The key phrase is &quot;klatu verada nicto&quot; backwards, which was the<br/>
secret phrase given to a woman by the alien in the classic &quot;The Day The<br/>
Earth Stood Still.&quot;  I love finding things like that.<br/>
