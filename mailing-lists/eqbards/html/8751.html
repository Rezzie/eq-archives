&gt; No big secret as to what burned out lightstones are for. There is a practice<br/>
&gt; research item that allows finger wigglers to build up their research without<br/>
&gt; wasting rare research componets.<br/>

lightstone, I&#39;m pretty sure the real reason they exist is to make wisps<br/>
glow before they die.  You used to be able to tell if a wisp had a<br/>
lightstone because it would glow in the dark, while ones without stones<br/>
would not.  <br/>
<br/>
After the burnt out lightstones appeared, all wisps glow in the dark.  <br/>
