<div id="ygrps-yiv-300016382">Look out, next thing you know that Erudin quest will be morphed into a<br/>
Velvet Elvis Painting quest and the reward will be an Elvis Tunic, AC: 4,<br/>
+10 Cha.  I think Ping Fizzlecutter (sp) already sells Elvis wigs (Mane<br/>

Though I do think some of the bard-only clothing should have included<br/>
toe-shoes, sequined leotards, and Vegas-chorus-line-style, rediculously<br/>
large headdresses.   Oh wait, we&#39;ve got the head dresses...<br/>
