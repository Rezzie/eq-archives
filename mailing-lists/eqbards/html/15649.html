Lullaby Bugged?<br/>
[After reviewing some evidence posted on the thread] I spoke to Geoff about the<br/>
original author&#39;s tests. It looks like there might be *something* strange going<br/>
on, but we&#39;ll have to run some more tests in House. Geoff will take another look<br/>
 at it after he gets done with the first draft of the expansion spells in the<br/>
next few days.<br/>
