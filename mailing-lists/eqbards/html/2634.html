&gt; When I mentioned that to a guildmate, the told me that when you go into<br/>
&gt; options & go un-anon, everyone else sees you as blue, though you look purple<br/>
&gt; to yourself (similar to the HIDE bug).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>FYI, the hide thing is not a bug.  You arent supposed to know if you are hidden<br/>
or not.  i.e.  in a roleplay sense, you try and hide but you have no way to know<br/>
if you cant be seen by the enemy.  get it?<br/>
