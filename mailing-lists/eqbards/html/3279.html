critical as keeping warsong/Anthem going. While I had the mino axe I was using bellow as my only<br/>
combat song. Now I throw it in as an extra while I am snick-snick-snicking my opponent to ribbons.<br/>
My total dex bonus is +11 so far (taking me to 101) which is a whole lot of extra thrashing...<br/>
