<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548425311">Well, I don&#39;t mean to seem non-democratic, but I&#39;m always going to refer to<br/>
it as &quot;juggling&quot;, since that is what I&#39;ve always called it, and what it<br/>
really feels like I&#39;m doing while playing.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, feel free to call it whatever works for you.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note:  When I wrote the player&#39;s guide for bards on EQVault, I put<br/>
in a section called &quot;The Art of Juggling&quot;, hoping the term would catch on<br/>
and replace the only other term I had heard, which was &quot;twisting&quot;.<br/>
Apparently it didn&#39;t work. :)<br/>
