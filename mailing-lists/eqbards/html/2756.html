Hail Fellow Bards,<br/>
My guild is on new bard watch for me now, and they reported a bard in Halas <br/>
bank. I did the Qeynos to HighKeep to Freeport runs last night and started <br/>
back again. I am making a list of names and locations as I go and will post <br/>
it as a spoiler maybe when I am reasonably sure it&#39;s complete.<br/>
Also, Xegony has a L50 bard now. I will try to ask him some of the questions <br/>
we talk about, what songs does he use most, what equipemnt does he prefer <br/>
etc, when I see that he is somewhere he can talk. He was in gukbottom last <br/>
night when I noticed he was 50, not a cozy spot to stop and chat. Is anyone <br/>
interested in this enough for me to post his answers?</div>
