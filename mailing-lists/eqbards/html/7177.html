<div id="ygrps-yiv-678116299">Hello there.<br/>
<br/>
New to the list, and new to a bard!  Have a 7th (almost 8th) level bard on<br/>
Tunare, and am enjoying it immensely.  I&#39;m doing mail runs just for the fun<br/>
of it, and have set up hotkeys.. &quot;Mail delivery!  Coming through! Make way!&quot;<br/>
heh.<br/>
<br/>
Was wondering of there are any bard specific websites out there?  Also, are<br/>
there any magical bard-only items to look forward to as I enter my<br/>
double-digit levels soon?  I imagine there&#39;s stuff on the Plane of Fear, and<br/>
other planes, but I&#39;d like some nice intruments (drums that give a big boost<br/>
to Selo&#39;s speed, a &quot;singing shield&quot; that enhances your combat songs, maybe?)<br/>
to get from questing, since I plan on doing a lot of that with this<br/>
character.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, ttyl<br/>
Gaelaian, bard of the 7th verse, Tunare.</div>
