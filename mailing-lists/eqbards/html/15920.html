&gt; They are more rare and they LOOK COOL!  I wear two =).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also have a platinum diamond wedding ring (yes, from my <br/>
&gt; game husband) which I like<br/>
&gt; to flash around at dragon raids =).  Fire opal on the other <br/>
&gt; hand, also a wedding<br/>
&gt; ring.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It just feels nice to have pretty jewelry!<br/>
