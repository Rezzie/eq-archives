<div id="ygrps-yiv-480160331">Can y&#39;all keep an eye out for PoM stuff, and send it my way?  That&#39;s the <br/>
only thing about Velious that I&#39;m interested in at this point.  Big fan of <br/>
Bristlebane that I am, I always thought that Halflings (the big &quot;B&quot;&#39;s <br/>
favoured race) should be able to be Bards ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
