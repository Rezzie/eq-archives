<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333397082">If you are 42+ just sing McVaxius Berserker Crescendo w/ Horn <br/>
equipped while you are banking/selling in town, goofing off with <br/>
friends or selling at the auctions.  This song won&#39;t get you killed <br/>
so you can walk around NPC&#39;s and stuff ;)  Haven&#39;t tried the start <br/>
stop thing like Sylly says though.  Will have to try that.<br/>
<br/>
There are also lots of other places where you can go to practice with <br/>
the AE&#39;s.  For instance, North Ro (mountain to the right as you are <br/>
leaving FP is a plateau), Corner of Lavastorm up from druid ring, <br/>
corner of Oasis near SRO zone (little ledge), Greater Faydark up on <br/>
the wall near Lesser Fay zone, etc.  You just got to be a little <br/>
creative ;)<br/>
