I agree, it is very satisfying using the all instrument attack. Win a duel<br/>
without even swinging a fist and revel in the stunned silence you&#39;ll be met<br/>
with, heheh. It&#39;s not always a feasible tactic, though. Weapons and bellow<br/>
are still the best way to solo a caster, I&#39;ve found. At least in the low<br/>
20&#39;s.<br/>
