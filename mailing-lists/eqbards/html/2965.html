<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076771033"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Druids in wolf form naturally run at SoW, but cannot cast SoC<br/>
&gt;&gt; on themselves.  I&#39;m curious what happens if you&#39;re grouped<br/>
&gt;&gt; with a druid in wolf form and you play Accelerando.<br/>
&gt;You end up with a very slow moving wolf when Selos stops. :)  I<br/>
&gt;tested this with a druid friend of mine last night.  Too bad...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>incidently, if you have broken SoW with selos, zoning will fix SoW, as<br/>
long as the selos isn&#39;t active (with the icon showing) when you zone.<br/>
