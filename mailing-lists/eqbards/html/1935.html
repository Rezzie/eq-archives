<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-541559630">I saw some posts about a staff of writhing on here a while ago but<br/>
didn&#39;t pay much attention (as I thought it would be out of my reach) but<br/>
I recently sold 6 pieces of small bronze plate for 500pp (sucker!) and<br/>
am now looking to buy one.  Where are these wonderful 1h blunt weapons<br/>
found?  I can go to the area and maybe buy one off a guy who just got it<br/>
or whatever... <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
