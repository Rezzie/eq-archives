<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095069967">I liked the color on lambent, especially when I had a mostly full suit on.<br/>
When I started getting imbrued though, it didn&#39;t look as good. Then I got<br/>
some kylong, and a hero bracer, and it was commented on several times that I<br/>
was really multicolored. Now I have managed to go mostly green, between SS<br/>
and dragon stuff from WW. Still have my silver helm (I love my hammerhead<br/>
bucket!) and my imbrued boots to break the monotony of all green and it<br/>
keeps me from looking like a ranger! I prefer green overall and don&#39;t see<br/>
any major fashion shifts in the near future.<br/>

camping)<br/>
