<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119959256">I don&#39;t think 51 was really that bad.  It probably just seemed worse because<br/>
we&#39;d never experienced such hellish levels before.  54 is definately brutal<br/>
though.  I think I&#39;m going on 3 weeks at 54 now :)<br/>

grats on 52!  yes, 52 and 53 are better than 51.  but 54 is worse than 51.<br/>
i heard 51, 54, and 59 are the really bad ones, worse than the normal bad<br/>
ones =/<br/>
