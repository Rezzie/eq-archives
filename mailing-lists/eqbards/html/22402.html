<div id="ygrps-yiv-411054842">It&#39;s pretty easy to see why us bards would be rather pessimistic about another mana drain song since our current one has been said to be rather useless. I&#39;d admit myself that I&#39;ve never used the song.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose, however, with other classes having a mana drain spell, that in combination, it would be more effective. The only concern would be whether it&#39;s treated as a debuff, which would mean that our song wouldn&#39;t overlap with theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Too bad Denon&#39;s Dissension wasn&#39;t more like the way our Clarity song works, as a pulse (which would allow for stacking) instead of a debuff.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d agree that the mobs in Velious would have huge pulls of mana to pull from, but if the fights are longer (since they&#39;d have equally large hit points) then maybe the mana drain could become more essential. This would be limited by how fast the mobs regain their mana as well.<br/>
<br/>
Well it&#39;ll give us something else to chew on.<br/>

&gt; 	Agreed!  However, I noticed in the new spell list that at least one<br/>
&gt; other class is getting additional mana drains...it just makes me very<br/>
&gt; curious whether or not VI has some specific uses in mind for these<br/>
