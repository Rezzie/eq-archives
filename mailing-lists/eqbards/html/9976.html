<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723102755">Another annoying looting method that sounds reasonable on the face of it: <br/>
 Many of my high-level friends, rather than randomizing among whoever <br/>
WANTS an item, randomize among whoever &quot;NEEDS&quot; an item, which is defined <br/>
(by them) as those players who will get the most utility from it.  As a <br/>
Jack-of-all-Trades, Master of None, this means that I will NEVER qualify <br/>
for an item, other than the few instruments scattered thoughout the land. <br/>
 I don&#39;t care right now, since I&#39;m so far below them I would feel guilty <br/>
taking any of the really nice stuff (and they give me some cool <br/>
hand-me-downs), but I hope this practice doesn&#39;t last.  My level 42 <br/>
Cleric friend is not very happy with the practice, either.  Yet another <br/>
case for alpha loot.  :)<br/>
