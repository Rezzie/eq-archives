<b>Subject:</b> Niv&#39;s graphic??? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259687994">Something I noticed last night... can someone confirm this?<br/>
<br/>
During some downtime last night I was doing this twist hymn, niv&#39;s, mana song till others wear off and I noticed that when I did Niv&#39;s I flung my arms out as if casting a spell instead of strumming my lute?<br/>
<br/>
I am using a gupsy lute... the 5%, +5 MR lute.  I later confirmed that everytime I played niv&#39;s with that lute... I flung my arms out.  I will test it with other strings, but another bard got the correct graphic when using his 7-string...<br/>
<br/>
Has this been around for awhile or what?<br/>
