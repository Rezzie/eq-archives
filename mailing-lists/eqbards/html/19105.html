<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332069106">The most effective way I&#39;ve found of doing it is just to set up a /assist<br/>
hotkey with no name assigned to it.  When you get in battle, target your<br/>
main tank/puller either by clicking on their name in the group bar (upper<br/>
right corner) or hit F2-F6 (F1 being yourself) then the /assist hotkey (1-6,<br/>
depending on how you&#39;ve set it up.)<br/>
