&gt; Again why ? I don&#39;t care about exp anymore. FYI if it supposts 3 full groups<br/>
&gt; of 50&#39;s on your server then they are doing something wrong. I can pull and<br/>
&gt; solo 1 sea fury non stop...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Three groups of six 50s is too much, certainly, but it does support three high <br/>
level groups.  The fact that YOU can solo them non-stop simply suggests to me <br/>
(yet again, for the umpteenth time) that Necros are tremendously unbalanced and <br/>
vastly overpowered.<br/>
