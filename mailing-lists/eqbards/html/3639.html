<div id="ygrps-yiv-456657870">I spent a game day in Kithicor last night, following Irin Lunis (not Luna)<br/>
and Ged Twigborn around. Mostly Irin. It was quite disconcerting the way<br/>
she&#39;d wander aimlessly for a few hours, so quiet, then suddenly make a mad<br/>
dash for Ged. Then buff him, then be still. Twice she wandered by burned<br/>
down houses -- which now had piles of skeletons near them, but nothing<br/>
&#39;odd&#39; was a result. Ged never did anything weird either.<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving, I searched the bottom of the lake, but found nothing.<br/>
However, I did come across &#39;a goblin&#39; and &#39;an orc raider&#39;, both alone.<br/>
Killed them both, neither dropped anything.<br/>
<br/>
Quite a few times I got goosebumps during the night, though. =)<br/>
