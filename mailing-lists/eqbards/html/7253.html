<div id="ygrps-yiv-1874796094">I have my bind skill at 100, it&#39;s incredibly useful for quickly getting<br/>
back enough hit points to return to the fray (zoned out of Mistmoore with<br/>
less than 30 five times in the past two days).  I&#39;ve maybe bound 40 wounds<br/>
since I&#39;ve hit this peak, and I haven&#39;t moved beyond it.  I know a monk<br/>
once told me his was at 135, so is 100 our ceiling?<br/>
