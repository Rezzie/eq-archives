<div id="ygrps-yiv-581280959"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I have noticed that either one of two things will happen when a mob resists<br/>
&gt; the Lament song.  Sometimes when you get the resist message the mob doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; aggro and remains where he is at.  You can then reattempt to Lament them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve noticed this too.  Whenever it does, it&#39;s like winning the lottery.  &quot;Get<br/>
ready for a fight, people!  Oh wait...never mind.  Lulled.&quot;  I wonder if this<br/>
happens with the lull spells of other classes?</div>
