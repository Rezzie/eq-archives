<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693932079">Hey - there is one easily attained (if low-level) Bard-only equpiment: The<br/>
Wind Spirit Shawl.  THere&#39;s a cute little quest that I performed with my<br/>
low level monk, not realizing the end result was Bard-only.<br/>

Just when I needed something that wasn&#39;t ;)<br/>
