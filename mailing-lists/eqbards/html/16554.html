&gt; It really seems to be semantics at this point. Ultimately, if you can<br/>
&gt; run to the ghoul lord room unmolested with the cleric/enchanter invis to<br/>
&gt; undead, but not with the bard song, then clouding is not really invis to<br/>
&gt; undead. <br/>

run to the ghoul lord room with a L20 cleric/enchanter&#39;s invis<br/>
to undead, you *will* be molested.  Likewise, when a L22<br/>
enchanter friend tried to invis some folks for a trip out of<br/>
the shin lord room, the frogs outside immediately saw through<br/>
it.  Does that make his invis not an invis?  Don&#39;t think so.<br/>
