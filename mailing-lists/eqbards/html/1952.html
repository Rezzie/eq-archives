<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718043027">Actually, you need to target the NPC you want to raise faction with for <br/>
the Carillon to work.  If you target yourself, not much will happen.  As for <br/>
Elemental Rhythms, I got mine from the League of Antonican Bards (Qeynos <br/>
guild) though I believe it can be found in Kelethin, too.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The information I have says that the level 11 song is Cinda&#39;s Charismatic<br/>
 Carrillion which is available in the Kelethin branch of the bard&#39;s guild (NO<br/>
 pun intended....) The song raises your faction with NPC&#39;s (Great for<br/>
 completing all those quests and dealing with merchants!) It is a song that<br/>
 uses wind instruments and targets yourself only.<br/>
 <br/>
 On another note, my guldmistress gave me permission to join the 9th rank. I<br/>
 am unable to locate the next song in my guild. Can someone be so kind as to<br/>
 point me to a spot to be able to learn Elemental Rhythms? &gt;&gt;</div>
