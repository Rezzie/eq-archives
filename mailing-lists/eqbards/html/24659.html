<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941926202">I&#39;ve heard rumors that casters will launch whatever is in his/her 1st gem<br/>
slot, the bottom one I believe... I was in OoT at the buccaneer camp, when<br/>
along came a druid to nuke the buc... I told him I was camping it, he said<br/>
sorry,  but after he had rooted it. He was sitting down to camp when root<br/>
broke and attacked him sitting nearby.  He just said forget it and used /q<br/>
command.  After he had the [LD] after his name, his character stood up and<br/>
fired two nukes (whatever he had loaded at the time) at the poor thing and<br/>
killed it. So there is certainly some crazy things going on after you go LD.<br/>
