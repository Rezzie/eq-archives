<div id="ygrps-yiv-903913602">Hello fellow loremasters!  <br/>
<br/>
Due to my recent adventures with the rogue Evil Eye and resulting loss of my<br/>
only decent weapon I find a desperate need to acquire wealth.  Could anyone<br/>
offer any suggestions for a 10th level, sigh was 11th once, bard to really<br/>
earn some coin?  I have found it difficult to make much as most of the<br/>
critters I get xp from are terribly cash poor in terms of loot available.  I<br/>
have a monk friend so can take on stuff slightly more powerful than I alone.<br/>
All suggestions welcomed!<br/>
<br/>
wait...almost all...if someone shouts kill snakes I think I&#39;ll scream...<br/>

     &quot;but each for the joy of the working,             <br/>
        and each to his seperate star...&quot;<br/>

<br/>
oops, looks like I&#39;ll be working for money, kust more proof the world&#39;s not<br/>
perfect };-)</div>
