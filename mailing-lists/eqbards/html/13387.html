<br/>
Your target has resisted your attempt to mezmerize it.<br/>
the froglok king&#39;s eyes glaze over.<br/>
<br/>
The spell interrupting capacity remains the same, the mob still gets<br/>
pushed back when failing the previously announced resist check and<br/>
succeeding the previously hidden one.<br/>
