<div id="ygrps-yiv-225226787">I used Chains over Snare unless I was getting outrageous Chains resists.<br/>
The main reason is that I was the puller, and couldn&#39;t waste 2 slots for the<br/>
attack speed slowdown component.  As the puller, Chains was mandatory.<br/>
<br/>
If I was having difficulty Chaining (determined early in the fight), I would<br/>
yell, and the druid/ranger would proceed to snare.  As the mob got close to<br/>
running health, I just chain Chained.<br/>
<br/>
As for mage pets, I don&#39;t usually stay in groups where the mage refuses to<br/>
become group-friendly and summon a non-earth pet.<br/>
