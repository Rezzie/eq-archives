<b>Subject:</b> OT: Recommendation for a home firewall <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591684790">I was wondering if any of you out there are using firewall software in<br/>
conjunction with EQ.  I currently use Microsoft Internet Connection sharing<br/>
on my home network, but havent installed any firewall software at all, and I<br/>
am a bit nervous about that.<br/>
<br/>
Any recommendations?  I am currently looking at WinRoute Pro as a solution.<br/>
