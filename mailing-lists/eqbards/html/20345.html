<div id="ygrps-yiv-425875114">I have been seeing the following message when I play Psalm of Purity. <br/>
The wording is from memory, but is close:<br/>
<br/>
  Your affliction has been cured by a magical enchantment.<br/>
<br/>
This is great, but oddly I didn&#39;t have an affliction at the time ;P. <br/>
A party member said he was cured of boiling blood by my song (Lava<br/>
duct crawlers, Sol B).<br/>
<br/>
Other experience?<br/>
