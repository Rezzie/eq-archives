<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925343805">Here is another idea that I just thought of that we can add to the petition.<br/>
I was thinking why not increase the amount of songs we can memorize at one<br/>
time. 8 might be satisfying to the caster but to me I want more.  We all<br/>
agreed that each one of our songs are unique right rather than like pure<br/>
casters where most of their spells are an upgrade.  Would it not be great<br/>
for us to beable to mem more than 8 since each songs takes us so long to<br/>
mem.  With caster, each spell they have to mem takes them like 2 seconds.<br/>
With our songs it takes forever.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of we start out with 8 slots only.  Then each 4 lvl after lvl<br/>
20, we get 1 extra slot to mem our songs.<br/>
<br/>
What do u all think?<br/>
