<b>Subject:</b> Need advice for an off-hand weapon <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-879725440">Currently I&#39;m a 45 bard using an Ebon Razor (9/25, +4 MR/FR/CR) in my<br/>
primary slot (coz its primary hand only) and a Journeyman&#39;s Walking Stick<br/>
(9/24, +4 STR/WIS/INT procs Tashani) in my off hand.  I would like to find<br/>
an off hand weapon better than the Ebon Razor so I can switch the JWS over<br/>
to primary hand (that proc is sweet for bards).  I suppose I could buy a<br/>
SSOY but before I fork out the cash for one of those was wondering if there<br/>
was something better I could get for around 2K plat.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
