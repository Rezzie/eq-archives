&gt; My enchantress friend and I are searching for the Siryn Hair Hood (AC 5, +13<br/>
&gt; Charisma, +10 Resistance to Fire. All/ALL).  Does anyone have an idea where<br/>
&gt; this could be found? I have heard both Rathe Mountains and Ocean of Tears.<br/>
&gt; Any help would be appreciated.<br/>

The spoiler space wasn&#39;t needed really, because I don&#39;t have a definate answer,<br/>
but one thing I know pretty darn well is the Ocean of Tears.  This item, if it<br/>
comes from there, must be off a very rare NPC that I have never seen, and I&#39;ve<br/>
seen some NPCs that most people probably don&#39;t even know are in the OOT like<br/>
Gull Skytalon, Mojo the Tainted and the rare wandering sister of erollisi Naya<br/>
Driftwood who drops the equally rare &quot;Purity Belt&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
(joking about the rarity of the purity belt)<br/>
<br/>
There ARE sirens in the OOT though, but they&#39;ve never dropped this item as far<br/>
as I know.<br/>
