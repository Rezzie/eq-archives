<b>Subject:</b> Fwd: How many lutes do they have in Kelethin anyways? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-305572767">Greetings all, I am the wood-elf Kendrin, bard of the 4th rank, in Kelethin.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a question regarding the quest given by Sylia Windlehands -- how<br/>
many times can you do it?  Every time I talk to her (hoping to get another<br/>
quest) she asks me for the spiderling silks.  Having done this quest 3 or 4<br/>
times, I can only ask -- how many lutes do they have there that need strings?<br/>
<br/>
Are there other quests in Kelethin that a bard can do, aside from offering<br/>
to locate people&#39;s corpses for them?<br/>
