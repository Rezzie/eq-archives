Thanks for the pointers, I know where the library is. As for why bothering to buy<br/>
the song, the answer is completeness. At some point they may add more to the<br/>
song&#39;s ability, and since I made the trek to Qeynos, why not stop by Erudin and<br/>
pick up a copy? It&#39;s like having all the trading cards in a series. *smiles*</div>
