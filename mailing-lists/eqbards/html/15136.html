<br/>
When I was looking through the Onelist directory I noticed that there<br/>
were mailing lists for almost every server. But there wasn&#39;t any for<br/>
the Bertoxxulous server. So I just created one now EQBertoxxulous. If you on the Bertoxxulous server and want a way to meet others on the server or just chat with them then this is the place.<br/>

...And Justice for All<br/>
