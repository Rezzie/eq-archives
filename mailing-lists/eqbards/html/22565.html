<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252249161">I have a Duron based system using a Giga-byte motherboard, and I have<br/>
experienced no problems with EQ after the patch.  If it was a VIA-based<br/>
motherboard problem, I should be experiencing pauses also.<br/>

That&#39;s not my problems.  I tried that and tried disabling the sound (this is<br/>
very easy to do - create a text file called &quot;nosound.txt&quot; (contents don&#39;t<br/>
matter) in your EQ directory.<br/>
<br/>
Made no difference whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried everything logical and many things not logical.  It&#39;s a<br/>
code/compatibility problem - that I suspect is with VIA-based Motherboards..<br/>
