<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016766174">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a level 24 bard, soon to be 25. Seeing as how the next few songs are<br/>
available in kelethin, I figured I&#39;d make mistmore my new home. I was<br/>
wondering if you had any advice in so far as what areas are appropriate for<br/>
my level and what to watch out for (besides the massive trains)<br/>
