<div id="ygrps-yiv-390965361">&quot;I manage to hit level 17 and screamed back to FV to train dual wield.<br/>
After a bit of looking around I asked if there was a bard trainer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unless it&#39;s changed, we bards do not have to train Dual Wield.  Once you hit<br/>
17, just zone or relog, and you&#39;ll be able to wield both weapons.  Your<br/>
initial skill will be 34.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it&#39;s been a long time, so this may have changed.<br/>
