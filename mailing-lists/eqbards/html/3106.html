<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049864515">I know that I like some of you are struck with an overriding amount of<br/>
guilt when you are stuck with a very bad group.  It is both difficult for<br/>
you escape without looking like the villian.  Whenever I feel the need to<br/>
leave a group that I dislike after they have ignored my comments for<br/>
improving theoverall nature of the group, I usually tell them that a guild<br/>
member or friend is in need of some help.  To leave on a good note I only<br/>
leave when they are in a good condition, fully healed are ready to fight.<br/>
And to leave them with a good impression of me I will usually wish them<br/>
luck.  A good number of these bad party members will improve and<br/>
eventually learn to play in a group, so it is best not to provoke them who<br/>
knows when they might save you in the future. =)<br/>
