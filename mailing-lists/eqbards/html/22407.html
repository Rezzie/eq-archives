I am wondering if this really really does work how well it could/would be used aginst Vox.  I understand resist rates would have to be taken into account but if it does drain that much mana that&#39;s not too bad.   From my understanding the other mana drain song was like trying to suck a watermellon through a straw.... <br/>
