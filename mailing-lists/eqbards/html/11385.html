<div id="ygrps-yiv-659909170"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I was able to trade 2 black pearls for my choker. For<br/>
&gt; a while, around lvl 10 or so, I ran around SK, Rathe<br/>
&gt; Mountains, and EK, auctioning &quot;buying black pearls&quot;. I<br/>
&gt; would buy them at the site of the kill, and sell them<br/>
&gt; for 100pp apiece to jewelers I knew. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I saw a star ruby plat veil for 750pp last night from <br/>
  an enchanter who was selling stuff really cheap.  So<br/>
  I guess it&#39;s all in who you talk to.  And being at the<br/>
  right place at the right time.  Must be the new influx<br/>
  of L34 enchanters trying to undercut the traditional<br/>
  prices.  Some of these people selling plat jewellery<br/>
  I had never heard of before.<br/>
