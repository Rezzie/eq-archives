<div id="ygrps-yiv-25871079">On Rokenn&#39;s Site it states that the speed component of Anthem and Warsong<br/>
will not stack.  I ran a little experiment last night and here are the<br/>
results.  I was naked at the  time CT will do that to you.<br/>
<br/>
No Songs:     	Attack - 275<br/>
<br/>
Anthem:        	Attack - 290<br/>
<br/>
Warsong:      	Attack - 290<br/>
<br/>
Both Woven: 	Attack - 303<br/>
<br/>
So it looks like even the speed components do stack, but only partially.<br/>
