<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696724606">level is the most important resist item.  so the lower level you are, the<br/>
higher you want your resists at.  generally an unbuffed 100CR or 100FR is<br/>
good for vox or nag, respectively.<br/>

&gt; Currently I dont have anything special in the ways of resists...<br/>
