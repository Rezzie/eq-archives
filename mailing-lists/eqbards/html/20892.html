<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-586699533">With Bravura&#39;s nerf a while back (due to someone charming Cazic Thule  lol!), it seems to me that it would be, funadmentally, the same as Sirens. (I am 39 now, but have yet to go buy the damned thing, so I don&#39;t know it for sure, but I can&#39;t see VI making a bard song that lasts longer than 3 seconds)<br/>
If this is so, why are we still charged a mana cost for it?  If not, could someone please explain the difference(s)  (aside from not having a level 37 cap ;p )<br/>
