<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419034455">I recall seeing some limited discussion about this in the last few weeks,<br/>
but no definitive answers:<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone determined if the LVL 22 Anti-Magic Song actually works?  I play<br/>
it (strings required) and I get the message &quot;A static pulse washes through<br/>
you&quot;.  My party and I all get the icon, but it doesnt *seem* to do anything<br/>
to harmful spell effects.  Any qualitative data would be much appreciated:)<br/>
