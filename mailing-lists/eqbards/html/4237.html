<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981854850">Hi all.  My bard is a follower of Bristlebane, and I&#39;ve been hoping to find<br/>
a temple or shrine to him, so that I can make a journey there in game<br/>
sometime, but I&#39;m at a loss.  Does anyone know if there are any temples or<br/>
shrines to Bristlebane?  I fear it may be in one of the evil cities, that I<br/>
haven&#39;t visited yet.<br/>
