<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820007348">I just discovered something about the UI changes.<br/>
<br/>
I have one machine that has Velious installed on it and one that does not.<br/>
My account is Velious enabled.<br/>
<br/>
I get the UI updates (i.e. Fullscrenn inventory, etc) on both machines.<br/>
<br/>
So, myself and a friend did some testing:<br/>
<br/>
Velious not installed, not velious enabled: No UI updates<br/>
Velious installed, not velious enabled:  No UI updates<br/>
Velious not installed, velious enabled: UI updates<br/>
Velious installed, velious enabled:  UI updates (Duh!)<br/>
<br/>
Interesting, I guess they want to give an incentive for everyone to buy<br/>
velious.<br/>
