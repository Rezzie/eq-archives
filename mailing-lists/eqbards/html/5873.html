<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527921986">I can verify that some items CAN be lost when you drop<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
A week ago, I lost a Dragoon Dirk that was in a<br/>
backpack.  I acidentally dropped the pack, and the<br/>
dirk disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
However, last night, I dropped a Dirk (yes, I broke<br/>
down and bought another one....Wisps and FS Weapon<br/>
runs to Cazic are quite lucrative) and it was still<br/>
there for me to pick it up.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure what the underlying story is on when items<br/>
disappear and when they stay, but it&#39;d be REAL nice<br/>
for us to know.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about your loss...that must have HURT (the dirk<br/>
did, and they can be had for 30p)<br/>
