<div id="ygrps-yiv-116122800">I totally agree :)  I&#39;m pretty amiable as long as I don&#39;t get my little<br/>
rebellious instincts all stirred up :)<br/>
Amazing what a &quot;please&quot; can do!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Ultimately  the real issue is people&#39;s attitudes.  Like most <br/>
&gt; people - if you<br/>
&gt; TELL me to do something I wouldn&#39;t do otherwise - I&#39;m going <br/>
&gt; to be negatively<br/>
&gt; disposed towards it.  However if you ask me - nicely - it&#39;s a <br/>
&gt; different<br/>
&gt; thing entirely.  When I hear &quot;Play manasong please&quot; - <br/>
&gt; particularly from a<br/>
&gt; cleric or enchanter - odds are - I&#39;ll include in my song <br/>
&gt; twist - even if I<br/>
&gt; feel that it&#39;s less than ideal.<br/>
