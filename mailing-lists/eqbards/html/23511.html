<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450925775">I guarantee that if I didn&#39;t know/socialize with him in RL that would be the<br/>
case for me as well.  The repeat incident and further borderline behavior<br/>
has made me wonder how well I really know him after all.<br/>

Ooooh. If this mate was in my guild, he would have gotten booted the first<br/>
time. Just heard a major rant last night from our Guildleader about mates<br/>
not being civil to each other and anyone who wasn&#39;t would get booted, no<br/>
appeal.<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s just a game, you are still dealing with people and this person is<br/>
not honorable or honest at all. I&#39;d never group with them personally.<br/>
