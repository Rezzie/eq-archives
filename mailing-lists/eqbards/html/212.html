&gt; Well what I normally do is have my healing song going then let it go for one<br/>
&gt; round so the icon appears at the top then switch to my bellows spell and<br/>
&gt; once I hit with that switch back over to healing song.. As long as the Icon<br/>
&gt; is still on the screen you heal faster.. Thats just my method :)<br/>
<br/>

This did not used to be the case in beta when I last checked.  You used to only<br/>
heal at the increased rate when the words &quot;your wounds begin to heal&quot; appeared.<br/>
