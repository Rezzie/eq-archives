<div id="ygrps-yiv-505950387">That&#39;s a really cool story Faras!  Haven&#39;t seen ya in a while bud.  I am<br/>
curious about one thing, what was the enchanter casting?  Maybe I can get my<br/>
enchanter to try a new tactic.  Every time I try chains/fear or snare/fear,<br/>
he bellows about how it will break his mezzes.<br/>
