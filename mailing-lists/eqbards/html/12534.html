<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384167715">I&#39;ve noticed the following recently while twisting songs. I&#39;m soloing and<br/>
singing Chant/Chains/Hymn and found that sometimes, just as the Chant or<br/>
Hymn is about to expire I get the following:<br/>
<br/>
You whistle an ancient warsong.<br/>
You stop whistling.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, my song kicks in just before it the buff expires, but still<br/>
expires shortly afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else know about this as a bug?<br/>
