<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711083495">I have made the trip between Freeport and Qeynos via both Highhold Pass and<br/>
the Gorge of King Xorbb.  For a Bard, I think it is very clear that the<br/>
Gorge is much easier.  Once you enter the Gorge zone you only have to follow<br/>
the left wall.  Put up Selo&#39;s and run.  That is too easy to beat.  Just<br/>
don&#39;t stop under any circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Highhold is not as difficult as it used to be because there are often many<br/>
high teens and twenties characters, but there are quite a few sharp turns<br/>
and if you have any of those chronically lost people in your party, Highhold<br/>
is not for you.  HHP also has citizens and guards that will help to defend<br/>
you, which is its main good point, but for sheer simplicity the Gorge is my<br/>
favorite.</div>
