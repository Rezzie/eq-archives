<div id="ygrps-yiv-781607752">And no one up to that point had killed the dragon that it was found on?<br/>
Coincidence?  I doubt there was any coincidence.  Paranoid Bard who needs to<br/>
relax?  Probably.<br/>
<br/>
        Hmmm - Bards complain publicly that certain Singing Armor pieces<br/>
have never<br/>
  dropped.  Lots of Bumps on the BBS.  No response from Verant; but one<br/>
  assumes they saw the Thread.<br/>
<br/>
        A patch goes on the server.  THEN a Singing Breatplate is found on a<br/>
  server.<br/>
<br/>
        Could this be coincidence?  Did they find an error in the Drop<br/>
Tables and<br/>
  secretly fix it?<br/>
<br/>
        We will never know for sure...<br/>
