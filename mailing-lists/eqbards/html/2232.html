<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230410895">Actually, it is totally time consuming and unnecessary if everyone can be <br/>
bound anyplace.  Again, I am not asking that we bards be allowed to do the <br/>
binding, just that all of us be allowed to be bound anywhere we are standing <br/>
like more than half the other characters in the game can.</div>
