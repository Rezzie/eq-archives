The /con system purports to be a way of deciding whether to attempt a fight<br/>
based on some sense of your chance of winning.  You&#39;re saying that is a<br/>
weaker part of the rule than using it as a measure of what XP reward you&#39;ll<br/>
get.  Your analysis sounds correct, and I feel like I was blind-sided by<br/>
software, lack of documentation, and lack of communication skills.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fine to be misled in game, but Verant&#39;s sloppyness fosters the sort of<br/>
wild mix of in-game and out-of-game mechansims that we all use to various<br/>
degrees and unfortunately pushes strongly in the direction of playing the<br/>
software instead of living in the virtual world.<br/>
