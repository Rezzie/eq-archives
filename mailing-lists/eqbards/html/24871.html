<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107809438">Hokay..I&#39;m running by, see this temple area with ogres around it..they con<br/>
amiable to indifferent, so I cruise up there and WHAMMO.  Dead as a<br/>
doornail.  I was 16th level, and I was dead in less than 2 seconds.  Not to<br/>
mention I lost my level retrieving my corpse. *sigh*.  Now...last I<br/>
checked, amiable and indifferent didn&#39;t make them want to kill you..or I&#39;d<br/>
REALLY be dead in most cities.  What&#39;s going on w/ that?</div>
