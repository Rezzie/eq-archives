who gets cancel magic, I&#39;d suggest one quick weapon and one<br/>
slow weapon.  Some mobs have innate damage shields or get<br/>
buffed with one.  With these shields, you take a fixed amount<br/>
of damage every time you hit them.  A quick low damage weapon<br/>
can be disastrous against these.  When I encounter them, I<br/>
swap my dirk into my secondary hand and put my barbed whip in<br/>
my primary.<br/>
