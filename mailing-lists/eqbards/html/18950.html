<div id="ygrps-yiv-1340779939">The new bard 1HS looks amazing, I&#39;ve always wanted to look like a Final Fantasy character.  Just a thought though on the new monk only Cane of Harmony.  Anyone else think this is a mistake?  I&#39;m just thinking perhaps they input another wrong number in the database and made this item monk only and not bard only:<br/>
<br/>
