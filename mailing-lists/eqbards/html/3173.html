<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308286336">My troll warrior with AGI 71 (BBC, with 2 +2 agi earrings) runs JUST AS<br/>
FAST as my DE Rogue hunting partner with 111 AGI. If you are out running<br/>
someone at normal speed SOMETHING else must be the problem.<br/>
<br/>
And believe me, i have selected my hunting partner and hit &quot;autorun&quot; and<br/>
followed him from Neriak to Lake Rathe, with him never slowing.<br/>
