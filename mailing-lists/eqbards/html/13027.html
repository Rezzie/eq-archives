saw the &quot;mob is enthralled&quot; message, the mob got in a double<br/>
attack on the enchanter, then it stood mesmerized and the<br/>
enchanter walked away.  So I think most of these immediate<br/>
attacks are just a result of the messages coming out of order.<br/>
<br/>
On the flip side, the phenomenon of mobs nodding (Lullaby) or<br/>
eyes glazing over (Pixie Strike) and continuing to attack is<br/>
very real.  Hopefully this extra resist message, when put in,<br/>
will help clarify exactly what&#39;s going on.  If it does what I<br/>
think it will - make a lot of bards aware of just how nerfed<br/>
these songs are - the uproar may be enough to get them<br/>
unnerfed.<br/>
