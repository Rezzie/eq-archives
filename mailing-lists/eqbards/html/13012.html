<br/>
&gt; &gt; wait til you get the maestro with the 2 ERU/PAL only shields.  what a<br/>
&gt; &gt; complete waste of time.  i have the lute too, my estimation was originally<br/>
&gt; &gt; 20% but i think it could be 25 to 30% increase.  whatever it is, i heal 25<br/>
&gt; &gt; per tick sitting.  isn&#39;t the normal 19? </span></blockquote></div>
