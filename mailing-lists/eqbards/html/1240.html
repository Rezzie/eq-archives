<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154689503">well the male one looks like a bird landed on his head.  the female one<br/>
looks cool, except there are huge pointy ears on the sides which i have<br/>
never heard anyone liked.  my character is female, and i passed on the plate<br/>
helms.  but we all have our preferences, enjoy your helm!<br/>

I am a wood elf bard with a bronze helm, and it is my favorite possesion! I<br/>
love the way it looks, and it constantly attracts tons of attention and<br/>
compliments . . . I wonder if we are talking about a different helm? Can&#39;t<br/>
imagine anyone not liking the way mine looks . . . <br/>
