<div id="ygrps-yiv-928096317">What exactly prompted this strike?  I mean, I know about all (or very<br/>
nearly all) the nerfs we&#39;ve gotten.  So I&#39;m not looking for a full detailed<br/>
history beginning in beta 2 or anything like that.  I&#39;m just wondering what<br/>
the last straw was.  I think I missed that while I was away from EQ and<br/>
this list for about a month.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
