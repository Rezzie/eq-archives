<div id="ygrps-yiv-272144866">i&#39;ve never even tried the psalms of warmth and cooling, but i will check<br/>
them out tonight.  get the level 40 song, so maybe you can tell us what it<br/>
does, cause no one can see any discernible effects.<br/>
<br/>
Also with the fear song, you dont need someone to ensnare.  Solo away with<br/>
chain/fear twisting (dunno what word we are using now hehe).<br/>
<br/>
And yes the Tuyen&#39;s and Fufil songs are single Target.<br/>
