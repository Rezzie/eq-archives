<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088762930">it&#39;s on Karana server.  i&#39;d rather hold back the guild name so i don&#39;t smear<br/>
their name.  (hoping that I can convince the guild to let bards at least<br/>
have loot rights to swirlspine and fbss)<br/>
<br/>
with the speed cap, it makes sense for the top-notch speed gear go to the<br/>
melee&#39;s without a haste song.  (since we hit it with just about any haste<br/>
item)<br/>

I think you should find a new guild, but make sure any close friends you<br/>
have in the guild know why you&#39;re leaving.<br/>
<br/>
What server/guild is this anyway?<br/>
