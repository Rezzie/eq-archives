<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125355126">My favorite triple chant (or double chant with bellow)group was me druid<br/>
enchanter, similar to the group with the wizard, but we just snare it, let<br/>
it punch the enchanter once (so pet attacks), then DOT the heck out of it .<br/>
I got to do it alot as a married couple in my guild was a similarly leveled<br/>
enchanter/druid :-)<br/>
<br/>
With clariry and my song, we pretty much had no down time (druid would pull<br/>
while I sang my tunes to his wife, hehehe)<br/>
<br/>
Again, we felt like we were cheating it was so easy.  The only problem was<br/>
(as with all outdoor camps for me)  its got boring.  All three of us vastly<br/>
prefered a 6 guild member hit on a dungeon to the xp camp...</div>
