<div id="ygrps-yiv-238601368">I think my favorite experience as my troll warrior (first real EQ char)<br/>
was fighting the enchanter in Upper Guk (the guy with the int rings or<br/>
some mojo junk).  We start the fight (our technique was to have all 6 of<br/>
us just charge him and beat the snot out of him).  Well he gets off his<br/>
first charm on the #1 tank (Me).  Before the party knows what is<br/>
happening (This was early in the game we actually didnt know what spells<br/>
he cast and what loot he dropped, imagine that).  I have turned around<br/>
and I&#39;m ripping the poor wizard to shreds.  It all goes downhill from<br/>
there, and I (and my new froggy friends) win the fight.  Two new notches<br/>
in my belt (the delf wiz and ogre SK).  However I&#39;m still charmed, so I<br/>
start to wander through Guk (thinking how much this CR is going to<br/>
suck).  I eventually wander into the entrance zone and slaughter about 5<br/>
newbies (I think there was a train from the enchanter, but didnt seem to<br/>
hop on for awhile).  I feel bad, but I&#39;m also in tears (of laughter)<br/>
from all the weird things people are saying to me.<br/>
<br/>
Happily (for me) charm ends and I am like 5 ft from the zone... heh...<br/>
