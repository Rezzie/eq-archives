lute when I wasn&#39;t there) could give the lute to the NPC, and<br/>
I could give the NPC the carapace and ruby lambent, and I<br/>
would get the breastplate?<br/>
<br/>
Do I really want to try this experiment considering it took me<br/>
3 days to get that damn carapace?  Anyone know of a similar,<br/>
easier quest we could test this theory on first?<br/>
