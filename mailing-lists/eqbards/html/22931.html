<div id="ygrps-yiv-967414280">Haven┬Æt seen you around Xegony in a while ┬û probably because I haven┬Æt<br/>
gotten around to getting a HS Key ┬û gotta do that one of these days.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway ┬û grats on 54!  I┬Æm finally making progress in 52 ┬û mainly because I<br/>
left Velious.  I haven┬Æt really found any place there where experience gain<br/>
equals what I can get in Karnor or Sebilis┬à<br/>
