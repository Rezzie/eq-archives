<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353212451">I was in a big Hole raid and didn&#39;t notice any problems.<br/>
<br/>
The only time we had one was when there was another bard in my group and we <br/>
were hanging out waiting to get everyone together. I started getting <br/>
repeatedly spammed about &quot;Quelin tries to cast a spell on you, but you are <br/>
protected&quot; every time her song pulsed. A groupmate asked what song I was <br/>
singing as he was getting spammed by me. Turns out the other bard had <br/>
jumped into the pond to swim and since we weren&#39;t in the water our songs <br/>
weren&#39;t sticking. But I don&#39;t think this had anything to do with the patch, <br/>
just the way spells work with water.<br/>
