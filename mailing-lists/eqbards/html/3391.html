L10-12.  We *thought* we were fighting just one scarab.  We<br/>
quickly had two, then three, with more coming to replace them<br/>
as quickly as we could kill them.  In the end I think we ended<br/>
up killing 8 in succession without any rest in between, and<br/>
barely made it out with our lives.<br/>
