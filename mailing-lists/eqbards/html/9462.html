<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-77072216">According to EQVault, a group of adventurers actually entered the<br/>
Plane of Hate.  They of course, didn&#39;t say where the portal was<br/>
located (I still think that the Oasis rumor makes no sense...PoF<br/>
entrance is near Cazic&#39;s temple, why would Innoruk&#39;s plane be in the<br/>
middle of the desert?  I still stand on my Nektulos forest or Kithicor<br/>
(only because the culmination of last night&#39;s event seemed to take<br/>
place in Kithicor))...if the Vault story is untrue, or only on the<br/>
test server, we&#39;ll probably see the PoH open up in the next patch. I<br/>
did, however, notice that the PoH zone file was updated in the last<br/>
patch.  Total speculation...<br/>
