<div id="ygrps-yiv-1994633953">Don&#39;t forget that Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens is wind based.  I would think<br/>
using an instrument would improve one&#39;s ability to successfully charm more<br/>
than a crude stein.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re trying this at night, try to find a magician to summon you a<br/>
coldstone, or a shaman to cast ultravision.  Trying to weave selo&#39;s,<br/>
solon&#39;s and lyssa&#39;s concord makes for a lot of pain.<br/>
