<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746437316">Anyone hear any more on this?  I check a bracer of Erollisi last night<br/>
figuring if the change affected current items that that would surely be one<br/>
of them.  My agnostic rogue had no problem wearing it nor did it say<br/>
anything about deity when I right clicked it.  <br/>
