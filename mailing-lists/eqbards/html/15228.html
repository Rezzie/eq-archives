<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-145096402">Ok, I know that you want to keep your best weapon in the primary hand, but how do you apply that rule when<br/>
one weapon has an effect. I have a silvery war axe and an Obsidian Shard. Both have damage 6. However,<br/>
the shard has a longer delay and an effect and the axe has a shorter delay. Which is better in the<br/>
primary? My uderstanding of how the effect works is that if I putt it in the secondary hand, the effect<br/>
roll will only happen when the duel wield goes off.<br/>
