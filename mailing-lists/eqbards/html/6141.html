&gt;one from the doing the ogre head quest in kaladim first shot, i had bought<br/>
&gt;one head for 7pp and a friend got me the second one, it pays to help out<br/>
&gt;lower level friends sometimes as they hunt these zones and see whats being<br/>
&gt;given away/sold in them hehe (Cornflunk and Zarchoomi).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The heads are nodrop now - sometimes people well allow you to pay for the<br/>
priveledge of letting you loot Zarchoomi&#39;s corpse or whatever though.<br/>
