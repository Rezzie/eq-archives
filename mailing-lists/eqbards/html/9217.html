&gt; &gt; I refuse to buy ANY lambent stones on principle :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Same here... ultimately it&#39;s just a matter of time before I&#39;m able to find<br/>
&gt; one myself (gotta love charm).  I&#39;d be willing to go as high as 25pp - just<br/>
&gt; to save myself some time.  Unfortunately, more often than not, the people<br/>
&gt; selling Lambent Stones (as noted previously, they generally tend to be<br/>
&gt; druids) are asking outrageous prices for an object they can&#39;t even use.<br/>
<br/>

giants.  Like I said, in a typical night of hunting giants,<br/>
everyone in my group will get a stone (we did this twice).<br/>
Given the rate they drop, I&#39;d value them at around 10-15pp.  <br/>
You&#39;d have to be nuts to expect 150pp one.<br/>
<br/>
Other classes can use the stones.  There is a quest for some<br/>
sort of staff that uses the stones, and the bard armor is not<br/>
no-drop so could be traded/twinked.  Dunno if other classes<br/>
can do the quests.  Still, I&#39;d expect it to soon become like<br/>
crafted armor, where the resulting armor sells for a little<br/>
above or even below the cost of the gems to complete the<br/>
quest.<br/>
