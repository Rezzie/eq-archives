Subject: [eqbards] Mudwater Rune no drop?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a RL lvl 35 Rogue friend who acquired a Mudwater Rune recently. He<br/>
can&#39;t recall offline if it&#39;s No Drop. I figure it is, being a quest item,<br/>
but thought I&#39;d ask. He didn&#39;t reply when I asked him casually if he&#39;d get<br/>
an Opoline Helm for me, too. *g*  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

p.s. If I get it, that will make one component of every lambent piece.<br/>
Already have Shin items, Griffene Charm, both Runes of the One Eye, and the<br/>
breastplate. Didn&#39;t think I&#39;d be nearly this far along yet, Harmonic not<br/>
withstanding! So, if you&#39;re a young bard, what are you waiting for? Go for<br/>
it!<br/>
