<div id="ygrps-yiv-811472265"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;ve been thinking that the next time I fight in Cazic I will get bound in<br/>
&gt; Ogguk.  Assuming no one picks it up and takes it, I plan on leaving a spare<br/>
&gt; flute right at the zone so I can safely get back to Cazic without aggroing a<br/>
&gt; guard.  Key issue is how long will the flute stay on the ground before it<br/>
&gt; decays?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  I had no problems being bound in Oggok when making the PoF run.<br/>
  The flute will disappear as quick as anything else would.  5 mins?<br/>
  I dunno, drop some foraged grubs on the ground and start a timer.<br/>
