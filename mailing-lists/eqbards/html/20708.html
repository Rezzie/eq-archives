 </span></blockquote>Well, here is something interesting. At least, if you are a total twink.<br/>
<br/>
If your defense is 11, and your AC is 200 (and level 6), your defense will<br/>
not rise, despite being a Class A Bardic Gnoll Magnet in Blackburrow.<br/>
However, lower your AC to 100 and defense starts raising. At 18 you can go<br/>
to 13 and it will still raise. I don&#39;t have better stats because I was<br/>
mostly interested in it raising, not on getting the exact figure.<br/>
The problem was too much AC at level 1 (and then turning in bone chips to<br/>
skip a few levels) Defense never raised much at all. so now I am fighting<br/>
blues half naked and defense is on the rise.<br/>
<br/>
As an anti-twinking measure, I like it. *smile*<br/>
