<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221001729">I am starting to hear reports of problems with SoW that have been bugging me<br/>
for a while now with Selos but I have not been certain it wasn&#39;t just a<br/>
perception thing. At times I check to make sure I am using a mistmoore drum,<br/>
or am singing the correct song, or maybe it&#39;s a perspective thing (like when<br/>
levitating) or even I got left on walk after /following. But I think there<br/>
may be some client vs. server issues with speed you are supposed to be going<br/>
at and speed you actually are. Has anyone else noticed anything?<br/>
