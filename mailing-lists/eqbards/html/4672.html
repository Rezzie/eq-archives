<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766044056">Well the subject says the main point. I was using a Dragoon Dirk<br/>
5dam weapon, and I hit 14dmg every now and then already at<br/>
18th level. I think this shows quite well how truly efficient fighters<br/>
bards are with songs going on. I was weaving Jonthan&#39;s and<br/>
Chant of Battle at the time. Half elf with base str of 95.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyone here who have played a warrior or similar with a big<br/>
race with high str remember hitting over the usual max damage<br/>
of dmg*2+1 at 18th level? Or 19th for that matter?<br/>
