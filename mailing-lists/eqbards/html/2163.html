<div id="ygrps-yiv-925782491">As I ran to Halas to practice my new song the Aquatic Ayre, I noticed the<br/>
spiders were clogging up the little nook near the final path to halas. As a<br/>
young one bound there, I found it quite annoying that the spiders didn&#39;t allow<br/>
any monsters to thrive except for them.<br/>
<br/>
Equipping my trusty mandolin, I furrowed my brow, and sang and played a Mighty<br/>
Painful tune about Inoruuk, and with a chord of dissonance, the entire festering<br/>
nook of spiders perished, all at once!<br/>
<br/>
Take that, Trumpy Ratslayer, see if you can kill more than a Bard with nasty<br/>
Chords!<br/>
