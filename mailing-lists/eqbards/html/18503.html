<b>Subject:</b> What resolution do you all play at? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-875898616">I was playing with different resolutions last night and I was wondering what<br/>
resolution everyone plays with.<br/>
<br/>
I personally stick with 640 x 480 because I can&#39;t stand watching my monitor<br/>
switch resolutions when I switch to inventory or tracking mode.<br/>
