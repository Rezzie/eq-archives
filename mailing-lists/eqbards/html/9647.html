 </span></blockquote>Haha... I did this for a while in Unrest along the wall between the back<br/>
door and the porch.<br/>
<br/>
You can see a strange dungeon back there... though if you walk up the stairs<br/>
and look left (where you are looking at the other side of the wall you&#39;re<br/>
peeking through) it is just the normal first floor of the house. I have no<br/>
idea where this part of the dungeon is, though while peeking through the<br/>
wall you can see a bookshelf there... presumably the entrance to this place.<br/>
Though I&#39;ve been through down to the basement down there, I&#39;m still not sure<br/>
where it is... I think maybe it is the hag pit by where the tentacle terrors<br/>
are, by the dwarven ghost.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, be careful while doing this though... the hags WILL see you and<br/>
blast you through the walls. (Often, if you&#39;re camped at the back of the<br/>
house you&#39;ll see their spells burst out of the walls - they really are in<br/>
the basement though, not the first floor where you&#39;d think.)<br/>
