<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-240597698">there is actually a problem with the language option when you start eq.<br/>
french players had an error with the eula-file, german players experienced<br/>
problems with the eqmain.dll file. switching the language back helped in<br/>
both cases.<br/>
<br/>
the file where the language is set is named &quot;eqfecfg.cfg&quot;, set 1 for<br/>
english.<br/>
