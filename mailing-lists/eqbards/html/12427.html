<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-272864830">Someone posted yesterday that even though Mayong is in the zone, the pathing<br/>
is screwed up so you can&#39;t actually get to him.  The only way you will get<br/>
to fight him is if a GM takes control of him.  Assuming this is true,<br/>
wondering how you got your info on what Mayong looks like? Is there an old<br/>
screenshot of him from back in beta? <br/>

&gt; the Maestro of Rancor. Not sure if he is the same scale or smaller (most<br/>
&gt; likely smaller).<br/>
