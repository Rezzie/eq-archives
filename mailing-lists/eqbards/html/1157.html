<br/>
I am (or was) subscribed to two EverQuest mailing lists, this one and the<br/>
one also at OneList for Veeshan.  I have incoming mail from both sorted<br/>
into an EverQuest folder.  I received a relatively inane message amongst<br/>
the talk here and started to respond but realized it was from the veeshan<br/>
list rather than this one.  It was followed by even more inanity from that<br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
I unsubscribed from veeshan and decided I should compliment those on this<br/>
list for the quality and content of the discussion.  Bards are indeed a<br/>
breed apart.<br/>
