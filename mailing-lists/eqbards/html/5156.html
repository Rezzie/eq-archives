<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140524338">Roop and everyone else who feels this way:<br/>
I have a suggestion that may not solve anything but might be fun to try. Why<br/>
don&#39;t a bunch of you who are bored, tired of dweebs, camping, etc pick a<br/>
server together and start characters? I can tell many of you get along very<br/>
well, and I know it would be a pain to start a new character, but you know<br/>
what? It might be tons of fun and if you are bored to tears now, it can&#39;t<br/>
hurt huh?<br/>
A huge battalion of bards ;)<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought,<br/>
