<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085053718">I am a magnet too.  In Permafrost Keep I have the healer(whatever of the <br/>
healing type classes)in the party keep me at the top of their list, and I <br/>
request they keep enough mana for a heal at all times.  It seems no matter <br/>
how much damage/taunting others do...in am the center of attention.  In a <br/>
disorganized party, I am dead meat.  So if you plan to visit Permafrost, be <br/>
in a party and explain to them the advantages you bring to a party (if they <br/>
don&#39;t know) and tell them that you should not be the &quot;puller&quot; and that you <br/>
most likely will be the center of attention.<br/>

P.S. Lions like me too!  Always having to run from them!  I try not to kill <br/>
any cats because of faction, but they seem to want to play!  Hehe...for some <br/>
reason...</div>
