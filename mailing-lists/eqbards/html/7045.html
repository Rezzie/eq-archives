<div id="ygrps-yiv-195464234">I am about to start a new bard for a party of newbies me and my freinds<br/>
are going to make.  What would you guys reccomend?  Basically I have no<br/>
idea what stats are important for the bard...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m leaning towards Wood Elf, but could be sold on Human or half elf<br/>
too...  (I just like how wood elves look)<br/>
