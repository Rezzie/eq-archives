&gt;   I totally agree. There is NO secret nerfing going on. Do you question when<br/>
&gt; you hit for max damage in melee 5 times in a row? Then why the big fuss over<br/>
&gt; some missed notes? It happens, I think they have a name for it, bad luck?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Umm. Take a look at the people who are mentioning this the most. Mostly<br/>
40+ level players. Don&#39;t you think someone who had played the game long<br/>
enough to get to that level might just have _some_ feel for how often<br/>
you get a missed note by now? <br/>
