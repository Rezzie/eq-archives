<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191076559">There is/was a guide Bard on the Rathe server, I think he really was a bard<br/>
on his main toon because if I ever sent him a /petition saying that I<br/>
couldn&#39;t locate a body with my song he would respond within 15 sec. and come<br/>
look for himself. I also think he was the coolest guide in the program.<br/>
<br/>
Pinen bard of 30 songs&lt;retired&gt;<br/>
Maxius mage 45th level<br/>

from real vendors,</div>
