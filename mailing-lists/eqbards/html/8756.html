<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021055464">Hi all.  I have the components for both the lambent boots and the arms, but only one lambent<br/>
stone (since they&#39;re lore) and wondered which of these two to make first.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen the stats on the arms, but not on the boots.  Anyone know what they are?<br/>
