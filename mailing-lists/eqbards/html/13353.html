<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213605664">Possible, the bellow was hitting less than 20% (1/5 for math impaired,<br/>
we are bards after all) on DW crocs (red).  I was hitting near 100% on<br/>
DW caimans (say 90% maybe I remember a few resists) which conned yel or<br/>
red.  I got the &quot;[foo] winces&quot; message nearly every time.  I assume that<br/>
means its hitting, though you never get a damage report with discord.  I<br/>
would also sometimes even taunt the DW crocy off our tank (when we had<br/>
one) early in the fight with discord.<br/>
<br/>
Most wizas I know complain that DW crocs resist a great of their spells,<br/>
maybe they have some very high resistance (where bellow hits) and some<br/>
lower (where discord hits).  I&#39;m trying to think of some other critters<br/>
I can test on, but I&#39;d need some serious backup, since generally singing<br/>
AOE spells is not such a hot idea in a zone with reds...   Maybe some SG<br/>
hunters will let me tag along and see if I can hit something absurdly<br/>
red to me.<br/>
