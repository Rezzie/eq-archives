<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454513139">At level 20 I was looking ahead a song or two in the list at what I&#39;ll be<br/>
receiving soon.  ADM is up at 22nd.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;ve read on this list the my fellow bards have not been able to figure<br/>
out if Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody does anything of value.  I recall that<br/>
the discussion centered around the song &#39;not removing harmful effects or DoTs&#39;<br/>
or something to that effect.<br/>
<br/>
The title of the tune though is &quot;Disenchanting&quot;.  This implies to me that it<br/>
removes magical enchantment from *items*.  Since it is unlikely to remove the<br/>
MAGIC status of a weapon altogether, perhaps it removes &quot;procs&quot; that a weapon<br/>
might have.  Has anyone gone into an Arena, run ADM and seen if procing<br/>
weapons didn&#39;t proc on you?  Maybe a Staff of Writhing and a PGT against you<br/>
and ADM?<br/>
