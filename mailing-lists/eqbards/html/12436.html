&gt;Last night I was in a group in Highkeep and we got on the topic of dueling. <br/>
&gt;  got a message saying &#39;This NPC cannot be charmed.&#39; Dammit! NOOO!    I pop <br/>
&gt;back up and my opponents health bar is down (still grouped)<br/>

If you were to fight this magician again, you&#39;d have different results with <br/>
charm if you will disband from his group before battle. Most of our songs <br/>
either affect just party members or affect all non party members. Even <br/>
though Charm is a single target song, I&#39;d suspect that this would be the <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
I say this because I used charm in a duel against a warrior just a week or <br/>
so ago.<br/>
<br/>
Also, just for general usefulness, not being grouped with the person you are <br/>
dueling is a good idea even if that isn&#39;t the fix to your problem. That way <br/>
you only buff yourself.  Also, the AE songs we have won&#39;t affect those in <br/>
your group even if you are in duel mode or in the arena. I learned this in <br/>
my first duel when I was trying to test Disruptive Dischord many moons ago.<br/>
