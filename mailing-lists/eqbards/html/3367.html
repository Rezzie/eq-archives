<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025636994">I have the drum as well. Here&#39;s hard facts on the Mistmoore Battle Drum - same<br/>
weight (0.5) as a hand drum, but definitely gives some increase in speed over the<br/>
handdrum when using selo&#39;s, and a documentable feature would be when using either<br/>
Guardian or Elemental Rhythms it boosts resist by 5 points MORE than a handdrum.<br/>
<br/>
What exactly is this noticable effect you refer to with the Lute of the Gypsy<br/>
Princess? There is no difference at all with Hymn of Restoration, nor with any<br/>
other song as far as I can tell. I am Level 27. Feel free to quntify your<br/>
statement with something more useful then &quot;it does extra stuff&quot;.<br/>

&gt; well the lute does have an effect, and it is pretty noticeble. ditto with<br/>
&gt; the drums. I am pretty sure a lvl limit is in effect here though.<br/>
