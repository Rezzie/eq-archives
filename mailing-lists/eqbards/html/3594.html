<div id="ygrps-yiv-1305157280"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Walking speed is not just a direct proportion of running<br/>
&gt;speed.  Neither is encumbered speed for that matter.  The<br/>
&gt;faster your speed enhancement, the *greater* the enhancement<br/>
&gt;it has on walking speed and encumbered speed. e.g. Accelerando<br/>
&gt;with a drum is faster than SoW.  If you are encumbered, it is<br/>
&gt;even *more* faster than SoW (but still slower than being<br/>
&gt;unencumbered, though not by much).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like a classic case of taking a percent of a percent doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
