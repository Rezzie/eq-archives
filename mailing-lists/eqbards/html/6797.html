<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884820981">I have an idea regarding the Disenchant song.<br/>
<br/>
It does require a lute to play, which would imply its powerful. I&#39;m<br/>
thinking, perhaps if you play it during battle, it *prevents* certain<br/>
spells from hitting you. I&#39;ll have to test this, but its just a thought<br/>
before we all go making bug reports.<br/>
