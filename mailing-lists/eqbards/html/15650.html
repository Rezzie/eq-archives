<div id="ygrps-yiv-658745493">I just saw this posed on Eqvault by Gordon Wrinn:<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby Bugged?<br/>
[After reviewing some evidence posted on the thread] I spoke to Geoff about<br/>
the original author&#39;s tests. It looks like there might be *something*<br/>
strange going on, but we&#39;ll have to run some more tests in House. Geoff will<br/>
take another look at it after he gets done with the first draft of the<br/>
expansion spells in the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
Well done everyone who posted evidence, they are at least taking another<br/>
look at this song.<br/>
I just hope they can un-nerf it as well as they nerfed it.<br/>
