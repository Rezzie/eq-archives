<div id="ygrps-yiv-182064765">I played beta for a while but just couldn&#39;t get into it.  In a way I&#39;m glad,<br/>
because I&#39;m having a great time in EQ.  My Bard is 56 now, working on the<br/>
epic and I&#39;ve been recruited into a fairly high level guild.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of new and exciting adventures await... it&#39;s given me a new lease of<br/>
life in the game.<br/>
