Eldrig was my hardest piece.  took me a week every day in skyfire to get<br/>
him.  i hardly ever actually hunted for him.  i showed up every day, let the<br/>
zone know i needed him, and asked a member of each group there to let me<br/>
know if they saw him.  a lot of regulars there so i became known during that<br/>
week, and finally i get a tell one night that he was up.  booked over there<br/>
and nailed him.<br/>

&gt; I was in skyfire the other night trying to get Eldrig to spawn.  The <br/>
&gt; question I have is if he is on the same cycle as Black Scar, and the <br/>
&gt; other named ones?  Seems like black scar, and some other named <br/>
&gt; chromodrac spanwed every time.  Is Eldrig just rare?  (Like the lava <br/>
&gt; walkder?)  Or is there some other trick to get him to spawn?<br/>
