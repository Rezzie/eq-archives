&gt; Is this possible?  Are you PVP as soon as you get into the arena?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can be bound anywhere in the Arena zone.  The PvP area<br/>
does not start until you enter the stadium.  Everything<br/>
outside of it is no-PvP.  (There seem to be sections inside<br/>
which are no-PvP as well, but I&#39;ll leave investigating those<br/>
as an exercise for the reader.)<br/>
