<div id="ygrps-yiv-968423476">If you drop a lore item that is in a container, it will disappear from the<br/>
container.<br/>
<br/>
If you drop a lore item by itself, you will be able to pick it back up<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Motto: Don&#39;t keep really nice lore items in containers because you may drop<br/>
them.<br/>
