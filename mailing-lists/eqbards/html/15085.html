<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-456432734">So I assume Gordon is referring to the level 47 song Niv&#39;s Melody of<br/>
Preservation when he says go visit your song vendors?  Any found this yet?<br/>
<br/>
Also I have been wanting to get a hero bracer for months and I read that it<br/>
is possible you have to kill meldrath and his two mino guards to get the<br/>
hero to spawn, is this true?  I have spent a great deal of time running<br/>
around the gears killing potential placeholders but have never gotten him to<br/>
spawn.  Additionally, I have read the hero is level 35 - does anyone think<br/>
it is possible to solo him at level 40 or does he hit like a giant?<br/>
<br/>
Questions question...<br/>
