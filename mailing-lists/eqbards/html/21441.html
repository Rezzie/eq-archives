<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683725057">A while back there was a post or two about navigating L.Guk.  My guild is going there soon (maybe as soon<br/>
as tonight) and I can&#39;t find the post.  Guess I didn&#39;t save it?  Did anyone else?  I am specifically<br/>
referring to how to get into/out of the Ass/Sup room quietly (since I assume it will be camped when we get<br/>
there and am hoping folks will be kind enough to let me loot the Mask).<br/>
