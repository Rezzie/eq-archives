Well honestly, the nerfs to Donals are NOT justified, in my opinion, because<br/>
they have stated that many of the Velious mobs were designed with those BPs<br/>
in mind.  They hit for ungodly amounts and quickly and have insane amouts of<br/>
HP themselves like 200k.  If they downscale these mobs then maybe I would<br/>
support the nerf but if not, well the increase in CR time alone will begin<br/>
to make the game unpalatable to me.  But then I&#39;m in a bad mood today :P<br/>
