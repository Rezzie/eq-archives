<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005736993">I am so sorry this had to happen to you.  I know your pain.  This happened<br/>
to me in November.  I was very lucky to belong to a good Guild who  helped<br/>
me through it and replaced my stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It surprised me to hear Madagan say that he heard of someone being banned<br/>
for this.  At the time of my looting, Guides/GMs were unable to do anything<br/>
for me even though my guild mates hunted him down that day and got him to<br/>
confess and /reported the confession.  The perpetrator is still at large on<br/>
my server and it irks me everytime I run across him.<br/>
<br/>
You are not an idiot, you probably just want to see the potential good in<br/>
people.  I have to admit, though, I am much less willing to trust others<br/>
since my incident.<br/>
