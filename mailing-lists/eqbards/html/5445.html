<div id="ygrps-yiv-257532524">I want to thank all the people posting the great stories today, I really <br/>
needed a good laugh.  I have no great story myself to add (as I was running <br/>
all over Tunaria last night looking for medium quality animal skins to <br/>
practice tailoring on).  But I did hear a funny joke in West Karana:<br/>
A guy kills a named Barbarian in WK and shouts out &quot;What is a barbarian head <br/>
good for?&quot;<br/>
Someone answers, &quot;Nothing, they do not even use them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Keep up the great stories everyone!<br/>
