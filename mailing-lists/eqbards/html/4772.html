<b>Subject:</b> Upgrading armor <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-589161533">Recently, I have started upgrading my armor. I lack steel plate helm and<br/>
boots for all the visual slots. The rest I will fill with stat increasing<br/>
items.  However, I have several pieces of equipment I need to sell and have<br/>
NO IDEA what they are worth in cash. I have no interest in trading for items<br/>
as I will be in the same boat I am now.  Cash is what I need so please<br/>
respond with the cash value of items listed.  I understand different servers<br/>
may have different economics, and will keep that in mind.<br/>
<br/>
1. Blackened Iron Crown (yes, i know its cool, but i want to cover my ugly<br/>
mug with a nice plate helm)<br/>
2. Drake Hide Leggings<br/>
3. Blackened Iron Tunic<br/>
4. Bladed Thulian Claws (i love these things, but have changed over to blunt<br/>
weapons)<br/>
<br/>
thx<br/>
