<div id="ygrps-yiv-529164251">Did the Bracer of Erollissi change in stats?  I could have sworn it used to<br/>
be AC2 but now its AC5.  Anything other items of note change besides<br/>
Lionskin gloves getting a ho-hum +2 resistance vs. cold bonus?  For the 10pp<br/>
plus HQ Lion skin they require these things are a joke.<br/>
