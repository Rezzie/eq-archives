Well thank you finally!! Everyone had been so anxious about telling me this <br/>
and that and it slipped (conveniently?) our minds to touch on that subject. <br/>
It&#39;s useless triva knowledge, I know, but I&#39;ve always been good for that <br/>
sort of thing while chatting away in groups between battles or even within <br/>
the guild. Thank you Galeras!!<br/>
