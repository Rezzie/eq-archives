offering them the first couple days, but it&#39;s slowly died down<br/>
as more people figure this out.<br/>

The icy greaves are worse than normal plate, but have the blue<br/>
color of lambent.  I expect they&#39;ll become popular too, as it<br/>
gives a nice &quot;blue jeans&quot; effect when combined with normal<br/>
armor.<br/>
