<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003251978">GZ TO DISCUSS BARDS<br/>
Abashi has put up a thread on the Everquest Hybrid Forum to allow Bard&#39;s to<br/>
pose questions to GZ to be answered in the next Arch-Mage answers. Questions<br/>
close on Thursday afternoon.<br/>
 <br/>
Hadn&#39;t seen any questions from this board&#39;s members here as of yet, so<br/>
thought I&#39;d remind everyone about this thread.<br/>
