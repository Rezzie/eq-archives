<div id="ygrps-yiv-512222473">Now that pets are treated as PCs instead of NPCs when it comes to procing, I<br/>
was wondering if its possible that they may now be affected by bard songs<br/>
(whether intentional or unintentional on Verant&#39;s part).  I haven&#39;t grouped<br/>
with a pet class since the patch that changed pets went in so I haven&#39;t been<br/>
able to test this for myself.  If there are affected by bard songs now, I<br/>
would think the easiest way to confirm it is to sing Hymn or Mana song and<br/>
see if they are surrounded by blue particles.  Has anyone tried this yet?<br/>
