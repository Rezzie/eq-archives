<br/>
&gt; Mr. Schafer, you are quite possibly doing yourself a great disservice by not<br/>
&gt; cycling songs at your level.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cycling Hymn is rather pointless at that level range, but there are so many<br/>
&gt; more options for you, and they continue to grow.  As I stated in a post last<br/>
&gt; week, a bard that doesn&#39;t cycle is like a warrior who refuses to wear plate<br/>
&gt; and use 2h weapons, or a wizard that refuses to memorize spells, a ranger<br/>
&gt; that doesn&#39;t track, a paladin that doesn&#39;t lay hands, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the clarification J.M. Seeing as this is the case, do you know<br/>
if there&#39;s any hope from Verant to make it less of a constant twitch<br/>
motion? For example, by making it so you can have an instrument slot (like<br/>
a ranged slot), where you switch between weapons and instrument without<br/>
popping things between slots? Of course, you&#39;d still have to do some<br/>
inventory switching to change weapons.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
