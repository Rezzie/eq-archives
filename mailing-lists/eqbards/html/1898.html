<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403752144">I am fairly new to bard-dom (Having been a warrior in a previous life).<br/>
After reading this list, I have one big question...What exactly is<br/>
twisting/weaving/stacking/combing songs? Is this just a matter of quickly<br/>
switching between several different songs? What are some of the better<br/>
combos? Thanks for any and all info...<br/>
