<div id="ygrps-yiv-846975694">Once I sing my mana-using song, can I then go to my songbook and forget this<br/>
song and memorize another one?  And then once my mana regenerates on it&#39;s<br/>
own over the next 30-60 minutes,  rememorize  the song to be able to use it<br/>
again?  This seems to be the best way to take advantage of this song.<br/>
