<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348643707">Well last night many servers crashed around 11:30 PM East Coast time.<br/>
<br/>
We all got booted off Veeshan (The server was listed as DOWN, so I assume<br/>
everyone got booted, when i finally was able to log on, about 400 people<br/>
were online).  Also many other servers appeared to have gone down also<br/>
(listed as DOWN or had very few people online).<br/>
<br/>
I wonder...</div>
