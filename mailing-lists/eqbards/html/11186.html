 </span></blockquote>I think something needs to be done.  Unfortunately, Verant doesnt have the <br/>
market cornered on treating its customers like crap.  3do did the same thing <br/>
with M59.  I remember server 105 being deliberately crashed by the players <br/>
til 3do listened to our complaints.  Not that I&#39;m advocating crashing any <br/>
servers here, but sometimes you have to &quot;get their attention&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to think if we don&#39;t get Verant&#39;s attention regarding bard <br/>
issues, we will continue to be ignored, to our detriment.  I&#39;m not a rabble <br/>
rouser for the most part, but we do have legitmate issues that are not being <br/>
addressed by Verant.  The final straw for me was when Verant didnt even know <br/>
our level 22 song was broken and had been for months, despite being put in <br/>
feedback all that time.<br/>
