<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796274183">That&#39;s what I was finding, too.  If I got anywhere near a Drachnid without<br/>
it actually aggro&#39;ing on me or me taking a swipe at it, sooner or later I&#39;d<br/>
get a bad faction message.  Mayong really loves me now. ;)<br/>

We were getting them near the Sarnak fortress in Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
We petitioned, and the guide said if a sarnak even looked at you, you<br/>
got on its aggro list -- and thus got faction hits</div>
