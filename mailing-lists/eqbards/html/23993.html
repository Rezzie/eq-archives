<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754996761">Outdoor pulling is no problem, when grabbing wandering mobs, but correct me<br/>
if I&#39;m wrong, but we are *not* dungeon pullers, correct?  As in, pulling one<br/>
mob out of many.  <br/>
<br/>
I refuse to pull in Dalnir&#39;s now.  Last time I tried, the first lull on the<br/>
first mob was resisted...and it took the long way around to get me.  So many<br/>
casters, I was dead faster than I could warn the group.  With that less than<br/>
stellar record, even contemplating trying to lull 2 or 3 before pulling 1 is<br/>
less than appealing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;m missing anything, but just wanted to check here, and make<br/>
sure.  :)<br/>
