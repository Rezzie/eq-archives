<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913356812">As best I can tell they do stack.  I hunt my druid and bard together<br/>
alot, and it seems I regen mana somewhat quicker on the druid with both<br/>
songs twisted together.<br/>
<br/>
	If I have time over the weekend, I will do an objective test of<br/>
Clarity alone, Clarity(2 pulses) twisted with Cantana (1 pulse), and Cantana<br/>
alone as they affect regen of a full bar of Mana on my lvl 47 druid.<br/>
