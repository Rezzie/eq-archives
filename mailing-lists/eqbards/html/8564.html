<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424194777"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Now, I&#39;m just talking about taking damage - sure, bards can use songs to<br/>
&gt;counter their disadvantages. But, my point is that better armor will not<br/>
&gt;make a bard a better tank than a warrior of equal level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, what I was trying to say is that a bard in better armor will only<br/>
last a few more rounds than normal, they would still die when compared to a<br/>
warrior is worse armor who would live, for exactly the reasons you<br/>
mentioned.</div>
