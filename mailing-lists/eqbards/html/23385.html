<div id="ygrps-yiv-7708895">I have been using Sinoche&#39;s Partisan and still have no agro trouble when I<br/>
melee.  To be honest I only have agro trouble if I am doing the triple chant<br/>
attack (I pull mobs off our 52 warrior with that), or if I am doing double<br/>
regen song with Gypsy Lute...</div>
