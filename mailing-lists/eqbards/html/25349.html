As for other &#39;Easter eggs&#39;, as they are often called, I recently ran<br/>
across the following site:<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/easterquest.htm">http://amtgard.pinkpig.com/everquest/easterquest.htm</a>&gt;. It claims to<br/>
have uncovered all sorts of hidden meanings and word arrangements in the<br/>
game... that said, I certainly can&#39;t vouch as to whether any of it&#39;s<br/>
really true or merely coincidence :)<br/>
