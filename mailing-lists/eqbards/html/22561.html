<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698518155">I am frequently in a group with a cleric and a druid. The cleric<br/>
roots and heals, druid DOTS, sows and roots if cleric is agroed, and I pull<br/>
and chant.<br/>
<br/>
	Great thing about this is that no one is getting continually<br/>
pounded, so there is no down-time.<br/>
<br/>
	Great tactic in the late 40&#39;s -early 50&#39;s in the Dreadlands and<br/>
Burning Woods.<br/>
