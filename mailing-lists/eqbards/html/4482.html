&gt;didn&#39;t kill it, my paladin and cleric friends did saying that<br/>
&gt;necromancers deserved to die, and as a bard I got hit with the<br/>
&gt;faction loss).  I lost faction with &quot;class 41.&quot;<br/>

  That&#39;s apparently a holdover from pre-beta when they didn&#39;t have faction<br/>
names for every faction.  Somehow that Gnome slipped through the bars ;)<br/>
