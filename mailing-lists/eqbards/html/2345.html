&gt;sit back and eat some raman.  Perhaps you&#39;ll get lucky and someone will <br/>
&gt;come<br/>
&gt;to hunt there.  Try calling out to people to get the LOC of a dock, then<br/>
&gt;head for it.  Now truthfully, you shouldn&#39;t be that far from the first dock<br/>
&gt;at all.  Unless you swim past it.<br/>

bacon and probably maxed my swimming skill at the same time :)<br/>
