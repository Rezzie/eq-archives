<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102812382">I now know more than I ever wanted to know about SCSI chains,<br/>
hi/lo byte, termination, and what all these (misused)<br/>
SCSI/fast/ultra/SCSI-2/SCSI-3/LVD terms mean.  Good news is<br/>
everything is fixed and so far it seems to be more stable than<br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
I also had a small problem with stormhaven.org&#39;s sshd<br/>
using an RSA key greater than 1024-bits, while none of the ssh<br/>
binaries I could find were compiled to handle that (seems they<br/>
changed the path on the primary ftp site, and all the mirrors<br/>
broke).  That prevented me from getting to my email from work.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and there was this little thing called Thanksgiving too.  <br/>
Hope everyone had a great holiday.  Now to get all my software<br/>
reinstalled...<br/>
