<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310016475">That must be something that happens as you age, right now Healing (lvl<br/>
14) heals around 100 hp and Daring buffs around 75.  They are both 60<br/>
mana.  I&#39;m not sure about the cast time, though i think they are<br/>
similar... In any case Daring had almost no recycle time anyway, it was<br/>
Spirit Armor that had the long recycle time...<br/>
