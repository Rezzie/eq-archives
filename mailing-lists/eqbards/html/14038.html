<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454764775">Tested it against a L4 snake.  154 charisma, lute equipped.<br/>
<br/>
415 pulses of the song<br/>
 10 ( 2.4%) outright resists<br/>
193 (46.5%) secondary resists<br/>
212 (51.1%) successful nods<br/>
<br/>
GZ said at the level difference between a L35 bard and L1 mob,<br/>
the rate of the secondary resists should be 25%, modified by<br/>
charisma.  Maybe they got the sign on the charisma modifier<br/>
wrong, and instead of secondary resists being 25%-20%=5%,<br/>
they&#39;re getting 25%+20% = 45%?<br/>
<br/>
I also verified what Kitasi claimed.  Lullaby does NOT work<br/>
like Pixie Strike, where a secondary resist on an already<br/>
nodded mob will keep it slept.  Both an outright resist or a<br/>
secondary resist results in the mob waking up and attacking<br/>
you.<br/>
