beating on you the entire trip to the zone.  Invis just<br/>
insures any extra mobs I run past won&#39;t immediately latch on<br/>
to me.<br/>

Oh, wait I see what you&#39;re saying.  No, you don&#39;t stand next<br/>
to the charmed mob waiting for the invis to take effect.  :)  <br/>
You equip the flute, start the song, and immediately begin to<br/>
run.<br/>
<br/>
The other option is to chain the mob that&#39;s chasing you.  <br/>
Charm however can usually tie up 2-3 mobs while you get away.<br/>
