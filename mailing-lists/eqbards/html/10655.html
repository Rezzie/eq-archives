<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590475142">I was experimenting with the baking skill the other day..  I bought a spit<br/>
and noticed something!  This spit is very light, Less than a pound (i think<br/>
.2 weight?  I cant remember) And it has 6 spots for holding stuff..  Im<br/>
thinking about getting all spits for my inv spots cuz my backpacks are heavy<br/>
with my bronze = ^_^ =<br/>
