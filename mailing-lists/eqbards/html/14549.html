<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-23711187">I am a lvl 12 bardess in Prexus (the most sexy one...), i would like to<br/>
know what should I get with the 150pp I have in bank. I though about a new<br/>
weapon(still using a FS scimitar), but I dont know what would the best<br/>
weapon for that price be. I will probably get a barbed leather whip from a<br/>
friend, so I may also get some other kind of equipment... Please send me<br/>
some advice on what should I get. right now I am wearing the following:<br/>
<br/>
FS scimitar<br/>
Shinny B Shield<br/>
Dwarven Ring Tunic<br/>
Banded legs, arms, shoulder, cape, cap...<br/>
Purity Belt<br/>
Spiked collar<br/>
elf hide gloves<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot<br/>
Ericka. The sexyest bardess in Prexus :)</div>
