<div id="ygrps-yiv-161655031">I was highly impressed with Mindspring&#39;s dialup service.  Were the <br/>
     throughput of my cable modem not so much better, I would still be <br/>
     dialing up, because Mindsprings packet loss was consistently less than <br/>
     1%...<br/>
     <br/>
     Meanwhile, @home&#39;s packet loss is... lets call it &#39;special&#39;... I just <br/>
     haven&#39;t been able to make myself go back to regular old slow surfing <br/>
     speeds though... &lt;shrug&gt;<br/>

That&#39;s what I figured.  That&#39;s why it takes me 30-45 minutes to get to Paw <br/>
from Qeynos without a drum.  My conection sux.  Can I get some isp <br/>
suggestions from the other bards out there?  Even though I live in a <br/>
metropolitan suburb, my neighborhood doesn&#39;t have DSL or cable modems <br/>
available yet.  My current isp is...AOL.  I tried AT&T but the ping was even <br/>
worse than my usual 500 or so.  You can send suggestions to me directly at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Dean_Kimes@...">Dean_Kimes@...</a> to avoid spamming the list.  Thanks!!!<br/>
