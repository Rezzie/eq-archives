<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483473202">Strange, I was thinking it was odd over the last 2 days (even before the<br/>
patch) that I seemed to be getting MORE missed notes in general on all my<br/>
songs that I usually do.  I can&#39;t really think of anything to attribute this<br/>
to logically but I definitely did not notice less missed notes :-(<br/>

&gt; i tried fufil&#39;s also (did not try either tuyen&#39;s song) and <br/>
&gt; all i got was 3<br/>
&gt; ticks of 10dmg and -14 magic resistance.  no change with <br/>
&gt; mistmoore battle<br/>
&gt; drum.  from what i remember this is exactly what it was <br/>
&gt; pre-patch.  oh well.<br/>
&gt; along with that and no breastplate a pretty disappointing day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, I almost forgot too... anyone notice less missed notes?  <br/>
&gt; i started,<br/>
&gt; stopped, and restarted the level 50 song 10 times with no <br/>
&gt; missed notes.  i<br/>
&gt; was only confirming what another 50 bard noticed.  that would <br/>
&gt; be impossible<br/>
&gt; pre-patch, that song missed notes more than not.  so one good <br/>
&gt; thing at least<br/>
