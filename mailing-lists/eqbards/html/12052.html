<div id="ygrps-yiv-599439240">We&#39;re making the same point.  People said that Druids and Shamans were<br/>
the &quot;Jack of all trades&quot;  I was saying that they really can&#39;t back that<br/>
up since they can&#39;t melee at a decent level.  I was being flippant with<br/>
the pretend comment.<br/>
<br/>
I think bards melee is strong enough offensivly, just comes in a little<br/>
short on the recieving damage end.  Then again if we could tank better,<br/>
that would hardly be fair to the other melee types who don&#39;t get any (OR<br/>
as much) magic.  We don&#39;t get a kick or bash, but could you imagine<br/>
trying to weave that into the whole triple woven song button mash?<br/>
