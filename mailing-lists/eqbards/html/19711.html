<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230495871">I finally completed my Lambent armor last night. (Yea me!) Now, my question<br/>
is what should I get for my other armor slots. I am 27th level so I am<br/>
looking for items I can get. What should I have in my earrings, rings, neck,<br/>
shoulders, back and waist slots?<br/>
