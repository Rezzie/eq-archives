<div id="ygrps-yiv-154113903">I didn&#39;t.  I spent 30 minutes at 5:30pm Pacific trying to log into Veeshan<br/>
<br/>
At 6:03pm Pacific on Veeshan I did /movelog yes<br/>
at 6:04pm Pacific on Veeshan I bid all my friends goodbye who were on<br/>
at 6:35pm Pacific on Veeshan I camped out<br/>
at 6:40pm Pacific I logged into Tallon Zek and played my dark elf<br/>
Shadowknight for several hours.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to get any more xp on Veeshan since I may lose a bunch of it<br/>
when they move the backup files to a new server.<br/>
