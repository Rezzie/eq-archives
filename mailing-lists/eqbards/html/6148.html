<div id="ygrps-yiv-103799739">The banded donut-head look actually looks kinda cute on my half-elf female.<br/>
It&#39;s not too bad on the males either in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
The bronze looks absolutely stupid (I personally don&#39;t even like the color)<br/>
and I intend to skip over it entirely due to the weight primarily, but also<br/>
because of the look.<br/>
