If you stick to the wall, they will not attack.  There&#39;s also<br/>
a chance they won&#39;t &quot;see&quot; you if you run by really quickly<br/>
(which is what I did by accident my first time, and what got<br/>
me killed my second time when I tried it again :).  See<br/>
Kitasi&#39;s posts on how aggro checks might be pulsed instead of<br/>
continuous.  (I also have a theory on this, but I&#39;m not going<br/>
to post it since it may be abusable - need to test it and send<br/>
it to Verant.)<br/>
