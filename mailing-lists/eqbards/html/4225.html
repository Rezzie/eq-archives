<div id="ygrps-yiv-916823824">Ok, just a few words.....Learning, no matter what, is never truly a bad thing...they say ignorance is bliss, but its goddamed boring also. If you have a problem with acronyms, just do what I do when I have a problem with something in the game...IGNORE IT...What you cant see cant hurt you, so to speak (Purely in terms of text, not the spectre behind you sucking your will to live)<br/>
And, as with any profession, acronyms make things easier. I ride on an ambulance, and its so much easier, and better for the patient to ask for a full set of vitals, which include BP, LE, PMS, HR, and plenty of other things....we could easily ask each other for blood pressures, Lung expansions, pulse motor sensorys and hear rates, to name a few, but its easier and better just to use the acronyms...</div>
