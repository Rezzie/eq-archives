<div id="ygrps-yiv-966584062">I think you are forgetting the recent PvP spell changes. At least when I<br/>
tested this previous to them, it did 30hp. And yes, when I tested it, a<br/>
drum made absolutely no difference either. Unfortunately, due to the<br/>
dual effect nature of the songs I found them rarely worth the slot for<br/>
memorizing. The resist rate was just too high. If one in 2 takes not<br/>
only have you wasted 2 song pulses but you would have been better off<br/>
using bellow.<br/>

&gt; I guess it is easy enough to find out what the effects are...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ok, just tested: cast on self hp dropped from 786 to 765 and dropped MR from<br/>
&gt; 51 to 41.  No enhancement with a drum equipped.  So thats 21 dmg on an even<br/>
&gt; con.<br/>
