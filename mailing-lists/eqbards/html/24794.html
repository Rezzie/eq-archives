<div id="ygrps-yiv-287420306"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Nothing was charmed - was always hostile and hitting hard.  There was no<br/>
&gt; message of mez wearing off - it just wouldn&#39;t stick for a while - and then<br/>
&gt; the mob was down some hit points when I finally WAS able to mez it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think the AOE theory makes the most sense.  Perhaps I was able to mez it<br/>
&gt; after it burned through its mana..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If it was doing this (which I dont think is possible) you would get a mez<br/>
has worn off message...<br/>
