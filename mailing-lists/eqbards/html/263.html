other classes, whose primary purpose is to help one another and others.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t run a business at a reasonable profit, but<br/>
members of the guild should be known for acts of generosity and kindness<br/>
rather than arrogance and self serving.  No reflection on other guilds<br/>
intended.<br/>
<br/>
The idea would be that anyone seeing the name of that guild would know the<br/>
bearer could be trusted implicitly and appealed to for possible help.  I&#39;d<br/>
like to see it allow worthies of other classes and any race, but maintain a<br/>
flavor of bardic oversight and origination.  It should have relatively<br/>
independent chapters on all servers where people of good will wanted to<br/>
join.  The only membership fee is a pledge, well-kept, to good will and<br/>
honorable behavior.<br/>
<br/>
We could name it, say, &quot;Song of &lt;something&gt;&quot;  like Harmony, Service, Aid,<br/>
or such.  I like &quot;Song of Service.&quot;  If you&#39;re in trouble, call out SoS.  :-)}<br/>
