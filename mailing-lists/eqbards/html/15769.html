<div id="ygrps-yiv-889584120">Okay, so I&#39;ve got some good suggestions for where - now how about some <br/>
HOWs?  I mean, I&#39;ve nearly got the hang of 3-song weaving, (I&#39;m too <br/>
unreliable on 4) - do you recommend that or melee?  Also, is there any <br/>
equipment I should have or should start looking for?<br/>
