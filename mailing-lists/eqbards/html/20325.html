<div id="ygrps-yiv-502124156">So I was hanging with my group the other day and the topic of conversation<br/>
wandered to hit points.<br/>
<br/>
What did I learn?<br/>
<br/>
Me, Bard, no buffs. Level 45, 1140 ish hp.<br/>
Friend, Wizard, self buffed, level 49, 1220 hp.<br/>
<br/>
I do have the AC edge, but isn&#39;t this a bit ridiculous? I know he has 4<br/>
levels on me, but still, EVERY other hybrid my level has easily 4-500 hp<br/>
more than me.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>
