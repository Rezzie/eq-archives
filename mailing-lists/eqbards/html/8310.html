<div id="ygrps-yiv-638290521">Does anyone else here enjoy living vicariously through Shada and enjoy seeing the:<br/>
<br/>
Shada D&#39;ukal, Level 50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>
Erisi Dlarit, Level 24 High Elf Paladin<br/>
Tyria Sarkin, Level 22 High Elf Wizard<br/>
Manda, Level 11 Wood Elf Warrior<br/>
<br/>
I started reading the list when Shada was in the 40&#39;s and it&#39;s been fun watching Shada and other people&#39;s progress.  I&#39;m just hoping this weekend I can get 26th and try the ever so often mentioned &quot;fear/chain combo.&quot;<br/>
