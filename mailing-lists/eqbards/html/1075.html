&gt;1) Acually, Paladins get Double Attack, but not Dual Wield. It&#39;s still true<br/>
&gt;that only a warrior has both.<br/>

warrior-only thing.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It just doesn&#39;t fit my idea of the classic bard. We are seldom portrayed as<br/>
&gt;tanks. We are singers of songs. Maybe even lifters of purses or players of<br/>
&gt;practical jokes. Light on our feet and quick about our wits.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My idea of a bard is someone who goes out and gets into a grand adventure,<br/>
then comes home and tells great stories about the battle, and sings songs<br/>
commemorating the victory.  I do not see any pickpocketing or jokeplaying in<br/>
my future.  So I will want to wear platemail, while you won&#39;t.<br/>

&gt;I also bought my combine longsword for 52.5pp and my charisma is 90.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That sucks.  My CHA is 110 and I get the same price.  I keep thinking that I<br/>
wasted 20 skill points at character creation time.<br/>
