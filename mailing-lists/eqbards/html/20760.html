<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444054892">That is the bug &quot;that doesn&#39;t exist&quot;.  For some reason, when you level and<br/>
before you max your skill your fizzle rate increases.  THis is obvious for<br/>
your new songs/spells, but it definitly occurs for songs/spells you have<br/>
been casting for a long time with no trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed it while playing my cleric and asked my roomate and friends to<br/>
watch for it too.  They all see the same effect with their casters.  It<br/>
seems to be the same for Elfson (my bard) though it doesnt bother me as much<br/>
since all you lose is time (not mana)...</div>
