&gt; I think I see what you were saying now.  When I died at 30th level, the EXP<br/>
&gt; bar didn&#39;t drop very much.  I still lost the same amount of EXP I did when I<br/>
&gt; died at 29-, it just wasn&#39;t as noticeable because it takes so much extra EXP<br/>
&gt; to get thru those levels.  When you died at 47 and dropped to 46, your EXP<br/>
&gt; bar decreased a full bubble into 46.  Had you died at 46 with only a few<br/>
&gt; pixels to go before making 47th, you would only have lost maybe a 1/4<br/>
&gt; bub(normal EXP loss).  So in effect, when you died at 47 and dropped a full<br/>
&gt; bub into 46, you got penalized more than you should have.  Is that what you<br/>
&gt; were pointing out?<br/>

When I died at 47, I only lost a half bubble into 46.  All my<br/>
friends who died at 46 said they lost over a bubble. That<br/>
indicates the exp loss at 47 is less than the exp loss at 46.<br/>
<br/>
When I died at 31, I lost a half bubble into 30.  When I died<br/>
at 30, I lost a quarter bubble.  That indicates the exp loss<br/>
at 31 is more than the exp loss at 30.<br/>
<br/>
Both of these indicate the exp loss at (hell level+1) is<br/>
greater than at other levels.<br/>
