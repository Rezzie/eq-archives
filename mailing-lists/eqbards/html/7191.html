<b>Subject:</b> New Sneak info? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378080874">Can anyone verify the new information that our Sneak cap has been raised?<br/>
Also, if sneak has been raised above 40 (one listmember reports a current<br/>
skill of 61) has Hide also been raised as well? Any others?  This is<br/>
fabulous news if we can verify it to be true.<br/>
<br/>
I am also excited for Tuesday&#39;s patch, the ability to rearrange spells in<br/>
our spellbook is great!<br/>
