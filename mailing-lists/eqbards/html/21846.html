it&#39;s the same thing.  yeah there may be a &#39;&#39;perfect group&#39;&#39; template, but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
happen a whole lot.  what i bring to a group is the ability to make a group that<br/>
doesn&#39;t fit that perfect template workable, yeah, maybe not quite as efficiently<br/>
as an enchanter might or a shaman might or a ranger might, but we kill stuff,<br/>
it&#39;s fun, and no one gets killed.</div>
