To borrow a theme from Star Trek, I could lend Melodii some<br/>
platinum FO rings (5AC +55hp), but then I&#39;d feel obliged to<br/>

This is supposed to be a fun event, not some bloodthirsty<br/>
winner-takes-all tournament.  Go there, do your best with what<br/>
you have, and have fun.  If you lose, no big deal.  If you<br/>
win, you&#39;ll be happier knowing you did it through sheer<br/>
ingenuity and not because you got twinked.<br/>
