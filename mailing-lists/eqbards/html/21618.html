<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284733216">I&#39;ve done this before, and the problem with it is that it&#39;s highly <br/>
inefficient.  Charm kiting is much more effective, and even regular <br/>
kiting is better because a charmed mob has a greatly increased regen <br/>
rate, so you&#39;re fighting that.  I would say that with decent weapons, <br/>
fear kiting is even more efficient than this.<br/>
