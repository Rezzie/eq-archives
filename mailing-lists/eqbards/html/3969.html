<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607768203">Is there any way we can get some confirmation about the minotaur horn&#39;s<br/>
usage?  I have heard from some that it is only Wind, and now we have someone<br/>
who claims it also works for Brass...can anyone confirm this?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I also have a question on this:  can you use the mino horn to raise the <br/>
brass skill?  Currently my brass is maxed for my level, but I&#39;ve been <br/>
lugging around a brass instrument just for this purpose, would be nice if I <br/>
could sell it back to the vendor.<br/>
<br/>
I did try the song with the mino horn, and it does work.  But I&#39;m not sure <br/>
if its because I&#39;m singing it while just holding the horn, or if I&#39;m <br/>
actually using the horn.<br/>
