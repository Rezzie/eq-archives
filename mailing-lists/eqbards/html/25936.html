<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-549963159">Finally made the run to Katta to get my new songs.  I got them all even <br/>
though some (magical monologue, sustaining song) seem completely useless to <br/>
me at this level.<br/>
<br/>
Amplification, wow.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone change up their lineup to make this song more useful?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve heard now that chorus of clarity and Soothing stack...<br/>
<br/>
And that if you restart crack a bunch of times it stacks on itself?<br/>
<br/>
Any comments? Any experience?<br/>
<br/>
What are your favorite haste/melee buff songs and do any of them work with <br/>
amplification?<br/>
<br/>
Very curious to hear wht ya&#39;ll have to say.<br/>
