<div id="ygrps-yiv-1143564548"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Bzzzz, wrong answer.  40 or 41 are both crappy songs.<br/>
&gt; 40 is single target dispell which doesn&#39;t work and 41<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Uhh I LOVE Disenchanting Aria!  (40) and it&#39;s AWESOME.  I use it to drop<br/>
damage shields ALL the time.  Our enchanters never bother memming dispel if<br/>
I have this loaded.  It&#39;s a fantastic song and I find it extremely useful in<br/>
any dungeon with casters that throw damage shields or buffs of any kind on<br/>
mobs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is a psalm of something I believe (yep, confirmed it<br/>
&gt; on the song analysis page).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I find that the only psalms I use are warmth, cooling and the two with<br/>
&quot;cure&quot; components.  And those I use VERY rarely.  For the most part the only<br/>
really useful psalms are warmth and cooling (though the anti-poison psalm is<br/>
nice vs Maestro and other Lifetap/Poison mobs).  I have yet to run into a<br/>
disease based attack that really makes me feel it necessary to load up the<br/>
other psalm.</div>
