me, saying, &quot;You will not escape me so easily,<br/>
Daddy00!  More stories!!!&quot;  My second attempt<br/>
appeared to work, but just as I was running away<br/>
(down the stairs) the mob woke up and began<br/>
attacking me again, &quot;Daddy00, I&#39;m scared of the<br/>
fire alarm!&quot;  Again, I fired up Lullaby.  Again,<br/>
the mob appeared to nod off, and I actually almost<br/>
made it to the zone, when it woke up again.  I ran<br/>
back up the stairs to avoid aggroing anything<br/>
else, and Lullabied again.  Only this final one<br/>
stuck.  Now that&#39;s only one out of four attempts,<br/>
for an overal resist rate of 75%!  I think this is<br/>
intolerable, and I may have to stop playing EQ if<br/>
Verant doesn&#39;t fix this obvious nerf.<br/>
