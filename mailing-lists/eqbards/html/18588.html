<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595866346">To the young Aussie bard who just joined us (sorry, deleted the message and<br/>
I forget your name):<br/>
<br/>
You may run into the same problem with guilds that I have.  I found a great<br/>
guild, one that suits my playstyle and attitude.  But almost all of the<br/>
guild members are on the US West coast and don&#39;t log in until I&#39;m logging<br/>
out.  Making things more difficult is that the 4 or 5 that play the same<br/>
hours I do are either Iksars or 10+ levels higher than me.  Part of my<br/>
reason for wanting to join a guild was to make grouping easier.  If this is<br/>
a concern of yours then you might be better off checking which guilds have<br/>
the most comparable level players on when your on, rather than which guilds<br/>
have the most members enrolled.<br/>
