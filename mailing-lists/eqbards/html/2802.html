<div id="ygrps-yiv-188307551"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Asking Ton Twostring (Freeport) about &quot;agents&quot; will get you a list of names<br/>
&gt; of agents who report to Felisity Starbright (Freeport). If you ask Felisity<br/>
&gt; about each of those agents by name, she&#39;ll tell you where they are. Here are<br/>
&gt; her answers:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dark Deathsinger - Innothule<br/>
&gt; Silna Songsmith - Rivervale<br/>
&gt; Travis Two-Tone - Nektulos<br/>
&gt; Drizda Tunesinger - The Ferrot<br/>

I did that this morning to no effect.  Of course, I haven&#39;t made up my<br/>
mind if the problem is this or the fact everytime I&#39;ve zoned from OOT<br/>
back to Freeport on the boat, my &#39;puter has crashed.<br/>

England&#39;s on the anvil--hear the hammers ring--<br/>
Clanging from the Severn to the Tyne!<br/>
Never was a blacksmith like our Norman King--<br/>
England&#39;s being hammered, hammered, hammered into line!</div>
