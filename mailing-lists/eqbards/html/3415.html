<div id="ygrps-yiv-678872545">since someone pointed out that you can put an axe in your throwing hand<br/>
_after_ you start playing hymn with a mandolin and play a mean solo on<br/>
your &quot;axe&quot;, i&#39;ll bring up an even funnier one. while playing the flute,<br/>
put a spear into your throwing slot - OUCH! you just jammed the spear<br/>
right through your head. a great way to impress young characters with how<br/>
tough you are. ;)<br/>

&quot;Only one man could kill this many russians. Find him, and bring his guitar to me.&quot;<br/>
