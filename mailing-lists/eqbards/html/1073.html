<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512130372"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I tried using the current version <br/>
&gt;of the amulet along with - this may sound funny - one of those &quot;gowns&quot; you <br/>
&gt;can buy in the Qeynos market. Well, it&#39;s either a gown or a blouse. I <br/>
&gt;forget, anyways it looks like a shirt, but it gives +5 Cha, and I don&#39;t know <br/>
&gt;if it&#39;s still available. It was pretty funny to be walking around with it on <br/>
&gt;and my buddies would make comments on it... (I kept having to defend myself, <br/>
&gt;&quot;I&#39;m not a transvestite bard, I SWEAR!!!&quot;). Anyways - they would shut up if <br/>
&gt;they wanted me to buy there equipment cheaper than they could ever hope for <br/>
&gt;from a merchant.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a Silk Evening Shirt (or tunic). And I&#39;d thank you to quit oggling me!<br/>
The ladies never minded the feel of silk on my skin, that&#39;s for sure!<br/>
