<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532886381"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Level 39: Invis to Undead (useful in Lower guk etc)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our current invis song works against the undead.  I&#39;ve walked unmolested<br/>
throughout all of Unrest (including a fully spawned basement and third floor)<br/>
enough times to verify this.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve like to see a healing equivalent of Desperate Dirge.  Uses 800 mana, and<br/>
does a massive group heal.</div>
