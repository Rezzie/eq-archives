<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064323232"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If so, then I apologize. I&#39;m just growing weary of<br/>
&gt; sarcasm as of late. Newbies asking questions on the<br/>
&gt; server that a simple yes or no question would answer<br/>
&gt; and all they&#39;re getting are long drawn out cut-downs<br/>
&gt; from &quot;holier than thou&quot; types. Drives me nuts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; hrm, holier than thou? yeesh...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nonono.. I wasn&#39;t calling you holier than thou, I was<br/>
speaking of the sarcastic people on the server that<br/>
insist upon giving newbies a hard time even for the<br/>
not-so-obvious questions.</div>
