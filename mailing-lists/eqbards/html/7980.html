<div id="ygrps-yiv-572578926">perosnally i think the Dev Team has done a VERY VERY poor job on the female<br/>
models. The clothing they get as newbies COULD be described as sexist and<br/>
male chauvenist crap. Why arent newbie men in lion cloths and singlets?<br/>
Also, for example, Wood Elf Ranger men look WAY better that Wood Elf Ranger<br/>
Women, they look much more like Rangers than their female counterparts.<br/>
It seems quite obvious the Dev Team is an all male affair.<br/>
