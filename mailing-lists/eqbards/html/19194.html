<div id="ygrps-yiv-442352336">Bards get 2HS and 2HB by default, but they&#39;re capped at 1.  This was<br/>
apparently a holdover from Beta, but couldn&#39;t remove it because all melee<br/>
classes (of which we are a subset) get 2H skills.<br/>
<br/>
You can use it, but you&#39;ll never be as proficient as your 1H.<br/>
