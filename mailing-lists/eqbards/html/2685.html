<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180668343">Theres actually a new quest(todays patch) thats bard only I think. There<br/>
are a few bard npc scouts around the world that ask you to carry<br/>
packagas. One is near the entrance to feerot from innothule, two are in<br/>
freeport bard guild, and the others I&#39;m not sure. I did the one from<br/>
feerot to freeport cause I noticed it as I was leaving to head to<br/>
freeport bank. :) Hell an extra plat for going to the bank is pretty<br/>
good. <br/>
