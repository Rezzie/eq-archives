&gt;All necros I&#39;ve ever grouped with want me to play hymn of restoration &gt;and<br/>
&gt;they claim it greatly helps their mana regen.  All other mana users &gt;see no<br/>
&gt;increase in mana regen no matter what song I play.  Maybe this is a &gt;bug <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;just affects Necros?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this is because necros have a health to mana song that they keep zapping <br/>
themselves to raise mana faster. with a bard constantly playing heal, their <br/>
downtime is very minimal.</div>
