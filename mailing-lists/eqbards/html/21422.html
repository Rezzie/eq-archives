<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685599154">funny you should say that, seems like with my necro the only groups that i<br/>
find are xp groups (unless its with guildies or raids)... however going deep<br/>
in dungeons i rarely... unless its afterwards to do a CR by summoning their<br/>
butts to the zone. Its another reason why i play my bard again... that and i<br/>
was sick of running for hours to go from point A to B in Kunark with jboots.<br/>
Bard does it in minutes and funny enough, even though i feel my role is<br/>
limited in the group as a bard, i feel more appreciated and have more fun<br/>
cause i can actually see my xp move unlike 51+ levels. its pretty sad when<br/>
people you know have made new words for xp...<br/>
<br/>
Previously people would say Ding! (meaning level)<br/>
but now there&#39;s :<br/>
Sling (Sliver of xp moved)<br/>
Bing (bubble of xp filled)<br/>
<br/>
sad i tell ya<br/>
