<div id="ygrps-yiv-619811787">I have found running past Evil Eyes not treacherous.  BUT, you need to con<br/>
them from extreme range and make sure they are NOT King Xorbb!  He is very<br/>
aggressive and terrible!  He saw my Bard when he was 17 or 18 and cast a very<br/>
nasty combination of spells that left me dead in seconds.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, I think Beholder is easier to traverse than HHP.<br/>

&gt; Is it possible to run through Beholder with Accelerando?  I made the trip<br/>
&gt; through last weekend crawling along high on the cliff and it was nerve<br/>
&gt; wracking.  I would much rather make a fast dash through and get it over<br/>
&gt; with!  But I saw at least a dozen evil eyes from my vantage point on the<br/>
&gt; cliff wall...can I run past fast enough to avoid trouble?<br/>
