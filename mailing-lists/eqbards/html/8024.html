<div id="ygrps-yiv-721919244">I think the bard and enchanter classes both not only appeal a little more<br/>
to women - but to the older player as well.  Both are surprisingly similar<br/>
if not in function - in role. Our best moments are when we are making<br/>
OTHERS better - support.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a female thing?  Probably - also something the older player also<br/>
enjoys more. I don&#39;t feel any particular need to be the center of<br/>
attention, nor the Avatar.<br/>
<br/>
I also found crafts a fantastic outlet for creativity and player<br/>
interraction - at least before they nerfed them so badly I was actually<br/>
penalized for trying to live that kind of life.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;and, to make this bard related... I think the bard class and the cleric <br/>
&gt;class appeal most to females because of their cooperative roles and their <br/>
&gt;ability to make others around them stronger... agree?  disagree? </span></blockquote></div>
