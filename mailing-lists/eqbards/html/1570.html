list is active! I began playing a wizard, and then switched to a bard to see<br/>
if it was any fun or not...I haven&#39;t played the wizard since&lt;G&gt;.<br/>

I also run a fanfiction site for EverQuest.  The site carries fanfiction<br/>
from all races and classes, but I&#39;d like to begin a bard section...we are,<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
