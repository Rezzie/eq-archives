There was another one that let you see how it worked in a group (ie like a<br/>
spreadsheet with your group members) but I cant find it - might have been an<br/>
Excel worksheet.<br/>

I have seen a few great tables and charts of experience needed to level, and<br/>
also articles on how experience is divided based upon level of player and<br/>
level of mob.<br/>
<br/>
I was looking for them today and I can&#39;t find them :(.<br/>
<br/>
Does someone have some URLs or some information saved somewhere?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
