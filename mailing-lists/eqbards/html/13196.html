Subject: Recent debate on level affecting melee.<br/>
<br/>
  Lately, I&#39;ve been debating with a handful of people whether<br/>
  level has anything to do with meleeing a NPC.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
  All the tests I&#39;ve run and experimented with were on lower level<br/>
  characters, but I&#39;m curious if the trend holds true to higher<br/>
  levels.<br/>
<br/>
  What do you all think?<br/>
