<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046552875"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;At some level your normal regeneration rate gets upgraded to 3<br/>
&gt;pts/tick (not quite sure when or if this is sitting), which<br/>
&gt;would put it at 19 pts/tick at L42. Sitting gives you an extra<br/>
&gt;1 pt/tick, for 20 pts/tick.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, sitting doubles your natural regen rate, as a troll regens 2 hp<br/>
standing, 4 sitting.  I was curious whether or not HP regeneration ever<br/>
increased, this is good to know.</div>
