<div id="ygrps-yiv-422099661">Gratz Darkfox! Glad to hear you made it. Saw you briefly in HS sunday night,<br/>
looked like you guys were doing CR. I was running our tp&#39;er over for us to<br/>
leave, so if you spoke and I didn&#39;t respond, it was because I wasn&#39;t at that<br/>
machine. <br/>
I agree with what Darkfox says about exp and grouping. HS is awesome for<br/>
exp, I just dinged to 57 myself there. You do have to take a group in with<br/>
you though, and of course everyone has to have a key. We hardly ever do<br/>
pickup groups. If guild and friends can&#39;t fill group, we log or play twinks.<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s due to being on Xegony. Lots of very opinionated people on<br/>
Xegony, to put it mildly. <br/>
<br/>
Brilinnia Ban&#39;sidhe, 57 until we go to Fear tomorrow!<br/>
Venator Sapentia, Xegony</div>
