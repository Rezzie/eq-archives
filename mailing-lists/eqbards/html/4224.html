<div id="ygrps-yiv-349387795">The funny thing about the acronym-itus that has struck in EverQuest (note I<br/>
did not use EQ?  hehe), is that one of our regular group members makes up<br/>
acronyms on the spot.  Very unnerving for the rest of us.  He&#39;ll spout one<br/>
of these off and the rest of us stand around, looking carefully at each<br/>
other, trying to discern if anyone else knows the meaning.  Then we all<br/>
look at him and say &quot;What??&quot;.  After countless times, he is still doing<br/>
this.  <br/>
