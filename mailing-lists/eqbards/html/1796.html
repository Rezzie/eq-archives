So now that we have your attention, do you have any idea why it&#39;s taken so<br/>
long to fix the bard animation so we aren&#39;t all the time speeding around<br/>
strumming a pipe when we&#39;re supposed to be beating a drum?  That&#39;s a<br/>
pervasive silliness in the game environment.  I&#39;m rather surprised playing<br/>
the pipe is correctly animated but the skill we probably use most of our<br/>
time isn&#39;t.<br/>
