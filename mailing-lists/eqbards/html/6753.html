<div id="ygrps-yiv-831945076">First off, in my twenties I can outdamage my cleric comrade in any melee<br/>
situation. Dual Wield does increas the amount of damage I can do<br/>
significantly. Once in their 20s Clerics are weak melee players, I just<br/>
wouldn&#39;t group with a burn and wack cleric, it&#39;s plain silly. In our group<br/>
(warrior, cleric, bard wizard) until recently it has been the warrior and I<br/>
tanking, the cleric medding and healing. Now it is the warrior tanking, me<br/>
singing AoE damage and getting wacked by mobs and healed by the cleric. The<br/>
warrior keeps the mobs off the cleric and the wizard and me if I get in<br/>
trouble. My cleric loves me for the down time I releive him of (with the<br/>
heal song) and I love him for keeping me alive *smiles*<br/>
