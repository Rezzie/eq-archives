<div id="ygrps-yiv-247997681">&quot;A paladin friend scoffs whenever he hears about others who can&#39;t taunt<br/>
mobs, and swears by flash of light as a spell that taunts better than<br/>
taunt.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Flash of Light is actually awesome to taunt. I usually play my young rogue<br/>
with a pallie friend and that&#39;s the only way he keeps the MOB on him. Better<br/>
than taunt, hands down.<br/>
