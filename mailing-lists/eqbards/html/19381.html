<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634786099">Ouch, I&#39;m really sorry you lost MM drums.  Now is the time to start pushing<br/>
for Nagafen raids though...  Selo&#39;s Drums of March are a pretty common drop.<br/>
In fact Nagafen dropped two sets for us last time.  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Try switching from weapons to drums while levitating out over lava in Sol B<br/>
and dropping a Ykesha into the bottom of a lava pool.  NOT FUN.  I did<br/>
manage to retrive it though.<br/>
