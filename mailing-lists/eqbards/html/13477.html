<div id="ygrps-yiv-883678827">I posted yesterday about a problem I had with Lament in Cazic.  Most people<br/>
agreed that the reason Lamented mobs still aggroed was due to a pathing bug.<br/>
That is what I assumed was causing the problem but I just wanted to make<br/>
sure.  Thanks everyone for the info.<br/>
<br/>
Another Lament question.<br/>
<br/>
I have noticed that either one of two things will happen when a mob resists<br/>
the Lament song.  Sometimes when you get the resist message the mob doesn&#39;t<br/>
aggro and remains where he is at.  You can then reattempt to Lament them.<br/>
Other times, the mob will aggro as soon as you get the resist message.  It<br/>
appears that a second resist check is made if the mobs resists the initial<br/>
Lament attempt.  If the mob fails the second resist check, he doesn&#39;t aggro.<br/>
If he makes the second resist check, he aggros on you.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else noticed this as well?<br/>
