<div id="ygrps-yiv-250947177">I have only been casually following this thread, so excuse me if i make a <br/>
broad assumption here.  It seems the people who are having trouble with <br/>
missed notes on certain songs (Denon&#39;s Discord, Charismatic Carillon) have <br/>
also stated that the their skills in the required instruments for these <br/>
songs (Brass, Wind) are lacking.  There is a direct relationship between <br/>
your skill in the instrument needed for a song and your ability to start the <br/>
song, even if you are singing it not using the instrument.<br/>
<br/>
When you first get Carillon you have awful wind skills, and the first wind <br/>
song you can play non-stop to build this skill is the Aquatic Aria (16th <br/>
lvl).  So till you get to 16th and practice up wind to near max Carillon <br/>
will have a lot of missed notes.  Same with Denon&#39;s, at 18th lvl your Brass <br/>
skill is near nil.  So trying to start DDD will be a major pain.  I noticed <br/>
my missed notes on DDD went down a lot when my brass skill got past 80 (took <br/>
a lot of practice time).  I know keep all my instrument skills maxxed or <br/>
near maxxed at every level and my missed notes are not that bad, but still a <br/>
pain none the less.<br/>
