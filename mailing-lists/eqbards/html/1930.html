&gt; The first thing I do when I get off the boat now is wait for<br/>
&gt; the &quot;[character name] saved&quot; message.  I&#39;ll run around, but I<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t risk *doing* anything.<br/>

was true for the one time that I tried it, so you might give that a shot.<br/>
It can be a simple greenie, supposedly.</div>
