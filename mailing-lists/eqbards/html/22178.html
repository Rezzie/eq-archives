Believe it or not, but there&#39;s *better* experience out there than Frontier<br/>
Mountains.  I&#39;ve been living it up in Dalnir for the past 4 levels and I<br/>
swear I&#39;ve never seen my exp bar fill so fast.  Second floor around the<br/>
pool/Imprecator area with a good puller will have you smiling from ear to<br/>
ear.</div>
