<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120952554">I actually haven&#39;t noticed this effect with my bard, though i could give<br/>
it a try tonight (assuming I&#39;m not an idiot, err umm... well...) since I<br/>
am less than a bub from 19 (and my first ever trip to the little<br/>
continent).  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; This is very easy for a bard to test.  Accelerando uses a<br/>
&gt; drum.  Before you level and when your skill is maxed (and if<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re under level 40), stop/start it a couple thousand<br/>
&gt; times.  Note your missed note rate.  After you level, repeat<br/>
&gt; but don&#39;t equip a drum (that will stop you from getting any<br/>
&gt; skill increases).  Compare.<br/>
