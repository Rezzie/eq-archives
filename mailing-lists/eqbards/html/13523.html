<div id="ygrps-yiv-554284897">i asked someone who tested the zone before going to the live servers.  he<br/>
said the belt, as awesome as it is, is a quest component as are all drops on<br/>
PoS.  wow.  also said a lot of stuff won&#39;t be able to be accessible<br/>
pre-expansion, but some is now obviously.<br/>

&gt;   This was a drop off a Happy Harpy. What it looks like is <br/>
&gt; either the quest<br/>
&gt; components are really really sweet or there are both drops <br/>
&gt; and questable<br/>
&gt; items there. SOunds fun!<br/>
