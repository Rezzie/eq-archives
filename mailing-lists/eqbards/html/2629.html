<div id="ygrps-yiv-772664440">I have personally tried that and found that as soon as you zone, you turn<br/>
blue again.<br/>
<br/>
When I mentioned that to a guildmate, the told me that when you go into<br/>
options & go un-anon, everyone else sees you as blue, though you look purple<br/>
to yourself (similar to the HIDE bug).<br/>
<br/>
So as far as I&#39;m aware, there&#39;s no way a guild can play as roleplayers by<br/>
color (well, a couple workarounds, but the workarounds suck)<br/>

&gt; Is your guild not aware that you can switch anonymous off?  I was not<br/>
&gt; pleased to find that invoking /roleplay also made me anonymous.  Verant<br/>
&gt; blindsided me with an unexpected side effect.  So when turning on<br/>
/roleplay<br/>
&gt; I simply try to remember to go to Options-General and turn anonymous back<br/>
off. </span></blockquote></div>
