by a friend of mine and as I&#39;ve tried some myself.  During combat, while<br/>
you&#39;re hitting and perhaps being hit, you have to keep an eye everyone&#39;s<br/>
health and if someone is getting too low, target, cast, then return to the<br/>
target you were hitting.  Make that worse by using your own damage spells<br/>
sometimes, balancing that against potentially vital healing.  And you get<br/>
to decide what&#39;s &quot;too low.&quot;<br/>

Makes playing a bard and twisting songs seem easy.<br/>
