<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002992183">Has the Mem Blur component been ┬ônerfed┬ö?  I tried Power leveling someone<br/>
the other night while camping Gate Potions in Cazic Thule.  Fought it down<br/>
to next to nothing ┬û charmed it ┬û and when Charm Broke ┬û the 20┬Æish Druid<br/>
killed it but didn┬Æt get the XP.  I thought that was ┬ôthe Program┬ö.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
