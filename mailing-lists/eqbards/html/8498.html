<div id="ygrps-yiv-707528618">Since you feel more confortable testing the numbers for yourself, here&#39;s how<br/>
I set about disproving the jig Vs mana regen debate.  Your comments are<br/>
welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Set up:<br/>
<br/>
L21 bard, L35 shaman.<br/>
<br/>
Control:<br/>
Shaman burns all mana down until he cannot cast sense magic (5 mana).<br/>
Shaman stands, repeatedly attempting to cast companion spirit (350 mana)<br/>
until he doesn&#39;t receive the Insuffient Mana message.  We can assume that at<br/>
the beginning of the timed interval the shaman had less that 5 mana and at<br/>
the end of the elasped time the shaman had greater than 350 mana.  The<br/>
potential error variance between assumed &quot;0&quot; mana and casting mana<br/>
is -1.43%.<br/>
<br/>
Test:<br/>
Shaman repeats the above, however the bard should commence playing jig prior<br/>
to the timed interval.<br/>
<br/>
Results:<br/>
Times were near equal (delta: &lt; 7 sec)  however difference in regen rates<br/>
amoung classes/races/int/wis do not allow us to to draw a universal mana<br/>
regen rate.</div>
