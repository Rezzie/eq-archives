<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024307671">PC problems last night caused me to loose my bookmarks.  I was able to find<br/>
most of my favorite EQ ones but two key URLs I couldn&#39;t find were John Kim&#39;s<br/>
page and Alacazam&#39;s (sp?  if I could spell it I could get there, right?).<br/>
If someone could post those I&#39;d be much obliged.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
