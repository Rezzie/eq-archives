<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146679151">I played a bit at lunch.  Now that we have a the<br/>
secondary resist message on Lullaby, it is<br/>
disturbingly easy to see just how incredibly<br/>
poorly lullaby works.  I was fighting groups of<br/>
faeries in lfay (that are barely blue to me) and<br/>
getting less than 50% success rate at lullabying<br/>
them.  This is with singing the song continuously<br/>
like GZ said we should.<br/>
