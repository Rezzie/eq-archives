&gt; &gt; Depends on where you currently are hanging out. I was mostly in Beholder<br/>
&gt; &gt; around that level with a group. Hunting minos for their axes and a horn <br/>
&gt;(for<br/>
&gt; &gt; later use).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just an aside, but if you are hanging for a minotaur horn, don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;bust a gut to hunt minotaurs to get one.  I bought mine from a<br/>
&gt;store in Freeport for around the 5g mark.  Much easier, and less<br/>
&gt;fun, too.  But if you have other things to do, I&#39;d recommend my<br/>
&gt;method.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah nope - not hanging for a minotaur horn. Actually like many people, was <br/>
hanging out in Beholder to get a minotaur axe or three - and well, minotaur <br/>
horns just kinda happen. Usually left there with a few at least. Just saying <br/>
it&#39;s an easy way to get a wind instrument while you are going for the xp and <br/>
the axes.<br/>
