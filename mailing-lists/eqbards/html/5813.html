<b>Subject:</b> {OT} Hotmail Compromised!   Warning to Hotmail users! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-546732883">Apologies in advance for the OT spam, however, we have over 300 readers,<br/>
and a good hefty percentage are Hotmail users.<br/>
<br/>
From Slashdot.org (http://slashdot.org):<br/>
&quot;Allright this has been submitted a lot so I&#39;m going to throw it up.<br/>
Hotmail has been cracked. Badly. Basically there is a web page with a form<br/>
(no I&#39;m not going to link it here, but I&#39;ve seen it) that allows you to<br/>
login as anyone and read/write/delete their email. Be afraid. And if you&#39;ve<br/>
got a message to yourself with like your VISA number in it, I&#39;d think twice<br/>
about it ;) &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This was independently confirmed by a friend of mine who is also a Network<br/>
admin.  I&#39;ve been to one of the &quot;sites&quot; and it appears that the hack has<br/>
been removed/blocked.<br/>
Currently, Hotmail is not responding, so my guess is that Microsoft finally<br/>
got wise and shut it down.  In any case, be aware, and I guess if you&#39;re on<br/>
Hotmail, you&#39;re probably not reading this anyway (or if you are, then it&#39;s<br/>
fixed.)<br/>
