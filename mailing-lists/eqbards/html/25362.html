<br/>
Well, you guys asked me to let you know what I got for the Horn in the <br/>
end.  To bring you up to date, I lucked into a Horn of Hsagra, doing a <br/>
low-level quest in Ak&#39;Anon (probably due to a loot-table mixup).  I<br/>
offered <br/>
it to a friend of mine who is in a guild, and he said to write my own <br/>
ticket.  So I did.  I requested the Lute of the Howler, and some coins<br/>
for <br/>
the Nostrolo Tambourine quest.  I didn&#39;t expect to get all of that, but<br/>
I <br/>
was hopeful.</div>
