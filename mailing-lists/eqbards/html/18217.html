<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637929860">Well, last night I ran a small test to see if the third number in the /loc<br/>
does indeed mean the z-axis problem is fixed.  I grouped with a guildmate<br/>
and had her go to the top of the ramp to the Paladin guild in FV.  I then<br/>
ran down the bank to the base of the tower so that I was directly underneath<br/>
her.  I then played HoR.  She felt no affects.  I then ran about 1/2 way up<br/>
the bank and had her walk down the ramp.  Still no affects.  It wasn&#39;t until<br/>
I came back up to her level that her wounds started healing.<br/>
