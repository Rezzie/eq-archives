<div id="ygrps-yiv-471943458">Exp depends _alot_ on the levels of the other people in the group.  I have<br/>
been in Bouncer groups for over 10 levels now.  At 35 with 45&#39;s and<br/>
49.999&#39;s, yes it sucks.  But when you are 45 or 49.9999 and there is no<br/>
where else to go....  Well, some exp is better than none at all.<br/>

p.s. Ak&#39;Anon is a dungeon right? (Although I tried killing the gnome guards<br/>
but had to quit.  They are just too cute to kill &lt;sigh&gt;)  Brownies on the<br/>
other hand... And Freeport is a city dungeon now.  The PoF Spectre cave was<br/>
empty - of spectres that is - at midnight Sunday night because there were 3<br/>
campers there.  Sad thing - I was one of them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Would it just<br/>
&gt; &gt; be better to join a group in one of the dungeons or kill ogre bouncers?<br/>

&gt; Ogre bouncers, imo, have not been good experience.<br/>
