<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012840492">My first planes trip since August? 1999!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
As many on our list know I had a high level Bard on Test and had been on a few planes runs there.  Well, last night hallmarked my first planes run _ever_ on a live server!  Hehe no big deal but it was to me.  I haven&#39;t done a planes run in months and it was really nice to do one again.  Especially since I deleted my bard on Test during the incredible Pwipe fiasco.<br/>
<br/>
I went to Hate with my guild last night (Isengard on Saryrn server) and within 1 hour I scored both the 6 note blade and Evensong off the Maestro of Rancor.  I had to log out shortly thereafter without seeing a single piece of Imbrued drop but hey, I was happy nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
Ciao!<br/>
