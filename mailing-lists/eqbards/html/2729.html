<div id="ygrps-yiv-370002645">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
In response to<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So we are all real good online Bards and have<br/>
excellent musical abilities to the point of powerful<br/>
magic, etc.  But what about in /ooc real life?<br/>
Anyone have any talent or interest?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve played music from a very early age started<br/>
banging on guitar at 4 or so and got my first bass at<br/>
13,  I started a  very successful Punk band for almost<br/>
10 yrs, toured Europe, Australia, Canada, and the USA<br/>
multiple times.  In addition to the touring we<br/>
recorded 5 cd&#39;s had one of our songs played on  30<br/>
commercial stations across the US and even had our<br/>
video get on MTV (yuck). Im not playing in the band<br/>
anymore but do still greatly enjoy music and my bard, <br/>
my new profession is in the game industry.  Well<br/>
there&#39;s my 2 copper&#39;s worth.<br/>
<br/>
best regards,<br/>
