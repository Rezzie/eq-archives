<div id="ygrps-yiv-748006046">I think you can do better in Dagnor&#39;s Cauldron if<br/>
you tried.<br/>
And I don&#39;t think all 10K dmg are bugs.<br/>
If you fall off the the highest cliff in East Karana<br/>
you take about that much damage. Yes, this is from<br/>
personally experience. <br/>
<br/>
Note to self: Don&#39;t reach for a drink when you&#39;re <br/>
running in that area again.<br/>
