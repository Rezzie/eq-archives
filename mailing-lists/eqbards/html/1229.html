<div id="ygrps-yiv-263753657">I killed Queen Nasheeji in Lesser Faydwer a while back myself, couldn&#39;t find<br/>
anyone who knew what to do with the Pulsating Brood Clutch though, and I was<br/>
hurting for cash..... so I sold it.<br/>
<br/>
I have also heard that Crookstinger carries a magic weapon of some sort, I<br/>
believe it&#39;s supposed to be useable by magic types.<br/>
