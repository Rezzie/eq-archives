<div id="ygrps-yiv-420031301">I sent Baelish of EQCaster&#39;s Realm a quick note yesterday about bard<br/>
resists.  He had just gotten clarification on resists for other casters from<br/>
GZ and so I asked him if GZ had said anything about bard resists.  He had<br/>
not so Baelish sent him another email about bards specifically and the<br/>
response is now up on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a><br/>
Interesting stuff, about what we suspected it appears.<br/>
