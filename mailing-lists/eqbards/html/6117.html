<div id="ygrps-yiv-798682075">Ah, only to my bard friends do I release this info,<br/>
but there&#39;s a troll out in the OOT that you can solo<br/>
around 24 or so.  May need to take one person, he&#39;ll<br/>
be on one of the rocks around the sirens.  He got me<br/>
over the mid-20&#39;s slump.  Unlike herman the hermit, I<br/>
never once got there and found him camped, and the<br/>
boat passes quite nearby to catch for a ride back to<br/>
FP.  Hope that helps you get to the upper 20&#39;s anyway.<br/>
