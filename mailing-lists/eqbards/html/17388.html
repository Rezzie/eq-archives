<div id="ygrps-yiv-443213536">All this talk about Stamina got me to thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Given the following facts:<br/>
<br/>
1.  AC is king.<br/>
2.  The &quot;Magic Number&quot; of stats is 75.  That is, below 75 in any<br/>
stat, <br/>
you get a substantial benefit by stat bonuses.<br/>
3.  I am wearing Carnal Pauldrons, AC 9 Dex +7<br/>
4.  I COULD be wearing Crested Spaulders, AC 11 STA +6<br/>
5.  My Dexterity is 114 now.<br/>
6.  My Stamina is the Half Elven base 70.<br/>
<br/>
I should in all likelihood ditch the Carnal Pauldrons and wear<br/>
Crested <br/>
Spaulders.<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t GZ state that the effect of Dex on missing notes in songs <br/>
capped at 100?  Unless I am going to miss SUBSTANTIALLY more notes <br/>
with 107 Dex than I do now at 114, I can see no reason not to switch.<br/>
<br/>
The extra 2 AC and hit point bonus from 70 to 76 Sta should easily <br/>
outweigh the Dex, unless I am mistaken.<br/>
