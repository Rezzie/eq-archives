<div id="ygrps-yiv-821383532"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You raise a level!  Welcome to level 50!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>(I have been trying for a long time to come up with better replies to<br/>
&quot;ding!&quot;s than &quot;congrats&quot;, &quot;congratz&quot;, or &quot;gratz&quot; with little success. &quot;Yay!&quot;<br/>
seems too vague, &quot;Bless you!&quot; to ingenuine, &quot;Go to Hell!&quot; too easy to be<br/>
taken the wrong way...and &quot;You smell great!&quot; is oddly often misunderstood. I<br/>
am stretching out, looking for alternatives, but for the moment I will stick<br/>
with the old standby.)<br/>
<br/>
Woooo! Congrats!<br/>
