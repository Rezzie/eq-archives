<b>Subject:</b> dragons easier? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016274120">I apologize, this is kinda off topic, but a question for some of the high<br/>
level bards.<br/>
Do dragons seem any easier to you guys?  We killed Vox last night with 30ish<br/>
people.  2 clerics, 1 bard, nobody died.  Last time we killed her we also<br/>
had no deaths.  Nags was almost as easy.<br/>
My guild is a great bunch of people, but I have trouble believing we&#39;re that<br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have an easier than normal time?  Possible dragon nerf?<br/>
