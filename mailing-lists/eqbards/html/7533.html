<br/>
Second one, zone when that many bettles are honed in<br/>
on you.  The tank is only going to be taunting one,<br/>
not 3 at a time.  Yes, it&#39;s embarassing to run for the<br/>
zone being chased by greenies, but it&#39;s more<br/>
comfortable than running back into said zone naked<br/>
looking for body.<br/>

Three, your a bard, trains love you, your in Grand<br/>
Central when it comes to trains *unrest*.  Just wait<br/>
till that festering hag catches a wiff of your life<br/>
force....<br/>
