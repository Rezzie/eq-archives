<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108971929">It has taken far too long, but I am slowly reaching the plateau of level<br/>
27.  Once I have it I will be the very happy singer of Solon&#39;s Song of the<br/>
Sirens.  So, this brings me to my question, where can I find a good place<br/>
for me to play charm the mob to gain experience by myself or in a very<br/>
small group?  I have adventured in many places, but would prefer to find a<br/>
place that is relatively safe for me.  Ie.  I don&#39;t have to die alot since<br/>
I have a knack for that and minimizing my chances of dying would be<br/>
greatly appreciated.<br/>
