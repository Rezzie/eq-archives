<div id="ygrps-yiv-360107239">I&#39;ve heard a few names of fellow musicians on our district mentioned here. I&#39;d<br/>
be thrilled to see us meet in game soon. If you&#39;re available to join Shulzari<br/>
for a few drinks and song (and maybe a hunt!)  in Freeport sometime this week,<br/>
or weekend, it would be an honor to purchase brew for you all, and share a tune<br/>
or two!<br/>
