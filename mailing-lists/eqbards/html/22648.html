<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242791574">If anyone has any tambourine coins at all, I&#39;d be more then likely to pay<br/>
more then what they usually go for, I really don&#39;t want MM drums and the<br/>
tambourine&#39;s a bit high for me to go get yet :).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll pay 1k for all the coins if you have them and are willing to be rid of<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
