&gt; What is the big deal with making EQ toys?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t understand why this bothers people...<br/>

would be between 6 inches and 8 feet.  (Was that on this list?)  Here we<br/>
were, all plotting which co-workers cubicles we&#39;d choose as spawn points for<br/>
giant (four foot we figured) spiders, debating whether to place Broon or a<br/>
Seafury Cyclopse in our front yards, wondering if willowisps would include<br/>
batteries, and if so, would they be dead...<br/>
