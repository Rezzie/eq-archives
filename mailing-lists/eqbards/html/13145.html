<div id="ygrps-yiv-677655940">I submitted updated screenshots of all the imbrued plate to EQLiz&#39;r, but<br/>
they have yet to post it. The only piece that didn&#39;t get an ac boost was<br/>
the bracer.<br/>

&gt; banshee pull yielded Imbrued Legs and I won the lotto!!! WOO HOO! I<br/>
&gt; immediately saw that the stats on the spoiler sites were incorrect<br/>
&gt; regarding<br/>
&gt; the AC.  Did anyone ever get a list of the AC upgrades to Imbrued?<br/>
&gt; Other<br/>
&gt; stats were the same so I&#39;m assuming they just gave the armor an AC<br/>
&gt; buff.  If<br/>
&gt; anyone could direct me to a website or list the AC changes I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; appreciate<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
