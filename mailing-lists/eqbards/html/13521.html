&gt;Quests items don&#39;t dissapear. A warrior had some quest items and logged he<br/>

server we got a trean tear (very nice druid earring) and a paladin belth<br/>
with haste, etc. These are all very nice items and stand apart of any<br/>
quests. Now, there are also a bunch of crappy pieces of armour that are<br/>
part of quests. The usual rythmn so far appears to be 1 no drop item and<br/>
then 2 fairly common tradable quest components. We actually had enough to<br/>
finish a cleric quest, Courage, last night. But of course the quest didnt<br/>
work and we got jack. No thank you, no not enough, just nothing from the<br/>
quest giver. Very disappoiting.</div>
