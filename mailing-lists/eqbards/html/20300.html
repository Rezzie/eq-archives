&gt; what are the stats on the new PC...err, specs that is, if you <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t mind my<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, after asking my friends who all were hardware guys before becoming<br/>
software programmers, I decided against Compaq for their use of cheap mother<br/>
boards, Gateway for mixing and matching motherboards (you might get a good<br/>
one, you might not) and settled on a Dell p3 700 with 256 meg and a geForce<br/>
64 meg video card. I now run with clipping on full in all Kunark zones<br/>
except Warslik&#39;s Woods. I also got a cable modem which helps.<br/>
I have to say that this is the first computer I ever bought which I hooked<br/>
up and it *just* worked..what a freakin relief. I had always built them from<br/>
parts before. <br/>
One note, pay the little bit extra for a MS mouse with IntelliEye, it uses a<br/>
light sensor instead of a trackball and is a HUGE improvement for very<br/>
little money.<br/>
