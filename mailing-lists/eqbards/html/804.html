<br/>
Thanks to all who answered my question about Kelin&#39;s Lament, I have just returned after a long but adventure-filled trip from Qeynos to Kelethin - the High Hold route was ok, though I got lost a few times - and have returned with my song.<br/>
<br/>
I used the poor man&#39;s &#39;gate&#39; spell to get back - put everything in the bank and jumped from one of those Kelethin platforms...<br/>
