<div id="ygrps-yiv-984148534">Maybe not the answer for everyone, but to dispell some<br/>
of the swamp gas theories, <br/>

I&#39;ve noticed that if I take a lag spike when singing,<br/>
it will lock the song in, and then I can&#39;t sing any<br/>
song until I get bashed, zone, or log off and back on.<br/>
 Great thing is, this happened on my healing pulse<br/>
while fighting the hermit in S karana.  Without be<br/>
able to weave he tore me up,  I couldn&#39;t even speed a<br/>

watching my inevitable death.  Did a /who gm all,<br/>
guess what, no one there.  Oh well, that&#39;s why we keep<br/>
a drum in the bank.</div>
