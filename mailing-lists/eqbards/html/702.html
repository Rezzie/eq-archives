<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944554022">I have a question for some of you higher level bards =).<br/>
<br/>
From viewing the lists of the songs, I understand that some are not<br/>
currently working, but in addition to these are there any other songs just<br/>
not worth buying? I know some songs are better for different situations etc<br/>
but I&#39;d hate to spend precious plat on a song Ill never sing or play =).<br/>
Opinions would be appreciated.<br/>
