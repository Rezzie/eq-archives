<div id="ygrps-yiv-2137508237"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You know reading John&#39;s post I realized its been a while since I died 4<br/>
&gt;times in an outdoor zone run in a while, but the last time it happened was<br/>
&gt;hilarious.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hardly ever die.  Im not being cocky, Im just a very cautious player.<br/>
When I solo, I cut and run if it looks iffy, and I try to only group with<br/>
people who have a clue about really grouping (i.e. one person pull, you all<br/>
wait here, no idiots going to sell when a pull is occurring, etc.).   But<br/>
last night, I felt like a horses ass..<br/>
<br/>
I had been playing in N. Ro.  Was in a group, foolishly one that did not<br/>
hold to my group ideals, but even more foolish was I for not disbanding.<br/>
Like I said, I dont die much.. on this occasion I did, and guess where I<br/>
re-popped....<br/>
<br/>
..<br/>
....<br/>
.....Quenos!  ARRRGH!  To say I felt like a dumb shit, was an<br/>
understatement, I had never got rebound in freeport, what was I thinking?<br/>
Luckily a LVL 40 Wizzie was in the zone, and after a little begging gladly<br/>
took me back to N. Ro.  At which point I got my corpse and got bound.</div>
