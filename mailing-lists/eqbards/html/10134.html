<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056037173">This would be an evil tactic if it works (not high enough to test it).<br/>
<br/>
Charm your opponent and make them attack the nearest Hill Giant (or other<br/>
big bad monster).  Or even have the caster attack greens and use up all his<br/>
mana.<br/>
<br/>
Or can you Levitate both you and your Charmed PC?  Cruise over some lava or<br/>
to a good sized drop, then let the charm wear off.  Ouch.<br/>
<br/>
Or quickly run into Lava, do a /pet guard here, then jump out of the lava.<br/>
<br/>
Charm is one of the most powerful PvP spells in the game.<br/>
