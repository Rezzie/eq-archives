&gt; resisting a disease/poison DOT because those spells check your magic resist<br/>

A lot of paladins complain about this one.  Some high level<br/>
disease and poison DoTs require cancel magic to dispel them.  <br/>
Cure poison/disease will not work on them, even though you&#39;d<br/>
think it would.  I would assume they do check your<br/>
disease/poison resist.<br/>
