special.  Remember, we can even wear plate (which I personally think is a<br/>
mistake.)<br/>

2) cf. JOAT (Jack of All Trades, Master of None.)  We can do a lot of<br/>
different things - but we will never be the masters at any one of them that<br/>
the class we&#39;re borrowing them from is.  Rogues will always be better<br/>
lockpickers, sneakers and trap disarmers. Monks will always fall better<br/>
than we can.  Rangers will always forage better.  And Warriors will always<br/>
fight better.  It is not in a single thing that we are great, but that in<br/>
all things we are good.<br/>
