<div id="ygrps-yiv-285770086">I feel your pain...  When I get very frustrated at players like that I often<br/>
say &quot;I don&#39;t tell you how to play you&#39;re your character, please don&#39;t tell<br/>
me how to play mine.  What I find so frustrating; with very few exceptions I<br/>
never see people telling any other classes how to play their character<br/>
except bards.<br/>

hehe, thats nothing, this morning in karnors we were at moat.  We had a<br/>
chanter, cleric, wizard, paladin and yes... 2 bards.   At least 4 times the<br/>
damn paladin kept telling us to just sing mana during fights.  Me and the<br/>
other bard were practically crying at the ignorance. Other bard was doing<br/>
lev 50 haste, nivs and clarity, and i was before he starting crying, doing<br/>
chant of battle, hymn of restoration and clarity... and yet kept hearing<br/>
play mana play mana.  Maybe if he let the full mana cleric/chanter stun<br/>
instead of him chain stunning we wouldnt of had that issue now would we.<br/>
