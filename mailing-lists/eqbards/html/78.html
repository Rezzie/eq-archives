<div id="ygrps-yiv-319689432">Greetings, fellow Bards! Allow me to introduce myself: I am Plastos,<br/>
Journeyman Bard (5th) from the great city of Qeynos in the realm (?) of<br/>
Fennin Ro. I have only recently arrived and barely explored the great world<br/>
of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to future discourse and revelry.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m not adventuring, I spend time in Qeynos learning to brew! Look me<br/>
up if you&#39;re in town and, if I&#39;ve been successful, we can share a pint!<br/>
<br/>
Plastos</div>
