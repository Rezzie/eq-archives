<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056138746">OK been hunting kael weekly for quite some time...<br/>
<br/>
Plate seems to be a rare drop.  We hunt Arena area and King Torm area.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions for specific areas or mobs that drop more plate?  I have <br/>
heard tell of a &quot;plate rotation&quot; but I don&#39;t know what it is or what the <br/>
mobs are in the rotation.  But it does get called as a camp on our server <br/>
and I&#39;ve yet to hear any info on it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks ahead of time,<br/>
<br/>
