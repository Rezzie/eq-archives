<div id="ygrps-yiv-413992409">Just peeled this off of Caster&#39;s Realm:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are still items that are restricted to the melee classes (and yes I&#39;m including the bard in this description, though they&#39;re really in a class all their own). &quot;<br/>

Heh!<br/>
Glad to at least see that *someone* recognizes the uniqueness of bards  ;o)<br/>
