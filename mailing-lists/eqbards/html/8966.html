<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613712723">In the server Fenin Ro, Genni is no where to be found. Some player said<br/>
that its bugged and GM already removed the spawn. I&#39;m surprised that a few<br/>
of you out there are talking about Genni. Which server are you on? How come<br/>
the same genni would work in one server but not the other?<br/>
Without fire opal stone, there&#39;re a few quests that I wanna do but can&#39;t<br/>
finish.<br/>
