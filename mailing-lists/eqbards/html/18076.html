me my order went through and was shipped on the 18th and gave me a UPS<br/>
tracking number. UPS tells me it&#39;s 5 days &quot;ground&quot; and should be here<br/>
Tuesday at the latest :) I can be patient. Besides, I figure some nice<br/>
camps will be open all day monday. I always wanted Jboots to save a song<br/>
slot :)</div>
