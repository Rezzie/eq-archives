<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821196">A few questions/comments:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;At level 33, 2AC item translates to 3 EAC<br/>
&gt;At level 34, 2AC item translates to 4 EAC<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like more information here please.  Specifically<br/>
what were your defense levels at the time.  How did<br/>
you isolate that 2 AC item, were you naked other than<br/>
it?  As I stated elsewhere using bronze armor only<br/>
(i.e. no stat boosts) and the same stats among<br/>
varrying naked warriors of various levels I got the<br/>
same effective ac from the same static set of armor<br/>
regardless of level, skills, etc.<br/>
