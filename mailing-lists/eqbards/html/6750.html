<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607020203">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
This is my first posting to the list and I was hoping by coming out of lurk<br/>
mode I might get some help from some of the elder bards here. I recently<br/>
attained my 15th level and ran to the bards guild in Kelethin to get<br/>
Kellin&#39;s Lucid Lullabye.  I went to www.harpers.net and took a look at the<br/>
writeup for this song. I am not sure of the proper usage for this song. How<br/>
should I use it say if I were approaching a dervish camp (like the one in<br/>
Oasis) with my group as opposed to using it in Unrest?  I did approach a few<br/>
bards who were over level 17 asking how exactly they used the song and I was<br/>
told on 2 occasions that they had gotten into more trouble than it was worth<br/>
with this song and not to use it.  After lurking on this list for the last<br/>
couple of weeks it seems that there are plenty of you out there who know how<br/>
to make this song work to your advantage and I&#39;d like to know how I should<br/>
approach this song.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for any help you can give me. I am very very happy<br/>
playing my bard and can&#39;t see myself playing any other character. But then<br/>
again, maybe I&#39;m just a wood elf in human&#39;s clothing =)<br/>
