Bards use mana for two songs: Denon&#39;s Desperate Dirge (an area effect <br/>
instant-damage) and Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens (a charm song).   Denon&#39;s <br/>
tends to use all of your mana in one shot - mana-improving items don&#39;t <br/>
appear to matter there.  SSS slowly eats your mana while charming <br/>
creatures.   One thing of note:  Bards are completely unaffected by any <br/>
sort of mana-refreshing or buffing song or spell. In other words, Breeze, <br/>
Clarity, etc. have no effect on Bards.  It&#39;s a small sacrifice for having <br/>
99 percent of our songs mana-free.<br/>
