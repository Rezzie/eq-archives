<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085701338">In response to your question the charred breastplate has a deep dull<br/>
charcoal look to it. I have it, the boots, and the gloves. ( last nite I<br/>
turned down rubicite gloves in fact to keep my charred. The 4 points better<br/>
of ac did NOT in my opinion offset the dex boost i got from charred!)<br/>
