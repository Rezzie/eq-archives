&gt;   Then it hit me.  &quot;Please bring it here...I CAN use<br/>
&gt; it&quot;.  I went to Rivervale, sprinted up the stairs, and<br/>
&gt; handed my Dirk to the Marshall.  He give me 3 gold,<br/>
&gt; some pittance of exp and a nice SHINY NEW Leatherfoot<br/>
&gt; Raider cap.  At AC4, its less than the AC of my Banded<br/>
&gt; helm (I HATE the Wood Elf Bronze one), but that +10<br/>
&gt; CHARISMA is NIIIIIICE.  By the time I got downstairs,<br/>
&gt; he was waiting with a new Dirk for me. </span></blockquote></div>
