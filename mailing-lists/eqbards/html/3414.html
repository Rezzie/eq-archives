&gt;&gt; &gt;Some merchants are just stingier than others and do not seem<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;to give you the best prices despite your faction.  Others will<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;give you the best prices even if they are indifferent to you<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;(if you have sufficient charisma).<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; That&#39;s part of the weird part, Twippie definitely usually gives me the best<br/>
&gt;&gt; price, but occasionally he gives me bad prices, then next time I zone in the<br/>
&gt;&gt; prices are back to best again, all with no faction change.<br/>

&gt;Yes, there seems to be a random component too.  Sometimes the<br/>
&gt;merchant by the Kelethin bank gives me the best prices if I<br/>
&gt;use the Charisma song, other times I have to trek over to the<br/>
&gt;Ranger&#39;s guild.<br/>

always gives me the best prices (and my Gnome Enchanter, too).<br/>
