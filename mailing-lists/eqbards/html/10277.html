<div id="ygrps-yiv-409858188">Have any of our knowledgeable members ever run across Diamond Dust in their<br/>
travels?  The gnome tinkerer in my guild has been bugging me incessantly to<br/>
ask everyone I know about it for days.  Any info appreciated feel free to<br/>
reply direct if you prefer.<br/>
