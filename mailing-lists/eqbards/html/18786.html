bards have. If something resists mez, then it comes straight for the<br/>
enchanter. (And if several things resist. Yikes! Dead enchanter.)<br/>
<br/>
This really isn&#39;t a bard-only problem. And Verant has chosen to<br/>
deal with it in ways other than just giving folk more AC to deal<br/>
with it.</div>
