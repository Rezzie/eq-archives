<div id="ygrps-yiv-702326378"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I should think so, on my server (Veeshan) I often see people trading Yk&#39;s<br/>
&gt; etc for Mithril and vice versa. I think the Greaves and Vambraces are the<br/>
&gt; most attractive pieces of armor out of the lot.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Here&#39;s the break down for everyone who doesnt know Mithril from<br/>
  Mac n&#39;Cheese.<br/>
<br/>
  Mithril Arms, Mithril Legs.  You&#39;ve got to take at least, and I<br/>
  mean least, 3 full groups of L45+ to get.<br/>
<br/>
  Ykesha.  Christ, my necro friend can friggin solo the G&#39;damn<br/>
  Lord room.  Gimme a break.  it takes 1, thats right, 1 full <br/>
  L45+ group (with enchanter) to get a Ykesha.<br/>
<br/>
  Mithril is much more rare than a Ykesha, it always has been, <br/>
  and until Tranix is camped, will always be.<br/>
<br/>
  I believe a Ykesha and maybe some cash in Kpp range would balance<br/>
  out for a Mithril Piece as listed above.  But as far as the BP and<br/>
  bracers go, they are so common and becoming just as worthless as that<br/>
  stupid unicorn shield and paldrons =)<br/>
<br/>
  Harm.</div>
