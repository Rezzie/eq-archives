&gt; Um no offense John but studies can be doctored to look like anything someone<br/>
&gt; wants to prove.  They start with a simple question:  &quot;Are you happy since<br/>
&gt; you won the lottery?&quot;    If they say no, continue on with the study.  If<br/>
&gt; they say yes, &quot;Thanks for your time.  Congratulations on your new found<br/>
&gt; money!&quot;  <br/>

articles if you&#39;re still skeptical, and read for yourself<br/>
exactly how these studies were done.  This is not one study by<br/>
a crackpot, it&#39;s generally accepted truth in psychology/<br/>
sociology.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what else I can do to prove the point.  Maybe I<br/>
should lie and say I&#39;m wrong just to get this off the list...<br/>
