<div id="ygrps-yiv-102050516">I love working for a &quot;bleeding edge&quot; company.  We don&#39;t have the authority<br/>
to update our own Virus Scanner software, and our &quot;state of the art&quot; support<br/>
staff is keeping things updated quit nicely as you all just found out.<br/>
Again I do apologize.<br/>
