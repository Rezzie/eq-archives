<div id="ygrps-yiv-882869774">Hehe.  I guess I was being intellectually lazy.  The thing is, there are so few places where see invis is<br/>
useful, and those are so obvious to all the other casters, that they reflexively toss see invis on<br/>
everyone else before I can bother to remem this song.  I&#39;ve had less practical use for this song than I<br/>
have for Melanie&#39;s Melifluous Motion.  I&#39;ll concede that saying it was &quot;pointless&quot; was an overstatement.<br/>
But still, it is by no means a strong addition to our song arsenal, particularly once see invis was added<br/>
to invisibility.  Easily bottom 10.<br/>

&gt; invis with a pet caster around see how much they enjoy recasting their pet<br/>

&gt; the invis mob you are fighting. </span></blockquote></div>
