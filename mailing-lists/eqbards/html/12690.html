<div id="ygrps-yiv-230953371">i am so bored at work i am surfing the ebay auctions.  i think the<br/>
salesmanship is hilarious, how almost all items are touted as the best and<br/>
their effects completely exaggerated.  two that just made me laugh was that<br/>
mistmoore battle drums increase songs by 30% (more like 16% by Maravana&#39;s<br/>
numbers, and widely believed to be no more than 20%) and the haste sash<br/>
increasing attack speed by 30% (more like 15%, the best warrior sword in the<br/>
game off Innoruuk is 30%).  anyway, just a comment.<br/>
