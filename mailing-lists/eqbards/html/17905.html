<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353461125">Also since this came up on the cleric list lately too:<br/>
<br/>
Heres just a few things I (lvl 20 and retired to Erud&#39;s Crossing)<br/>
learned from this list.<br/>
<br/>
How to weave.  Essential for a bard.<br/>
The cool all instrument attack (starting at 18).<br/>
What jewelry to buy for myself (Jagged bands, Oppaline Earrings)<br/>
About those +15 CHA beer mugs that people let rot in Ferrot.<br/>
An unbelievable amount of game mechanics (92.34189% from John Kim)<br/>
How to charm/solo with the bard song.  (Though I never did this, but I<br/>
told my friend about it, since he couldn&#39;t ever to get it to work)<br/>
