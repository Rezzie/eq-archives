 </span></blockquote>You can benefit from elites/commanders up to level 17.  But,<br/>
the experience is very little - although you can actually <br/>
solo them (good dual wield practice).<br/>
<br/>
The trains in there are pretty bad, but it has to be some<br/>
train to kill a level 30.  I admit at level 25 or so, I<br/>
was killed in BB by 3 elites and 1 commander simulatenously.<br/>
(I dropped one commander and 2 elites, the third elite <br/>
killed me) - but I saved the poor chap under attack.<br/>
<br/>
At level 30, you can roll in there and bust up the place.<br/>
