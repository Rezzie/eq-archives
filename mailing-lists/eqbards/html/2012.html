<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682014762">Sigh. After the last late night patch, I discovered the recently<br/>
discussed stacking of magic resist songs no longer works. What&#39;s up with<br/>
that? Was this too powerful a benefit? Meanwhile, the accellerando still<br/>
cancels sow when it wears off, as does levitate and of course the L30<br/>
song still doesnt work. Wish they would take a break from nerfing and<br/>
fix some bugs.<br/>
<br/>
I also discovered with great joy that our music skills are capped at 200<br/>
along with our combat skills. Guess I can&#39;t complain about that too much<br/>
as even a warrior&#39;s combat skills cap at 200, and you&#39;d think the<br/>
warrior would be better at them than other fighters. But if that&#39;s the<br/>
case, why are the magic users still shooting up over 200 in their<br/>
casting skills?<br/>
<br/>
A very depressed L41 bard. :(<br/>
