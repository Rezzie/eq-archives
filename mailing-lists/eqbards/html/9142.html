&lt;&lt; A level 31 friend reported getting experience grouped with a<br/>
 45, but not a 46.  My guess is it caps out at a 16 level<br/>
 delta. That is, a level 35 player grouped with a level 50<br/>
 would get exp, but a level 34 would not.  At the low end, a<br/>
 level 1 player will not get experience with a level 5 (4 level<br/>
 delta).  Everything else in the middle is a gradual scale<br/>
 between these two deltas. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I dunno bout this, when I was 30 I grouped with a 47 ranger and I got exp....</div>
