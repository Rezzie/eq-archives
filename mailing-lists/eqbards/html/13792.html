<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842808183">Capping at 1500 isnt really possible since that would require<br/>
180,000 customers/1500 per server = 120 servers<br/>
<br/>
I guess they could cap a server at a certain point which would give them<br/>
an average of 1500 at peak times (figuring that there are about 2100<br/>
people ave at peak time now that would mean 40% more servers than<br/>
currently are in use) <br/>
