<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868802994">The basic rule of thumb is: if it doesn&#39;t do damage, it doesn&#39;t break mez.<br/>
We usually take the opportunity to debuff mobs while they are still mezzed<br/>
before we attack them (which also gives the tanks a few seconds to Taunt it,<br/>
so it doesn&#39;t beeline for the enchanter when we break the mez).<br/>
