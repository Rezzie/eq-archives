<div id="ygrps-yiv-99103200">Has anyone tried to check out the EQ boards today?  I haven&#39;t seen them this lagged out since the game first went commercial.  Looks like that &quot;black helicopter&quot; theory of folks going after VI (hack-wise) may indeed be coming true.  Scary thought, but I guess they had to learn the hard way (if this is really what&#39;s happening) that you can only push folks around so long until they push back.<br/>
