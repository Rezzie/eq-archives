<div id="ygrps-yiv-75828532">I think they need to redo the spawn rate on this dirk.  it is too frequent.<br/>
Last night I went and tried to get a dirk.  I was expecting to sit around<br/>
for hours but as I get there, there were 6 campers of lvl 20+.  I asked them<br/>
if I can get a dirk and they said sure.  So I got one for free in 15 minutes<br/>
of getting to CB.  Then one of the guy left so I join their team to get<br/>
another one for my other rogue char.  To keep the story short, Divinni spawn<br/>
every 15 minutes, and each time he has the dirk.  We were giving the dirk<br/>
away to our friends, relatives, and just unknown plp.  I just think that a<br/>
weapon of that power should be more rare or harder to get.  This dirk is<br/>
better than a well balance ls!!!!!  So now I have 2 dirk.  1 for me lvl 17<br/>
bard and 1 for my lvl 17 rogue.<br/>
<br/>
This is just my 2 coppers.<br/>
