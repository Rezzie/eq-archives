<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145686650">I have been eagerly looking over the lists of test server spells on Caster&#39;s<br/>
Realm and have noticed one disturbing fact.  There are no new bard spells<br/>
listed, not even for our currently missing levels.  Every other class has at<br/>
least 15 spells.  With the expansion now less than a month away shouldn&#39;t<br/>
there be some new bard spells if they have any intention of getting them in<br/>
for the expansion release?<br/>
