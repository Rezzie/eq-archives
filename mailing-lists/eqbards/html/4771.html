<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564907404"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I&#39;ve tried this too for the reasons you cite.  The problem I<br/>
&gt; have with it is that there&#39;s no command to automatically face<br/>
&gt; the mob you are fighting, and in multi-mob situations it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; easy to get turned or have the mob move enough so that &quot;you<br/>
&gt; cannot see your target&quot; anymore.  You&#39;d think that if I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; fighting something, I&#39;d automatically want to keep facing<br/>
&gt; it...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to have that problem as well, I guess I just got so used to the view<br/>
that I can pretty much turn to face my next opponent while still in it. If<br/>
I&#39;m having a problem a quick two taps of F9, a little adjustment and then F9<br/>
three more times is all I need to do..</div>
