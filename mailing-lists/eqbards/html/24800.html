<div id="ygrps-yiv-957554843">It sounds like something was blocking mez, as in a &quot;stronger&quot; spell was in<br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
Example:<br/>
Sing Hymm after singing Cantana (55).  You just get no message.<br/>
<br/>
What message do you get when you try to mez a lvl 56+ mob?  I have never<br/>
tried.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds pretty weird to me, but if a mob is DOTed you will get a sucessful<br/>
mez message followed immediatly with the break message.  SO its no that.<br/>
