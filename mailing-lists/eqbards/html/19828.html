<div id="ygrps-yiv-758505536">I have gotten a few coins recently as gifts, but I don&#39;t know their sources<br/>
(ther than one was foraged int eh Emerald Jungle). I have:<br/>
<br/>
Toris Ton<br/>
Veksar Gron<br/>
Ik Gron<br/>
<br/>
the zones are:<br/>
<br/>
1 Lake of Ill Omen<br/>
2 Emerald Jungle<br/>
3 City of Mist<br/>
4 Kaesora<br/>
5 Dalnir<br/>
