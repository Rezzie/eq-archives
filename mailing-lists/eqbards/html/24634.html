<div id="ygrps-yiv-340158810">Been grouping in Skyshrine with some higher level friends -- the dropped armor there totally rocks -- and a full set of it will take your resists right off the charts.<br/>
<br/>
I know a 52 druid there soloing to twink his 23 warrior.  Are any bards doing this?  If so, what level and what songs are you using?<br/>
