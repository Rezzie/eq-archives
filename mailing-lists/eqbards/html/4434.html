<b>Subject:</b> Brahms Horn <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-851946590">Recently, a couple of guild members killed a mino named Brahms.  He dropped <br/>
a horn called &quot;Brahms Horn&quot;.  It is bard only.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve looked around a bit on the web to see if I could get any information on <br/>
this horn, but have not seen any.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know anything about this horn? Any information would be <br/>
appreciated.  Please feel free to Email me if you don&#39;t want to post.<br/>
