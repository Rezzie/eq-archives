<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908114769">Only 26 here, but one thing I have noticed is that<br/>
bards genrally are more mature players and better<br/>
role-players than most other classes.  Granted this is<br/>
a genralization, but we are not the power gamer type<br/>
character, we are the group type, the glue type.  I<br/>
like that.  One reason I don&#39;t want other races to<br/>
have bards is because I also like being rare.  In my<br/>
guild of 40, I&#39;m one of two.  I like that :)</div>
