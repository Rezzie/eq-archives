<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755430539">Made a level as my cleric last night.  Now lvl 14 casting lvl 4 &quot;Light<br/>
Healing&quot; spell.  Alteration (obviously) maxed for lvl 13.  112 Wis.<br/>
<br/>
Cast, fizz, fizz, cast, cast, cast, fizz, fizz, cast, fizz.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically that was my last fight of the evening since Veeshan (or at<br/>
least Lava Storm) crashed around 11:30 pm EST. <br/>
<br/>
Of course since as soon as the fight started, we were experiencing that<br/>
pre-crash packet loss, my connection probably was very bad. So this fits<br/>
into both theories...<br/>
<br/>
Our wizard is going to chart her fizzes when she levels (next Thurday). <br/>
She (like me) has a very strong connection normally.  <br/>
