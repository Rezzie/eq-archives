<div id="ygrps-yiv-977028467">GENNI RETURNS!<br/>
From what I hear Genni has returned to most servers in the Temple of Solusek<br/>
Ro. This means you can now purchase Fire Opals again. The trick is she loves<br/>
gold. You have to pay her 550 Gold Pieces, not 55 pp. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone know if this is true before I head that way with nothing but plat in<br/>
me pockets?<br/>
