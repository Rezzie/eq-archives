On Wednesday August 11, 1999 there was a strange happening on the Fennin Ro<br/>
server. As it seems, there was a level 68 Wood Elf Bard. This may and<br/>
probably was a bug but it is interesting to note nonetheless.<br/>

Thanks! (Note: The character was most likely controlled by an employee of<br/>
Verant, although this remains unconfirmed.)</div>
