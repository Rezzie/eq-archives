<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1074696790">Here is a wild idea for the melee types in the next Naf raid you may go on.  <br/>
Have them buy potions of Stalwart Regeneration, this potion give a small <br/>
regen effect and roots the drinker.  This way they will not get feared into <br/>
the lava as they will be rooted (this assumes the fighters are bright enough <br/>
to drink the potion AFTER getting in melee range of Lord Naf).<br/>
