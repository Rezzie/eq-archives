<div id="ygrps-yiv-658717605">Here&#39;s a little trick I learned in cazic this week for<br/>
getting mobs that you recently had charmed off of you,<br/>
stop attacking and hi them with a pixie strike and<br/>
time it so you step back just as it hits.  Kept them<br/>
from frenzing on me (as they tend to to coming out of<br/>
charm).  Once they&#39;re off you resume combat as normal.<br/>
