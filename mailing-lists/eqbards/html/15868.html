<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120331351">Rokenn&#39;s song analysis says these songs will partially stack but not the<br/>
speed component. Does the lower speed of Anthem override Warsong on the<br/>
bard or does the bard still get the 20% boost?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I happened to notice that the table for lullaby doesn&#39;t mention<br/>
the difference in healing between sitting and standing. Isn&#39;t it more<br/>
than just +2 hp for sitting?<br/>
