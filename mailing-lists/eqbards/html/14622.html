<div id="ygrps-yiv-874919282">In my intial post (maybe the second one, it was this AM) I spent a whole<br/>
paragraph saying how this wasn&#39;t a bash on lvl 50 players, and how I&#39;d<br/>
be one if I hadn&#39;t stopped playing for like 5 months...  Thats not where<br/>
I&#39;m getting at all.  My annoyance comes from every time Verant feels<br/>
compelled to keep the dragons challenging for the current crop of lvl<br/>
50&#39;s.  They are not considering the people who aren&#39;t there yet...<br/>
