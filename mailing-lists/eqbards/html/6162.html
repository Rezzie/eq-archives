&gt; Bards are ALWAYS useful.  From day 1, we have group-affecting always-on<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I also agree with Talies on this one.  In the numerous group that I have<br/>
been in, the members have always commented on how awesome we do in battle.<br/>
With you healing songs, and combat buffs and debuffs you not only reduce<br/>
the downtime but you can increase the rate of your combat.  Of course I do<br/>
remeber these groups getting overwhelmed once I left, but I won&#39;t say it<br/>
was me =).  Many people tend to be ignorant of the usefulness of a bard<br/>
whether it be by choice, don&#39;t let them discourage you at all.  We are and<br/>
will always be the single best addition to a group.  Since when can three<br/>
casters, a bard, a monk and a ranger hold a room?  I have done it easily<br/>
in the Hand room in Unrest and suffice to say the casters and the tanks<br/>
were impressed =).<br/>

BTW : two bards make for an awesome combination in a group =).  It great<br/>
to have 6 songs going at once =).</div>
