<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435739395">One thing I forgot to mention.  Since it takes less time to<br/>
stop and restart a song than waiting for it to pulse, you<br/>
could in theory heal your group faster if you were to stop and<br/>
restart Restoration every time it pulsed, instead of just<br/>
letting it play and waiting for the next pulse.<br/>
