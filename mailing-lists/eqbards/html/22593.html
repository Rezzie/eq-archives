<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262634875">my wife was the same way when she also played shada and now with her cleric.<br/>
i know it is hard to change old habits, i used to be stuck on the mouse too,<br/>
but one of the best things you can do for yourself is do whatever you have<br/>
to in order to break that habit and get using hotkeys.  they really make<br/>
playing 1000% better, for all classes and especially for bards.  and the new<br/>
10-slot hotkey banks are just icing on the cake.<br/>

&gt; got the hang of <br/>
&gt; using hotkeys for songs.  I&#39;m pretty much stuck on the old mouse for <br/>
&gt; twistings, which makes it a little harder to switch songs/instruments. </span></blockquote></div>
