<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-14665598">OK, been /auctioning my little Bardic lungs out in every zone from<br/>
E Karana to Freeport (my current mail runs).  Nobody seems to have any<br/>
Golden Amber Earrings to sell.<br/>
<br/>
Being a wimpy Wood Elf trying to wear heavy Bronze, I&#39;m on a quest for<br/>
items to increase my STR.  I&#39;ve got a purity belt and a spiked collar.<br/>
I thought the Golden Amber Earrings would be easy enough to find, but<br/>
not so far...<br/>
<br/>
One problem is I don&#39;t know where these come from.  Are they loot?  Are<br/>
they jewelcraft?  My normal modus operandi is to wander over to wherever<br/>
the loot comes from and /auction there...<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any better suggestions for +str items?  And if so, where do<br/>
they come from and what do they usually sell for?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
