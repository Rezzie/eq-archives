&gt;&gt; 2. Is it true that whoever wins the duel can loot items off of your body?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;No.  It used to be the winner was allowed one item.  But now you may not<br/>
&gt;loot the body at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On a sidenote, did anyone take the client poll on looting styles for the new<br/>
racewar server?  I was in the chat area when Fippy announced the results.<br/>
He said there was overwhelming, 3 to 1, support for Ralos Zek style looting.<br/>
That is, the victor can loot 1 item the opponent was wielding or wearing.<br/>
So perhaps this will be changed soon for normal duels as well.<br/>
