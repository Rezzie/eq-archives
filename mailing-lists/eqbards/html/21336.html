<div id="ygrps-yiv-727978506">Well folks it&#39;s been a long and fun (for the most part) ride in the Bardic realm. But after fighting the nerfs, changes, outright lies of Verant for 132 levels as a bard I&#39;m done.<br/>
<br/>
As of today my bard is in retired status except for Guild Raids where my friends need a song or three. I have given up and given in. I&#39;ve joined enchanterquest and started an enchanter all my very own.<br/>
<br/>
I wish those who continue the fight well. I won&#39;t be deleting Lyrnia nor will I quit EQ. I still hope for a future where my bardic abilities can truely shine in the Post-50 world and where I might actually be able to mez a moss snake. Until then I wish you all the best.<br/>
