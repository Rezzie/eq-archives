<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845155913">Well I&#39;m a Human Bard, follower of Bristlebane.<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure the gypsies are indifferent to me. (Could be wrong<br/>
because I stay invis when buying from them. Dumb SGs.)<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how much they offer for the combine. I sold mine (when I<br/>
got a barbed whip) to the bard&#39;s guild shop in freeport. And they&#39;re<br/>
amiable, and I did get 47.5pp for it.<br/>
The shady swashbuckler is indifferent to me, but I don&#39;t remember how<br/>
much the WB longsword costs. I&#39;m in Qeynos area now so it might be a<br/>
while til I can get back on this. Maybe if another Human bard out there<br/>
with 90+ charisma knows the price on the well balanced longsword?</div>
