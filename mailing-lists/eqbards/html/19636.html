<div id="ygrps-yiv-190432607">Hehe if you wanna know RNG pain how&#39;s this for an example.  My guild<br/>
decided to do a little hunting in City of Mists.  So we headed there and<br/>
setup camp for about 8 hours straight.  In this time period we had broken<br/>
a corner of a dungeon really nicely and were basically pulling non-stop.<br/>
As we all know the rare drops are random on all of the creature types in<br/>
the zone.  So for the whole time I was there we got a grand total of 0<br/>
drops common or uncommmon.  However to make things more interesting a<br/>
group was camped by the entrance for about 1 hour and got about 5 drops in<br/>
that time period..... talk about random =(.  And they got that bard dagger<br/>
which was even more annoying.<br/>
