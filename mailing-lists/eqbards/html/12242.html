&lt;&lt; I just hit lvl 11 and got my brass skill.  Am I wrong when I look at the<br/>
 song list, or is the first song I can use this for at lvl 18?  Is there<br/>
 anyway to practice it? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nope your right. And nope there isnt. When I saw this I didnt train my brass <br/>
skill until I got my 18th song. This gave me a lil boost in the skill as I <br/>
started at 90 instead of 55 skill.  A few less missed notes in the long run :)<br/>
