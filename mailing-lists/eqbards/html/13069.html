<div id="ygrps-yiv-921080256">If too many people attack you will have everyone go Linkdead in a dragon<br/>
raid. Generally the rule of thumb is to use no more than 24 people, and<br/>
to kill the dragon in 1 wave. If you need reinforcements, have them<br/>
waiting outside the dragon&#39;s lair.<br/>
