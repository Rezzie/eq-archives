<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069851309">Uh, Dirkson&#39;s point was that adding more money wasn&#39;t necessarily a good<br/>
idea just because the amount you were adding was seemingly insignificant.<br/>
Just because you have a free 18 pt damage shield doesn&#39;t make the choice to<br/>
add another 9 pointer on top of it any more sound.  If you can do more<br/>
damage another way its&#39; still better than adding that 9 point damage shield.<br/>

&quot;12 points here, 9 points there, 6 points stacked... pretty soon we are<br/>
talking a pretty nice damage shield!&quot;<br/>

p.s. was it the Hon. Everrt Dirkson (sp?) senior senator from the great<br/>
state of IL who said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A billion dollars here, a billion dollars there, pretty soon we are talking<br/>
about some serious money...&quot;</div>
