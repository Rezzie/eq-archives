<div id="ygrps-yiv-724056039">Anyone look at their demon claws lately?<br/>
<br/>
i haven&#39;t used mine in a few levels, and i happened to right-click on mine<br/>
this morning at the bank, and they are now called Bloody Thulian Claws or<br/>
something (maybe not claws, but definitely Blood Thulian thingies).  dunno<br/>
if this is old news, but i just noticed it.<br/>
