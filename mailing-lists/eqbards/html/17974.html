the mid-week patch last week, and how it was done.  The uber-players in <br/>
my guild are of the opinion that he&#39;s been bumped to L63.  Their <br/>
consensus is that Cazic Thule is a pansy compared to the new improved <br/>
Maestro.  I&#39;m sure this opinion has nothing to do with the fact that he <br/>
smoked us twice.  ;)<br/>
