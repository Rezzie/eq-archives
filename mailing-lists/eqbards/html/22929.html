<div id="ygrps-yiv-492323568"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So, why did you start playing a Bard?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I play a Bard in a long-running (now in it&#39;s 14th year) AD&D campaign.  When<br/>
EQ first came out, I thought long and hard about what class I&#39;d play.  An<br/>
Enchanter friend told me that she&#39;d seen lots and lots of other classes, but<br/>
hardly any Bards.<br/>
<br/>
But honestly, the thing that sealed it for me was when she told me that one<br/>
of the developers had a soft spot for Bards.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still happy with my choice, though.  The day I stop playing my Bard is<br/>
the day I stop playing EQ.<br/>
