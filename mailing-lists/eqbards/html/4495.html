<div id="ygrps-yiv-2084318972"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Who the hell is this Murissa Sandwhisperer person?  I was jaunting back to<br/>
&gt; Freeport after killing some crocs the other day and assumed she was a vendor<br/>
&gt; (like in E. Commons, where they are consistently not in the inns but rather<br/>
&gt; in front of them or on top of them....still haven&#39;t figured that out yet)<br/>
&gt; and she screamed something at me just before she quadruple whacked me for<br/>
&gt; 127hp per slap.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She is aligned with the Dervish Cutthroats. Kill enough of them and she won&#39;t like you.  I<br/>
found this out the hard way also:-)<br/>
