&gt; &gt;Yes it can be done. Is the group as effective without an enchanter? Not<br/>
&gt; &gt;by a long shot. Why should one class have the monopoly on bringing that<br/>

&gt; is a group with a druid or shaman as healer as effective as one without a cleric?<br/>

group that never had a cleric in it but did have an enchanter and it<br/>
rocked. When you only have to deal with one mob in a fight, ever, a<br/>
cleric is actually a waste of a spot pre 50.<br/>

Crowd control is the most powerful skill in the game and it&#39;s the<br/>
exclusive domain of the enchanter.<br/>
