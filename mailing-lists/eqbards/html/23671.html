<div id="ygrps-yiv-707931773">I am looking for some information from people who have hunted here. (I<br/>
can&#39;t seem to find anyone on my server that has...)<br/>
<br/>
I am looking to get some Guardian Armor, and am wondering what kind of<br/>
fights I am looking at.<br/>
<br/>
What level group will I need?<br/>
Easy to pull Singles?<br/>
<br/>
That sort of stuff...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for any information you have.</div>
