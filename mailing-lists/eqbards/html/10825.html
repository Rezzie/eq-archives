<div id="ygrps-yiv-848029299">I have heard that RADIANT in CT sees invis, maybe you ran afoul of<br/>
him/her. She is usualy in the maze with all the others. I know that<br/>
Defenders and Warders do not see invis, as well as all th lizzies in the<br/>
TR (since i often invis by them all to look to see if the Tae Ew Templar<br/>
is in).<br/>

&gt; Hmmm, maybe it&#39;s my perfume? Or my religion? Rodcet Nife.  Or my bad luck<br/>
&gt; and invis dropped for a tick.  But definitely some lizzies see me.<br/>
&gt; Defenders?  Watchmen?  <br/>
