&gt; Sounds more like packet loss to me, also some zones seem to have always had <br/>
&gt; this &#39;feature&#39;. Qeynos Hills comes to mind, as does West Karana.  In WK a <br/>
&gt; few days back I was transfromed into a bloody grass stain while attempting <br/>
&gt; to pit Choon against Froon, when they both &#39;teleported&#39; on top of me.<br/>

mob in a room in lower guk and having 6 more teleport in.  That would be<br/>
some pretty wicked packet loss to miss that many coming in the door.<br/>
