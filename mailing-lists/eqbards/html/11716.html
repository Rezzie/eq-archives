<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121053883">They seem to have fixed levitation, but I noticed that every time I<br/>
fired up Selo&#39;s and ran any distance of any sort, my fatigue bar started<br/>
to drop pretty rapidly.  I didn&#39;t make any really long runs, but if I<br/>
have to start resting now when using our speed song, it&#39;s going to<br/>
really tick me off.  Has anyone else noticed this?<br/>
