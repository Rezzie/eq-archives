<div id="ygrps-yiv-85263817">This would be pretty cool. I suggest when we make our gnome characters,<br/>
we all have the same prefix in our name. Such as I could be Zixorbob,<br/>
and the next person could be Zixorjoe (just an example of course).<br/>
<br/>
Also running thru Nektulos could be tricky with the Stone/Iron guardians<br/>
around.<br/>
