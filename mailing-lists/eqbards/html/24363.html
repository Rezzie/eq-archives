<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099493055">i have been to kaesora once with a full group of lvl 40 people, we had a<br/>
ranger, cleric, enchanter, bard (me), monk and a druid, and we did very fine<br/>
camping the library, the area behind the library and the hut. just be<br/>
careful and pull slowly, keep the crowd under control. the most nasty<br/>
problem there are the warders, that start to heal from a long distance and<br/>
tend to aggro afterwards, running a long way to your group and bringing a<br/>
lot of friends. just keep your eyes peeled for warders, if you can control<br/>
them, you control the library.<br/>
be safe all, take care!<br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>
