<div id="ygrps-yiv-429211912"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Heck, I&#39;ve even had something cast at me through the walls<br/>
&gt; while I was in Lesser Faydark standing right next to the<br/>
&gt; Mistmoore zone.  I know this is supposed to be impossible, and<br/>
&gt; I wouldn&#39;t have believed it if it hadn&#39;t happened to me.<br/>
&gt; Something with a Mistmoore-ish name behind the walls tagged me<br/>
&gt; with tashan and a DD.  I moved away from the zone and it<br/>
&gt; stopped casting at me.<br/>

of the mistmoore casters are SK&#39;s, Necro&#39;s or Wizards.</div>
