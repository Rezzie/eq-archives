&gt; Actually, I&#39;m ALMOST positive that you don&#39;t need to target your corpse for<br/>

&gt; corpse that you want to drag.<br/>

own corpse, because I almost always play my bard, and my own<br/>
corpse recoveries are almost always done with Locating Lyric,<br/>
and so my corpse is almost always targeted.<br/>
