<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943862531">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Writing again to garner any information you all may have on the ball room<br/>
(or gypsy room) in MM.<br/>
<br/>
Most specifically I&#39;d like to find out what level range you suggest is<br/>
necessary to break and take the room, as well as any tips on breaking and<br/>
holding the room long enough to pick up a MM drum, and some lutes.<br/>
