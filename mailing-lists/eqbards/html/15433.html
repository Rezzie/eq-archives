&gt; Grouping is best.  Best exp 35-40 is Mistmoore.  You can get<br/>
&gt; about a bubble every hour or two there with a competent group<br/>
&gt; that knows how to work around the bugs in the zone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please expound on this. I did the outer part of Mistmoore at 25 but<br/>
never went back. Where do you hunt 35-40? Is it doable on a new server?<br/>
In other words with one group and few other high level people in the<br/>
zone?<br/>
