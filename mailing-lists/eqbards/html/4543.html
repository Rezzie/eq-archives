<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lower guk off ghoul lord, level 47 or 48, has 2 harm touches about 480dmg<br/>
each, 2 level 45 to 46 guards. Need minimum 6 level 45 to 50 players with<br/>
enchanter or 10 to 12 level 45 to 50 without enchanter.<br/>
<br/>
Mithril Armor<br/>
<br/>
Solusek B, chest off kobold priest, bracers off kobold king.  Arms and legs<br/>
also available but most likely on named fire giants which require multiple<br/>
groups, though that is just a guess.<br/>
<br/>
Adamantite Armor<br/>
<br/>
only know of epolets (shoulders) from lower guk, good for hybrid casters<br/>
(add wisdom)<br/>
