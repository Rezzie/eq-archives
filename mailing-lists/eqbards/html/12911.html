<div id="ygrps-yiv-265459958">There are no secrets, just time.  Deaths don&#39;t hurt any more than normal<br/>
levels.  If you find something that is easy and safe, and plentiful<br/>
that is probably the best thing around. <br/>
<br/>
This is the same advice I give all the time, find a nice &quot;low blue&quot;, <br/>
get a group and kill lots of them.  For one specific place,<br/>
might try the 4c&#39;s area of cazic.  Don&#39;t group here with people that<br/>
aren&#39;t familiar (well, take 1 newbie under your wing), and make<br/>
sure you have 6 people in the group if possible.</div>
