&gt; <br/>
&gt; It has recently come to my attention that there are two <br/>
&gt; special instruments <br/>
&gt; that I did not know existed in game.  They are called &quot;Drum <br/>
&gt; of Selo&#39;s March&quot; <br/>
&gt; and &quot;Brahm&#39;s Horn&quot;.  I was wondering if anyone had any <br/>
&gt; information on where <br/>
&gt; these items can be obtained. </span></blockquote></div>
