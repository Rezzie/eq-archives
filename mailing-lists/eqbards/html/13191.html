<div id="ygrps-yiv-181988082">Could anyone tell me how to move my open bag window around on my<br/>
screen?  I cannot seem to figure out how to do it, but I do it by<br/>
accident at least once a night...<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to find a way to free up my hot keys a little bit on my<br/>
&quot;swap&quot; bank, and this would allow me to do it (freeing up the INV spots<br/>
I have on it...)<br/>
