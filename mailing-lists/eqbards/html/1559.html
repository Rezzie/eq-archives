<div id="ygrps-yiv-586027427">I&#39;m an 18th level Bard on CZ. I was just curious if anybody had specific<br/>
stats on the damage done using Denons Disruptive Cord. Also, does the<br/>
damage inflicted increase with your level, your brass skill or both. I<br/>
overheard  a 21 level bard say that she does 79 hp worth of damage with<br/>
this song per pulse when using her horn. I failed to ask her how she<br/>
arrived at this figure, but now that I have the song (which does work<br/>
pretty good), I wish I had. Anybody have the answer to this?<br/>
