&gt; Hmm, while it&#39;s fun to group with 50&#39;s (and 40&#39;s) - you can forget about xp.<br/>
&gt; First off the mobs can be too red for you to get xp when the group kills<br/>
&gt; them and if they are not too red and there are lots of higher lev&#39;s - they<br/>
&gt; will get the lion&#39;s share of xp and you will get little. ..<br/>

before opening this one up.  For a minute, I thought you were psychic!  )<br/>
