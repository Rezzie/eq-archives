<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087618209">45 is about right, but it depends on what the raid needs.  If they are short<br/>
bards, then you can go early...  I don&#39;t know how things are on Rodcet these<br/>
days but the the last couple vox/naggy raids I went to on Veeshan were<br/>
absolute nightmares.  After the last (where we lost, which is ABSURD with<br/>
the equipment out there these days), I stayed up all night just to get 53 so<br/>
I wouldnt be tempted to go back to the next attempt the next day.  I chuckle<br/>
when I think to myself these are the people who will be attempting fear<br/>
breaks soon...</div>
