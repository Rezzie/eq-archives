&gt; I hear that those names are bestowed by a Guide or GM on those who upon<br/>
&gt; reaching their 20th level call for such service.  And just last night I met<br/>
&gt; someone who chose not to have a surname (cant believe he could not find a GM<br/>
&gt; for 13 levels &lt;g&gt;). </span></blockquote></div>
