<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712273649">The Sidewinder software came with my gamepad.  You might be able to download<br/>
it somewhere on the web.  Check Microsoft first and then go from there.<br/>
There is both a Sidewinder gamepad and a Sidewinder Pro.  I think only the<br/>
pro model ships with the software.</div>
