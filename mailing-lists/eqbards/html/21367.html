<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071664461">Slyde, you have trouble charming? I use charm all the time, and have saved<br/>
our group by keeping a chromodrake under control when he invited himself to<br/>
our wyvern party more than once. I charm in chardok alot too, just have MR<br/>
trouble out of the manglers. I wonder what the difference is, that I do<br/>
fairly well with charm and you have trouble. I don&#39;t have particularly high<br/>
charis, and don&#39;t use special gear for charming.<br/>

PS. Sorry about Chardok the other night, monk misjudged his aggro and one<br/>
mangler went to get his pals on the way in.</div>
