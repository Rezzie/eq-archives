&gt; actually i bet john kim knows at what points selo&#39;s becomes faster,<br/>
&gt; whether<br/>
&gt; based on level, percussion skill, or both.  i am pretty sure level<br/>
&gt; comes<br/>
&gt; into it because a 50 bard is definitely faster than a 41 bard both<br/>

&gt; &gt; Shada says she&#39;ll race me and we can see what the difference<br/>
&gt; &gt; is between 47+Selo&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; drum and 50+MM drum.  I want to leave her in the dust!  (LOL Shada).<br/>
