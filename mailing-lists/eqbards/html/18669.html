<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055592289">Ahhh yes, the naked spawn dance.  I know it well.  This is where you stand<br/>
right where a named mob is due to spawn, strip off all your clothing so you<br/>
are vulnerable to his first whack once he spawns, and do a little dance.<br/>
This method is extremely effective in making the named mob spawn instead of<br/>
placeholders.  I suggest you all try it.<br/>

The wind instrument animation is the one that I know of....<br/>
Combine that with the<br/>
/dance<br/>
animation to do what you will.  I personally use a wind instrument<br/>
rather than the /Dance when required (Like the naked spawn dance to make<br/>
the monsters appear...  Don&#39;t ask  &gt;Grin&lt; )<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps...<br/>
