 </span></blockquote>Good comment.  I&#39;ve noticed this too.  It&#39;s a line-of-sight song, like<br/>
Lugubrious Lament, but it doesn&#39;t give you a message if it fails<br/>
(and you wouldn&#39;t normally think that a counter blocks line-of-sight).<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, if you don&#39;t get the &quot;wave of enchantment&quot; message, the<br/>
Carrilion hasn&#39;t worked.  Pay no attention to the pretty blue light -<br/>
it&#39;s the text message that counts.<br/>

PS: Tonight&#39;s record for accidently Lullaby&#39;ed things: Three Young Kodiaks,<br/>
    a Will-o-Wisp, a Skeleton, a Darkweed Snake and a Plains Cat, all<br/>
    happily nodding away.  After the battle, I noticed several people<br/>
    watching me, all of which wanted to know how I survived...<br/>
    Ain&#39;t Barding grand?</div>
