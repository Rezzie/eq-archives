<b>Subject:</b> Questions about Clarity (mana song) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-444572248">Hello everyone.  Recently I read a post online claiming that this<br/>
song does not last for a certain ticks like all our other buff songs do.  <br/>
(For example, you can twist healing, jig, anthem on a good day without<br/>
losing any song effect)  However, that person claims that the effect of<br/>
clarity kicks in whenever the message &quot;your mind clears&quot; is displayed and<br/>
as soon as you stop singing the song, it no longer helps mana regen.  Can<br/>
anyone confirm this?  I&#39;ve always twisted clarity with healing to minimize<br/>
downtime, but if clarity does have this rather unique property, I might<br/>
have to change my tactics.  I wonder why this song does not display an<br/>
icon like all our other buff songs do.<br/>
	I would also love to find out whether clarity gives a<br/>
caster a certain amount of mana back per pulse or double his/her amount of<br/>
mana gained while medding.  I have heard reports that multiple bards in a<br/>
party can all sing this song to super charge mana for casters.  Does that<br/>
one instance of one bard song per party rule not aply to this song either?</div>
