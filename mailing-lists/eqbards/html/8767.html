<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529935150">Greetings all,<br/>
<br/>
I have a Dragoon Dirk and have boosted my piercing to around 60 (out of 80). I find that I still like the secure feeling of my heavy, slow mino axe for big stuff. I&#39;m planning to put the dirk in my off hand when I hit 17 and want something magical for the primary. The barbed leather whip seems to have good stats.<br/>
<br/>
Questions:<br/>
<br/>
1) How much should I auction for it and where? (I know it comes out of Najena)<br/>
<br/>
2) Is it better bang for the buck than a combine ls or scim?<br/>
<br/>
3) Do I have a chance at skipping it and camping for a PGT before 20?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
