<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635992037"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Actually his statement is exactly right.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps I should have added a ;) at the end of my comment to indicate<br/>
sarcasm.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fully aware that it&#39;s our songs that define our class and my songs are<br/>
memorised dynamically to compliment the abilities of the group I&#39;m in.<br/>
Depending on the make-up of the group, I&#39;m almost exclusively singing with<br/>
an instrument equipped during combat, hot-swapping and twisting as<br/>
necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Defining characteristic or not, at lower levels (up to the mid-teens and<br/>
often beyond) a Bard&#39;s time is spent meleeing whilst singing.  To dismiss<br/>
Bards from melee discussion because it &quot;doesn&#39;t define us&quot; perhaps shows a<br/>
lack of comprehension of a Bard&#39;s abilities and how one is played.</div>
