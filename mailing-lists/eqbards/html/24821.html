<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519640214">Leadership means nothing when the people there don&#39;t listen to commands.<br/>
Maybe Veeshan is the exception in this case, but I have seen the leader of<br/>
one of our most powerful guilds fail on a Vox run due to complete<br/>
incompetence of the people there.  If people had at all been able to follow<br/>
directions, I wouldn&#39;t be sitting around with my thumb up my butt waiting<br/>
for my guild to get enough resist gear to down Gone.  (I have pretty much<br/>
everything else done).  Bitter?<br/>
