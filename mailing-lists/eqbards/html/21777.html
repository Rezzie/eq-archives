<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510983833">one of my system&#39;s has a geforce 256 DDR which i love.  the other has a<br/>
voodoo3 3000 which i hate, hate, hate.  i can&#39;t afford another DDR, so i am<br/>
looking for a cheap upgrade.  anyone know if i will get a substantial<br/>
upgrade going to a geforce 256 SDR or a geforce 2 MX, and which to choose?<br/>
thanks.<br/>
