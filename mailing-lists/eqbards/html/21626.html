<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787214912">note that the head you want is off the doppleganger that spawns after you<br/>
give him the note.  we actually root/atoned marigal and pulled his doppleganger<br/>
away to kill him.<br/>
<br/>
and we used that charm thing to give him the note.  he will break charm as soon<br/>
as you give him the note and the doppleganger will spawn, so be ready.</div>
