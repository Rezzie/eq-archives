Makes me laugh when I look back at all those times as a newbie fighting in<br/>
nro fighting with my lute in my hand. Once I realized I was only punching<br/>
the creature, I&#39;d promptly switch to my weap and throw in an emote &quot;Windleaf<br/>
bonks the orc with his lute.&quot; Then after the fight &quot;Windleaf retunes his<br/>
lute.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone understood why I would sing, &quot;My dog has fleas&quot; when<br/>
doing this. Maybe they were all too young. :-)<br/>
