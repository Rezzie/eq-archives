<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556549786">I have a cable modem, so the patching won&#39;t be too awful.  My roomate<br/>
started in November, and it wasn&#39;t too bad then.  I was more concerned<br/>
withg losing all my hot keys and such.  Between my cleric and bard and I<br/>
have almost the entire bank of socials and all 6 hot key banks filled<br/>
now.  It will be a pain to redo them all...  Well I get the new toy<br/>
today, so we&#39;ll see how it goes...<br/>
