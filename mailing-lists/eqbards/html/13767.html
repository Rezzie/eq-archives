<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724639449">Was fighting casters last night and noticed that<br/>
they have added a message for the second resist on<br/>
pixie strike.  It now says something like, &quot;yada<br/>
yada resists your attempt to mezmerise them.&quot;  It<br/>
looks like a total hack, however, as you STILL get<br/>
the &quot;So and so&#39;s eyes glaze over.&quot;  In addition,<br/>
this second resist message is in BLUE, so it&#39;s<br/>
very hard to see.  Haven&#39;t these guys ever heard<br/>
the phrase that it&#39;s better to take the time to do<br/>
it right than to have to do it over?<br/>
