<div id="ygrps-yiv-464913161">Ooops, deleted the first message, but ... the backstab, whether it<br/>
hits or not will cause an immediate &quot;taunt&quot;, but the monster will hop<br/>
right back to the bard unless the rogue can do a large amount of damage.<br/>
And a lot of that damage can be done on the backstab...<br/>
<br/>
This just from my experience, although I admit I have had limited<br/>
grouping with rogues.</div>
