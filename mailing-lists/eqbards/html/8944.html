<b>Subject:</b> Resist on chains gotten worse lately? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-768483036">Last night the Cerf.net servers all went down so I logged into Tarrew<br/>
Marr to play my bard for the first time in a while. I decided to go see<br/>
if I could kill some hill giants in W Commons and while looking ran<br/>
across Kizdean Gix. He attacked dispite being 20 odd levels below me and<br/>
I fired up chains intending to chain and fear him. Hmm. 8 resists in a<br/>
row. After killing him and determining there weren&#39;t any hill giants in<br/>
the zone, I happened to spot some big wisp spawns and killed them.<br/>
Again, wisps were resisting chains like crazy. Have resist rates gone up<br/>
on chains lately? I don&#39;t remember having near this much trouble last<br/>
time I played my bard. My druid can get snare to stick on reds with more<br/>
reliability than this.<br/>
