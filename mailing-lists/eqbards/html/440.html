<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845667649">Roop--I also chose Brewing and Alcohol Tolerance for my Bard.  I made Mead with a 70%<br/>
success rate but got very frustrated when I could not drink it.  Thanks for explaining<br/>
that it is consumed like water!  Not even the GM&#39;s I petitioned understood that.  I<br/>
have not experimented much with consuming alcohol yet, because I wanted to make my own<br/>
first.  I found a list of alcohol recipes at eqvault (in poem form appropriately).  I<br/>
could not find the Brewing Manual.  I looked for it all over Faydwer, in Freeport, and<br/>
Rivervale.  I found out I needed a shot glass in order to drink hard liquor.<br/>
