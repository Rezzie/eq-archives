&gt; Alright, ive yet to find out why nobody has posted any information about <br/>
&gt; this song. In addition to cold based protection, it acts as a fireshield for <br/>
&gt; everybody in the group. Everytime a monster hits you, they get damage done <br/>
&gt; to them, at lvl 40 the damage is 6. Great song while fighting multiple <br/>
&gt; monsters, and is in someways better than discord since it doesnt concentrate <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is *great* to know!  I&#39;d been wondering what the point<br/>
was to this song since at L25 when I got it, Elemental Rhythms<br/>
gave me 2 points more cold resist, and boosted my fire and<br/>
magic resist as well, with just 4 fewer AC.<br/>
