<div id="ygrps-yiv-512095836">I run Everquest on a Dell Inspiron 7000.  It zones very slowly, and is also <br/>
slow during the first few moments in a new zone (overloaded drawing the <br/>
graphics?), but other than that it&#39;s fine.  The main drawback is the lack <br/>
of a separate keypad for movement.<br/>
