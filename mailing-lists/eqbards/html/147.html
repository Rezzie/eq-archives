<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1397932093">I just hit level 7 and purchased Jonthan&#39;s Whistling Warsong because I do a lot of soloing.  I memorized and started it up and to my disappointment I didn&#39;t notice a great skill boost.  In fact it only gave me 2 more strength than the Chant of Battle and didn&#39;t give me any dex bonus.  Is it really worth using.  Even if I have both songs going at the same time I don&#39;t notice any difference in my fighting ability.  I seem to do better if I just keep playing the Hymn of Restoration.  Am I missing something or did I just waste my platinum?<br/>
