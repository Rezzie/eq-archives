If they make all the undead despawn at dawn, I think that would solve the<br/>
problem.  Just don&#39;t enter the place at night. :)<br/>

re: new zone locations<br/>
The badlads in the Dakotas are quite interesting, terrain wise. Be nice if<br/>
they reproduced something like that.<br/>
Dead Hills.. hopefully that doens&#39;t refer to players.  heheh.<br/>
Is there a zone that encompasses the Unkempt Woods or the Jaggedpine forest?<br/>
I&#39;m guessing the unkempt druids are in the unkempt woods (living in unkempt<br/>
houses, no doubt).<br/>
<br/>
The Ruins of Kunark is supposed to have 20 zones in it or so I&#39;ve heard.<br/>
Unfortunately it won&#39;t be out until March of next year.  By which time,<br/>
unless they&#39;ve added new zones, half the server population will be level 50<br/>
with nothing to do. :)<br/>
