<div id="ygrps-yiv-741690701">One item you left out was the opalline earring.  The undead barkeep in<br/>
Unrest sometimes drops it.  It gives +5 CHR and 2AC.  The barkeep also drops<br/>
a thick leather apron.  He is on the 3d floor so you will need a good group<br/>
in order to camp the room.  It can get tough in there.<br/>
