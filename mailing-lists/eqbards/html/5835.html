&gt;Did anyone else notice the &quot;you feel as if you are about to<br/>
&gt;become visible&quot; message with invisibility?  Of course Clouding<br/>
&gt;pulsed again before I became visible.  I have to wonder if<br/>
&gt;this fix (message 5 sec before invisibility blinks off) didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;just make Clouding 100% reliable...<br/>
