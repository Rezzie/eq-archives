<div id="ygrps-yiv-300687543">I&#39;d like to add a list of Bard-only, or Bard-special weapons for the FAQ, <br/>
similar to the instrument list.  This need not be exhaustive, but I would <br/>
certainly like a few of the better choices, along with what they do, where <br/>
they are found, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
