<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148913602">A touch of sarcasm on the Lullaby comment?  :)  I think you&#39;ll be surprised.  I was playing a lower (20s)<br/>
level Bard when the thing was nerfed, and honestly, I had no clue what all the higher level Bards were<br/>
complaining about.  The song&#39;s designed to work pretty well at the level you get it, and given the<br/>
relative mob/pc power at that level, it&#39;s a pretty nice song.  For awhile.<br/>
