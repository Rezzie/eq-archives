<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949136519">One more thing I learned in Hate. Since I was not using my drum most <br/>
of the time, I memorized psalms to help with PR (rats) and DR <br/>
(mummies). These worked well to buff the associated resist, but I <br/>
don&#39;t think either one of them could cure the fleas from my dog!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am pretty certain the poison or disease will run its course before <br/>
it is healed with a psalm. *Smiles*<br/>
