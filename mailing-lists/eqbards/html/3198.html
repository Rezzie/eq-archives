<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670086022">Fellow Bards,<br/>
     <br/>
          I&#39;ve been off for awhile so excuse me if this topic has been <br/>
     beaten to death already.  <br/>
     <br/>
          Which is better;  using a good shield (SBS or darkwood for <br/>
     example) or using dual wield?  I&#39;m approaching 17th and have even <br/>
     procured a Dragoon dirk in anticipation of dual wield but my friend <br/>
     feels it is more advantageous to carry my SB shield saying that the <br/>
     additions damage form the occasional (why?) second strike does not <br/>
     outweigh the defensive bonus of the shield.   I end up tanking about <br/>
     half the time so this is an important question. <br/>
          My friend was on beta so I usually trust his judgment. (And he is <br/>
     also one of those power gamer types that always calculates everything <br/>
     to the nth degree.) <br/>
          <br/>
          So let me know what you all think.  Shield or dirk?<br/>
     <br/>
         On another note &quot;Elf skin gloves&quot; !!!  eeuch!  Isn&#39;t that a bit <br/>
     grisly.  Don&#39;t know if I could bring myself to wear them,  I&#39;ve <br/>
     adventured with too many elves, I would feel guilty.    <br/>
