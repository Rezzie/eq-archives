<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718757990">i tihnk you need at least 7 to 12 more levels before you go after your own<br/>
drum.<br/>
<br/>
here is my take on your trade...  bad idea.<br/>
<br/>
mm drums go for 500 to 1000pp.  a paw of opalla goes for 10000pp.  yes 10k.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; What is the consensus?  Is this a fair trade?  Be it known <br/>
&gt; that I&#39;ve camped<br/>
&gt; Paw pieces for approximately 25 hours and had to get my <br/>
&gt; baking skill up as<br/>
&gt; well (and we bards are the brightest bunch).  At 28th I think that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; approaching the level that I would expect to be able to get a <br/>
&gt; MM Battle Drum<br/>
&gt; with my own group.  Is this correct?<br/>
