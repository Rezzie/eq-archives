<div id="ygrps-yiv-146360748">I saw The Priestezza underneath Kelethin and I was wondering who she is. I <br/>
was playing a high elf cleric at the time. There was a gnome there that <br/>
couldn&#39;t see her. I tried to hail her and giving her copper but nothing <br/>
happened. Please tell me if you have any info.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
