<br/>
I have a newbie question to ask.  I have recently gained Level 12 and have<br/>
been experimeting with bellow.  I had a few questions such as: is it a DD or<br/>
AE song and if I bellow one creature can it effect others such that they<br/>
will follow along and attack me.  I wanted to know a little about the<br/>
possible strategies that people use with this song.  Thanks for all your<br/>
help.<br/>
