<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300817187">It defintily was, it my time running around Quenos, getting my funeral<br/>
shroud ready, My percussion skill hit 201!!!  Neat...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if any of you want to attend my &quot;funeral&quot;, it is Saturday 11pm<br/>
Central time, at the top of the East Karana ramp, Veeshan server.<br/>
Its not so much of a funeral as a departing of the realms (kind of like the<br/>
elves in Tollkein)</div>
