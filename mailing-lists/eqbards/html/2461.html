Innoruuk server, I&#39;d have to safely say no.<br/>
<br/>
No food, no matter what I made, from edible goo to beer braised lion<br/>
steaks to troll cookies to vegetable soup ever lasted any longer or helped<br/>
heal any faster.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, food is just for fun right now. My friends always enjoyed it<br/>
though, when they were out of food and I handed them a few beer braised<br/>
steaks.<br/>
<br/>
Not too long ago someone posted an article on EQVault explaining how<br/>
food/water consumption works in detail. It had nothing to do with the type<br/>
of food.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully in the future Verant will make different types of food be worth<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, if you want to save money, stick to muffins and milk.<br/>
