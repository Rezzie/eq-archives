<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969408438">After yesterdays patch (several bard friendly new commands there)  Its seems<br/>
they broke the &quot;Too high level to charm&quot; message.<br/>
<br/>
I was just getting the normal resist message on creature I know are too high<br/>
to charm...<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to see if anyone else found this.</div>
