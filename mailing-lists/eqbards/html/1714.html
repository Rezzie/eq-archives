<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743253999">For those detractors wondering where my image of a Bard came from, it is a<br/>
mix of fantasy and historical literature including Ambergin and Taliesin.<br/>
Also Verant&#39;s own image seems to bely wearing plate armor, we do after all<br/>
get the skills of pick locks, something no celtic bard would ever stoop to,<br/>
and sneak, try picturing that in Plate armor.</div>
