<b>Subject:</b> [eqbards] Scary Gathering rumors! <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-836986542">I snipped this from a person on the Tunare boards that went to the EQ <br/>
gathering, while not final or anything, it did strike a little fear in me :<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Levels: Present theory is that the limit is 60th. Every level after 50 is a <br/>
&quot;Hell<br/>
   level.&quot; Caster types get a spell at *each* level after 50. They wouldn&#39;t <br/>
spoil<br/>
    what the new melee skills are (a cynic might think, they haven&#39;t thought <br/>
of it<br/>
   yet?). Bard spells, the holes will be filled in the current spell list <br/>
(the missing<br/>
     levels) and they should get a song every other level in Ruins&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
The first part to the second quote is pretty common knowledge by now , but <br/>
that last part is pretty scary. If that rumor is true , or songs better rock <br/>
some serious butt , or whats the point? I can still group with lvl 60&#39;s at <br/>
51. Pretty scary stuff , oh well , there is still a good bit of time before <br/>
the expansion. We can only hope..... <br/>
