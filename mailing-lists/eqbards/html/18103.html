<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772456776">Well for better or worse I&#39;m back.  :)  I think a hiatus from eqbards stood<br/>
me in good stead.<br/>
<br/>
I have RoK installed and cannot WAIT for 5:00pm to roll around so that I can<br/>
somehow get out of Hate and go explore.  I&#39;m sincerely concerned that<br/>
getting out of Hate might be a real problem tonight with everyone in Kunark.<br/>
:)  We&#39;ll see...<br/>
