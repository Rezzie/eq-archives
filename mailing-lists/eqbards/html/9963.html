 </span></blockquote>Hey, you forgot one of my favorites:  Instill Doubt.  Not that it&#39;s <br/>
useful or anything, but it amuses the party in those boring down moments.<br/>
(The &quot;you&#39;re not scaring anybody&quot; message still cracks me up.)  I also <br/>
have fishing close to maxed, and begging at nearly 70.  With fishing I <br/>
can yank in a fish almost every cast now (which replenishes a low food <br/>
supply quite quickly).  Begging, on the other hand, stinks.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
managed to get more than a silver.  But, by Mithaniel Marr, I&#39;m gonna max <br/>
it just to see if it ever gets better!<br/>
