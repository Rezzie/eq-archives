<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934477710">Tell me about it. I have a whole backpack of stuff in my bank (fairly nice<br/>
items too) that increase wis/int. Once I go gather my raw materials - silk,<br/>
meat - whatever - I switch into my crafting outfit - it does seem to help a<br/>
lot with successes and skillgain. Now, my &#39;fighting gear&#39; is pretty<br/>
pathetic, hehe - but most sufficient for what I&#39;m liable to be taking on.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;  Since bards in general have low wis/int, lemme tell ya it&#39;s damn hard<br/>
&gt;  to raise some of these.  But I think I&#39;ve spent many a day fishing<br/>
&gt;  with my L20 buds.  Or baking fish fillets for my monk friends.  Making<br/>
&gt;  bleeding brains for people, and watching people&#39;s reaction when we<br/>
&gt;  all are drinking them.  I have a great time doing all that. </span></blockquote></div>
