<div id="ygrps-yiv-233453620">If you go to a fine<br/>
restaurant, then order food, but dislike it intensely, complain to the<br/>
chef of it&#39;s quality, then demand your money back, do you go back there<br/>
the next night for dinner, hoping the chef has miraculously changed his<br/>
cooking style to suit you?<br/>
<br/>
If you answer yes, you are either very naive or live in a very small and<br/>
secluded cave. We don&#39;t have to agree on the quality of Verant&#39;s<br/>
product, but this isn&#39;t the forum to discuss it. If you are so woefully<br/>
dissatisfied, QUIT PLAYING IT. It is a recreational thing, not a<br/>
brokerage firm that has all your money.<br/>

I have one comment Ariell.  I can choose to go to other restaurant easily.<br/>
If the restaurant in your example served the only edible food in 5000 miles<br/>
I expect you would go back the very next night and every one after that.<br/>
All the while complaining in hopes they would change.  That&#39;s the situation<br/>
in EQ.<br/>
