<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321865972">I looted a rubicite breastplate 2 nights ago. When did you notice it being taken out? Granted we looted 2 claws to begin with, but we still got the rubicite.<br/>

Oh, and for fun between spawns, duel your party! =) Nothing worse than sitting around staring at that big green ball.<br/>
WARNING: Hazardous to your health if spawn is close. Heh, I was dueling the Paladin in our party and the Avatar AND the Ceno spawned. DOH! Paladin wasted LoH (protected) on the cleric due to the duel. Like I said, Duel at your own risk. But hell, it was a lot funner than having to be bored out of our minds. At one time we had 3 separate duels going on.<br/>

&gt;Recently, the spawn on rubicite armor has been messed up. </span></blockquote></div>
