You target a single non-player, but the effect actually applies to you.  It<br/>
raises your faction with all non-players of the targets faction.  The<br/>
target glows to indicate that&#39;s the faction you got upped.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I&#39;ve observed the effect lasts until you zone or log out.<br/>
