<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294613493">im in cazic thule, my group is being hit by multiple defenders and sentinals, what do i play?sonce i got lvl 25 all ive been using is psalm, period. I havent twisted much, i find it annoying. I never seem to solo either however i am VERY excited for the charm song (if i can get my charisma up that is). Now what are the songs i should be playing? could someone plz email me a situation in which u would play different songs? i would really appreciate it. If anyone is on the povar server gimme a tell. I never seem to use DDD either, it just atracts too many mobs.<br/>
