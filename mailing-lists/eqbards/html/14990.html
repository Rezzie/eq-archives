<b>Subject:</b> Vhalen vs. the Hermit...an idea... <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-865692312">after reading through silly&#39;s essay...i had a thought...<br/>
<br/>
need 1 enchanter, high enough level to charm the Hermit<br/>
have enchanter bind oh...on the bridge in north k<br/>
bard and enchanter, NOT GROUPED go pay a visit to the hermit.<br/>
bard or enchanter entices the hermit from his hut, where the enchanter<br/>
charms him.<br/>
the three take a nice stroll over to Vhalen.<br/>
enchanter gates out, breaking charm on hermit<br/>
bard stays and observes the ensuing carnage<br/>
<br/>
since i don&#39;t have any enchanter friends high enough to charm the hermit...<br/>
why doesn&#39;t someone give this one a shot, and see what happens when they get<br/>
together &#39;naturally&#39;, with no pc&#39;s interfering with the process?<br/>
<br/>
might not do anything, if they haven&#39;t set the &#39;fight&#39; up for the two of<br/>
them, but it might be fun if they behave like bixies and goblins :)<br/>
