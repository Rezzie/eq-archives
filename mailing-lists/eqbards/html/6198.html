&gt; Depends on the piece.  The bracers I know net about 5pp (105pp<br/>
&gt; for the sapphire, 110 to sell).  But the boots are a net loss<br/>
&gt; (210pp for 2 sapphires, 158pp to sell).<br/>

the gauntlets sell to a vendor for something like 239 plat.<br/>
<br/>
They are also a nice chunk of exp, as previously stated.  Doing one gauntlet moved<br/>
my exp bar about 2 pixels at level 30, and if you&#39;ve experienced level 30, you<br/>
know that&#39;s a LOT of exp.  That&#39;s about what I&#39;d expect from killing 6-10 white or<br/>
yellow cyclopses.<br/>
