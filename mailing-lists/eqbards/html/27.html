&gt;Let&#39;s settle an debated issue while we are at it. I don&#39;t believe the Level<br/>
&gt;8 song works, at least that&#39;s what I have been hearing. All it does is say<br/>
&gt;&quot;A Skeleton Looks Sad&quot; without actually slowing him down (which I believe<br/>
&gt;is what it was supposed to do). Can anyone speak authoritatively to whether<br/>
&gt;it indeed does work?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    Have you tried the song while playing the recomended insterment (if<br/>
any)?<br/>
