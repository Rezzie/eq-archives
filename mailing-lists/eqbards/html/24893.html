** Spell and Song Changes and Bug Fixes **<br/>
<br/>
- We&#39;ve been fixing holes in the spell stacking code. For the most part the<br/>
changes fix bugs that allowed tricks to get spells to stack that were never<br/>
intended to stack.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, this is nice although I don&#39;t charm as much as I used to.<br/>
<br/>
- Increased duration on Bard Charm songs to 18 seconds from 12 seconds.<br/>
