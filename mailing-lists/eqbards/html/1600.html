 </span></blockquote>In my experience if you target a player with no corpse in the zone, you<br/>
get the same message saying that you sense a corpse in this direction,<br/>
but it does not actually turn you in any direction. Maybe you were<br/>
already pointing in that direction, and just though it was pulling you?<br/>
<br/>
They should really fix this to have the song end if there is no corpse<br/>
in the zone.</div>
