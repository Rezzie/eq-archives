<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-848054281">The dude from EQ just sent out:<br/>
<br/>
Last night we took down each server for a short time to patch a fix for<br/>
bards that couldn&#39;t sing songs. We also fixed a faction problem with wolf<br/>
form.<br/>
We are aware of other issues, and we&#39;re getting them fixed as fast as we<br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience.<br/>
