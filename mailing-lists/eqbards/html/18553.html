<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346539479">I just got to Kunark last night (had to finish some Lambent. Still can&#39;t get a group on the Rathe to<br/>
do MM for Gloves or the Gypsy lute)<br/>
<br/>
After a terrible time with the boat, I fell off the skiff. Swam to an island, took a boat to the<br/>
evil outpost and then the fun began.<br/>
<br/>
Got to see several places in Kunark and the graphics are amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Now to my question..<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions on where to hunt? Fironia Vie seemed to have a lot of black, yellow and red that could<br/>
be charm fought. Or the Swamp of No hope and Warsilik Woods looked ok as well.<br/>
<br/>
I know frontier Mt.&#39;s is an option but that requires a group I think.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions will be much appreciated.<br/>
