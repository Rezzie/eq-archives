<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766671647">To put it in the simplest terms, you have 2 (yes, only 2) &quot;pure&quot; classes<br/>
that everything else comes from:  Casters and Melee&#39;rs.  Everything else is<br/>
a hybrid of the two.<br/>
(At least the way I see it)<br/>
So therefore, any class that doesn&#39;t just melle or doesn&#39;t just cast is a<br/>
hybrid.<br/>
