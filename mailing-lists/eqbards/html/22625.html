<div id="ygrps-yiv-1046098694">There I was, driving home from work last night, and a strange thought<br/>
passed through my head...<br/>
<br/>
I read that the Brass Horn from the Sky quest could be held in one<br/>
hand while using a weapon in the other... I also read the SSS acts as<br/>
an instrument... the natural question is, &quot;what happens when you hold<br/>
both?&quot;<br/>
