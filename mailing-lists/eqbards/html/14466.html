   I&#39;m glad everyone could get a chuckle out of it.<br/>
<br/>
   I do have to admit, I play Pikachu in Super Smash Bros on the N64.<br/>
   And I kinda like the little fellow.  He has an electric personality.<br/>
<br/>
   Yesterday, I just found out that a Pikachu can grow up and become<br/>
   a Ranichu or Rainchu?  Something like that... just a more powerful<br/>
   version of the little yellow lightning ball.  It&#39;s amazing what<br/>
   children know and think they can teach you about Pokemon hehe.<br/>
<br/>
   Plus my kitten loves to wrestle pikachu stuffed toys.<br/>
<br/>
   Ok, gonna try to take some real pictures this time.<br/>
