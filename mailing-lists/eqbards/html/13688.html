<div id="ygrps-yiv-264222202">Anyone know what an Ashenwood Short Spear or Obscene Shard might reasonably<br/>
sell for?  I was thinking of picking up one or the other and wondered what I<br/>
might expect to pay.  I&#39;m still a ways from taking either of those mobs with<br/>
my own group unfortunately.  Any other ideas of what might be comparable<br/>
other than Claws?  I currently use a PGT and another weapon that varies<br/>
according to situation.<br/>
<br/>
	Thanks,<br/>
