<div id="ygrps-yiv-679886786"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; and the crown of king tranix is not no drop, i know someone who traded for<br/>
&gt; one.  what was up with that story about the cleric who looted it?  or am i<br/>
&gt; way off.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Never seen one.  I heard in one of the recent patches it was made<br/>
  nodrop.  I&#39;m fairly certain it is because the head GM was called <br/>
  down to SolB resolve the issue, and she simply destroyed the helm<br/>
  after saying she couldnt/wouldnt transfer the item.<br/>
<br/>
  All the pictures of the crown I see are a droppable item, but since<br/>
  I dont have the crown, does anyone know?<br/>
<br/>
  Harm.</div>
