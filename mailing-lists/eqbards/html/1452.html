<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978077218">I am only level 10 at the moment but i had a question about the kiting<br/>
you guys were talking about. To kite a creature, you equip a drum, hit a<br/>
creature with a bellow, start selos, start running, bellow again, selo<br/>
again, below again...etc? Also, for only pulling a few creatures from a<br/>
bunch you said you were using the Lullaby. How does the lvl 8 Lament<br/>
song stack up to it? Is one more effective than the other? Thanks.<br/>
