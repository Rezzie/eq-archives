<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015714424"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well then the problem with this is that all mages get<br/>
&gt; this spell which is also useless not to mention other<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By the time casters are level 14, most have 4 or 5 pages full<br/>
of spells. Bards get ONE song per level. If a song is fairly<br/>
useless it impacts us much more than a caster having 1 out of<br/>
~9 available spells being worthless.</div>
