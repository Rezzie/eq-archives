<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806672714">Could we construct a test to find out if cha does or does not affect the<br/>
crowd control songs?<br/>
<br/>
What would be a valid test?<br/>
<br/>
Bard finds a nice yellow Harrier (presuming they are still yellow to me - if<br/>
not then a yellow avo will do)<br/>
<br/>
40 pixie strikes with cha at lowest level (I can equip my staff of writhing<br/>
and dequip my jewels)<br/>
<br/>
40 pixie strikes with cha at or near 100 (same yellow bird - we wont attack<br/>
it just pixie it)<br/>
<br/>
40 pixie strikes with cha at max (I think mine maxes at 109 with the<br/>
boosters I currently got but maybe I can borrow some stuffs to get it up<br/>
over 110)<br/>
<br/>
Record the number of resists for each test run & figure out variation and<br/>
std deviation - then figure out if there is any significant difference?<br/>
(gee it&#39;s been a long time since I studied this stuff)<br/>
<br/>
So, you statisticians out there - is this a vaild test?<br/>
<br/>
Any other volunteers to collect data? I can get a data set for level 31.<br/>
<br/>
Any volunteer (like someone who actually knows stats) to analyze the data?<br/>
<br/>
I guess the other thing to test would be the &quot;type&quot; of mob. There was always<br/>
the 2-legs / 4-legs rumor/theory about resitability.  Wonder how the aviacks<br/>
fit in - they are animal (vs humanoid) but have 2-legs not 4-legs?<br/>
