<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101891585">I have searched all of High Hold Keep and have yet to find the song.  In my<br/>
frustration I moved out of the keep into the pass, and subsequently died to<br/>
a VERY nasty Dark Elf NPC in one of the Inns.  I realize this is requesting<br/>
a spoiler, but when I died to the NPC last night I lost my level, and am<br/>
pretty frustrated at this point.  E-mail privately if you wish. <br/>

Thanks,<br/>
