<div id="ygrps-yiv-605711079"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The juggling is EXACTLY what I do as a RL solo club musician.  It isn&#39;t the song that continues<br/>
 </span></blockquote>when you stop singing.  It&#39;s the EFFECT that the song has on you.  When I sing a sad song, the<br/>
listener doesn&#39;t stop feeling sad immediately after I stop singing.  It&#39;s this *effect* that carries<br/>
over into the next song.  If the next song is a toe-tapper, the audience may still feel a little sad<br/>
for a while even as they start tapping.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Glad somebody said this, I was thinking exactly the same thing, yup a song&#39;s effect last even when<br/>
another song starts.<br/>
