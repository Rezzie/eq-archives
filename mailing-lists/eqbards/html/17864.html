I do like his post though (maybe GZ is a bard at heart? :)<br/>

Now - I hate to go on another rant - and I guess GZ is trying to be &quot;cute&quot;<br/>
but every class gets a detailed description of their new spells - while<br/>
bards essentially get the new song&#39;s names...  Some of them you can<br/>
certainly figure out what he means - like &quot;Attack Speed verses from Vilia &quot;<br/>
but others like &quot;A few notes from Solon &quot; gives us little to no information.</div>
