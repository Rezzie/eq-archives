three or four casting mobs in Cazic.  They nodded off to sleep<br/>
probably about 50 times total, but I never saw a single<br/>
interrupt message immediately following a nods.  Did I just<br/>
get extraordinarily unlucky with my timing, did they gimp<br/>
Lullaby, or are lizards able to cast in their sleep?<br/>
