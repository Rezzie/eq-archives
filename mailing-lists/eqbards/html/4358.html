using that song before when someone really got on my nerves to clear the<br/>
damage list and then start bellowing and hitting it as hard as I can hoping<br/>
to finish it off first. As a Bard (15th song) it&#39;s the only way I know of to<br/>
keep something I&#39;m fighting from being stolen. And when you&#39;d much rather be<br/>
playing songs to improve your speed or AC or something, that&#39;s a real<br/>
bummer.</div>
