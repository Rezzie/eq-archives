<div id="ygrps-yiv-456720270">Depends on the number of MOBs.  If I have to mez more than one, I use the Lute since I can twist Cantata<br/>
in that way without instrument swapping, which is a pain if you have to retarget also (doesn&#39;t apply if<br/>
you aren&#39;t 55 yet).  With just one, I use whatever I would use for songs or weapons otherwise (with one,<br/>
probably two if I wasn&#39;t lazy, you can mez then use weapons on the primary, just don&#39;t hit your mez guy<br/>
when you retarget).  The resists are awfully low on this Song, and it lasts longer than the normal song<br/>
cycle (don&#39;t tell Verant).  I wouldn&#39;t worry about using the wind instrument with it unless you have a 4+<br/>
pull, and even then I&#39;ve never bothered.<br/>
