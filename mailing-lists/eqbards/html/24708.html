 How&#39;d you hear ?<br/>
 And where are you in your epic quest ?<br/>
<br/>
..I have all the minor stuff done but held up on Maligar&#39;s head because<br/>
of the reports he has been taking the note but note spawning the<br/>
Doppleganger. My next step will be to camp in the Hole, but the really<br/>
nice thing about getting the scale is I can finally stop worrying about<br/>
getting level 53 an look forward to the Song of Twilight :)<br/>
<br/>
 Tuesday I head to Idaho to help out with my new grandchild so will be<br/>
off line for a week.<br/>
<br/>
 Later,<br/>
