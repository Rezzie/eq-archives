<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503801802">I was concerned that when in dark elf form I would be attacked by the guards<br/>
and inhabitants of the good aligned cities I am normally looked upon kindly<br/>
or warmly by, but this is not the case.  Apparently you keep all your<br/>
faction adjustments while under the dark elf illusion of the guise.<br/>
<br/>
My question is, is it useful in any way to by disguised as a dark elf when<br/>
attempting to enter the evil aligned cities or is the mask&#39;s illusion just<br/>
some nice eye-candy that gives you infravision?<br/>
