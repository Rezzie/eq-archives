<div id="ygrps-yiv-578673048"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Unlike UO, there&#39;s a limit to how many items each character<br/>
&gt;can have.  You have your personal inventory, bank inventory,<br/>
&gt;worn items, and that&#39;s it.  Assuming you have all your<br/>
&gt;inventory full of 10 slot backpacks and chock full of items,<br/>
&gt;that&#39;s 160 items per character.  Call it 180 to account for<br/>
&gt;worn items.  Assume all 8 character slots are used in this<br/>
&gt;manner.  That&#39;s 1440 items per player.  Assume 5000 players<br/>
&gt;per server all doing this, and that&#39;s 7.2 million items as a<br/>
&gt;close-to-worst-case scenario.  If each item has 1k of data<br/>
&gt;associated with it, that&#39;s roughly 7 GB.  My PC&#39;s hard drive<br/>
&gt;is bigger than that.<br/>
