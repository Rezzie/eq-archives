<div id="ygrps-yiv-571450375">The Singing Steel Gauntlets have an &#39;always on&#39; effect.  You don&#39;t have to<br/>
right click them.  As far as I&#39;m aware, SS Gaunts will work on a level 1<br/>
Bard.<br/>
<br/>
I got the Gauntlets at 40 and they work fine.<br/>

right click effects. If someone is going to use the entry level area they<br/>
are really better off just making friends with a shaman, druid or ranger.<br/>
Rebreathers and waterstones are great as well. The problem with bringing a<br/>
mage down there is that soon they realize they don&#39;t need help.<br/>
