<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678098396">dunno what to say.  i dunno if anything was changed, i&#39;m always too lazy to<br/>
test stuff.  maybe my tanks are really good at taunting or my clerics are<br/>
good at healing me.  i just know that a couple months ago i was told to stop<br/>
playing songs during pulls and this week i was told not to worry about it.<br/>
i haven&#39;t noticed getting gangbanged while playing mana song or buffs during<br/>
pulls, and i&#39;m not dying more than anyone else up there.  not arguing or<br/>
saying anyone is wrong, just that i am not noticing it.<br/>

&gt; my experience...<br/>
