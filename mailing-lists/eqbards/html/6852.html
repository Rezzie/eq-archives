<div id="ygrps-yiv-82527116">I&#39;ve got over 40 training points saved up for lack of a better thing to<br/>
spend them on.  Looks like I might have to expend a few to play around with<br/>
this skill:-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Heh well a guild member in my old guild had got begging up to 100 and was<br/>
&gt; easily getting 6pp a beg. Not sure if he got it any further but you never<br/>
&gt; know it&#39;s worth trying.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; have read that Begging at &quot;high levels&quot; can give items; I have also read<br/>
&gt; that Bards get a Begging advantage (whether this is simply from<br/>
&gt; charisma/Carillon, or some other Bard-specific<br/>
&gt; advantage was not clear).  My question is this:  have any Bards out there<br/>
&gt; been nuts enough to get Begging<br/>
&gt; high enough to tell me whether it is worth my while?  Begging has a REALLY<br/>
&gt; slow recycle rate, and (if memory<br/>
&gt; servers) it only improves when successful.  Although it&#39;s fun to do in<br/>
&gt; front of other players (who can see<br/>
&gt; the target yell at me and give me something, but don&#39;t know what the<br/>
&gt; something is), I would rather not waste<br/>
&gt; more time on the skill if it is as useless as I suspect.  Anyone know? </span></blockquote></div>
