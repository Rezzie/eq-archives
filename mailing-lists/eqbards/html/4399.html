sitting spellcaster and attacked him, not you.  Your song<br/>
pulsed and the gnoll saw you &quot;casting&quot; a beneficial spell on<br/>
the caster, thus upgrading you to the top of its hate list<br/>
(since the caster&#39;s only offense was sitting).  With you on<br/>
the top of its hate list, the gnoll attacked you.<br/>
<br/>
This will happen over and over throughout your life.  Be<br/>
especially wary of it if you&#39;re grouped with people of lower<br/>
level than you (green stuff that normally wouldn&#39;t attack you<br/>
will), or if you&#39;re grouped with someone who has faction<br/>
problems (e.g. take a dark elf to the Freeport docks with<br/>
invisibility, he becomes visible, guards attack him, your song<br/>
pulses, guards attack you).<br/>
