&gt; PC problems last night caused me to loose my bookmarks.  I was able to find<br/>
&gt; most of my favorite EQ ones but two key URLs I couldn&#39;t find were John Kim&#39;s<br/>
&gt; page and Alacazam&#39;s (sp?  if I could spell it I could get there, right?).<br/>
&gt; If someone could post those I&#39;d be much obliged.<br/>
