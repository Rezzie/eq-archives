&gt; the name of<br/>
&gt; this song?  I&#39;ve been bugging it since I received it.  I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; sure they meant<br/>
&gt; it to be Cantata of Soothing, but someone misspelled it as <br/>
&gt; &quot;Cantana&quot;.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a minor point to be sure, but an annoying one nonetheless.<br/>
