<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046030914">On most servers, 500pp is way too much for a battle drum.  A fair price <br/>
would be somewhere around 200 to maybe 300pp.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;ve got a question for the higher level bards on the list.  Just how much<br/>
&gt;should a battle drum cost?  Based on the stats I&#39;ve seen I think I&#39;d be<br/>
&gt;willing to pay 500pp, but at the same time there&#39;s no need to get ripped<br/>
&gt;off. :)  What say ye, great bards? </span></blockquote></div>
