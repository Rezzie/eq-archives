<div id="ygrps-yiv-839268830">Well, if it is anything like the other on-line gaming communities i&#39;ve been<br/>
in lately. You will have to purchase the expansion set (usually 10-20$) to<br/>
continue to play the game. I certainally hope that they fix the obvious bugs<br/>
in the game before devoting the time and effort to a new expansion set. <br/>
<br/>
Meridian had upgrades every 4 months or so. This way they get an additional<br/>
boost in their cashflow to continue developing. I seriously doubt they will<br/>
have seperate servers, that would be too much of a hassle for them...[hears<br/>
them] Fixed bug A on server 1-10, but the fix didnt work on sever 11-20?<br/>
Nope, they will require us all to upgrade. That way their devel. team keeps<br/>
going in a straight line.</div>
