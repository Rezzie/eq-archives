<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062231909">While passing through N Karana the other day, I was given the opportunity of <br/>
looting a Griffene Charm off a slain Griffene.  I looted it, thanked the <br/>
Ogre that had supplied the kill, and sped off on my merry way.  Later, <br/>
however, I took a closer look at it.  It looks just like a Griffene charm, <br/>
is bard-only, +3 CHA.  But it&#39;s a Grinnene Charm, not a Griffene Charm!  Is <br/>
this a typo, something to trick the inattentive bard out of our hard-earned <br/>
money, or just something else?<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen this before?  I don&#39;t blame the Ogre for false advertising.. <br/>
First of all, he&#39;s an Ogre... heheeh, and secondly I didn&#39;t have to pay <br/>
anything for it...  But I&#39;d sure like to know if I&#39;m wasting precious bank <br/>
storage for just a piece of cheap jewelry... lol<br/>
