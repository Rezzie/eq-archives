<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097124326">The pet buff issue may be aimed at highger levels. <br/>
Some groups have been able to take down the big mobs,<br/>
i.e. nag and vox by giving pets a couple of combine<br/>
daggers, have the clerics buff them to heck, then let<br/>
them go at it.  I&#39;m not sure of this, but I have heard<br/>
from higher level players that this is a viable<br/>
tactic.  Don&#39;t know.<br/>
