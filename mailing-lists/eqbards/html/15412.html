&gt;Has anyone gone to the Temple of Solusek Ro since the latest patch to see if<br/>
&gt;the male bard NPC there says anything new in regards to the bard special<br/>
&gt;weapon quest?  If not I can check it out on Friday but would like to save<br/>
&gt;myself the time if someone can confirm that the quest has/hasn&#39;t been<br/>
&gt;implemented yet.<br/>

once in a while to check.  No luck so far.<br/>
