One thing that I would like added for bards, but I don&#39;t know if other&#39;s <br/>
would want it, is a button we could toggle between &#39;Group&#39; and &#39;All&#39;.  This <br/>
would then effect our songs to effect only those in our group, or those with<br/>
<br/>
in the song&#39;s radius around us. Many times sitting at a guard tower I wish I<br/>
<br/>
could play the Hymn to help the people around me heal faster. Or in the <br/>
newbie areas I&#39;d love to buff their stats, but can&#39;t group because I kill <br/>
their experience.  Any other thoughts on this idea?<br/>
