<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425594172">Quick question, what lev i need to be to get the nostrolo drum (my bard is<br/>
37)? or is it simpler to just go to kedge with a 52+ group and go find the<br/>
sharkskin drum? which of the 2 drums seems better (since i dont think i&#39;ll<br/>
ever get my hands on a selo&#39;s drum since the damn dragon patch)<br/>
<br/>
 Some guildmates were camping Phinigan for xp, kinda sad when his guards<br/>
wont even aggro when ya pull him... so i figure if they&#39;re going to kedge<br/>
for xp, i might as well hop along and hope to get a drum</div>
