<b>Subject:</b> Re: Dual wield vs using a shield (long) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-109975308">There&#39;s also something to be said for weight here. A shield weighs roughly<br/>
10 lbs for the small races, +2.5(dirk)-10(screaming mace) lbs for your<br/>
weapon. Presently I dual wield a combine long (7.5) and a dirk (2.5) for a<br/>
total of 10#. When you add in the weight of bronze plate, even for a small<br/>
race it adds up fast. With 3 backpacks, instruments, 10 food/water, full<br/>
bronze armor (minus the hideous helm for wood elves), and my weapons, I<br/>
weigh in at roughly 75#. So going INTO the dungeon I weigh that much. Thank<br/>
goodness for strength items and spells. since being overweight has an affect<br/>
on your agility (movement speed slows, greater percentage chance of being<br/>
stunned) you definitely want to watch your weight if you will be<br/>
fetching/pulling for your group.<br/>
