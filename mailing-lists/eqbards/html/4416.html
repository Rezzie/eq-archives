&gt; for one am going in there naked with a drum and a minotaur horn... scout<br/>
&gt; around a little!  Fear would be entered through Oasis I presume.  O how the<br/>
&gt; spectres will be running around the beach tomorrow I have a feeling!<br/>

Guarded by a pushover L40 Necromancer named Cyndreela...HUGE orange gate cant<br/>

PS. I wouldn&#39;t touch this plane with a 10 foot pole unless your in a full group<br/>
of 45+ The L62 DrachoLiche is quite intense ; )<br/>
