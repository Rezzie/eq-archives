<div id="ygrps-yiv-841064594">Stay in Rivervale and kill bixie drones and gobbie workers until you get a<br/>
few levels. (If money gets to be a problem, once you get Selo&#39;s at 5th, go<br/>
to Qeynos and do the mail run from Qeynos to Surefall.  It&#39;ll get you a<br/>
nicce bit of gold for your lvl)  You should be able to hang out in Misty<br/>
Thicket til you hit 14 or 15 (If I remember correctly).<br/>
