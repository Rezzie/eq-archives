<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353216618">many months ago, i was in a group in sol B of 4 total bards and 2 casters.<br/>
shortly after we all started playing mana song, the ENTIRE server was not<br/>
able to cast.  yes, that is right, 4+ bards in one group will remove ALL<br/>
mana from every caster on your server.  use with caution.<br/>
<br/>
Shada Bladestorm, L50 Wood Elf Bard<br/>
Tyria Sarkin, L30 High Elf Wizard<br/>
Manda D&#39;ulin, L22 Wood Elf Warrior<br/>
Mithaniel Marr Server<br/>
<br/>
p.s. i think i have seen that happen to my server 2 or 3 times, where no one<br/>
could cast without camping or zoning.  pretty funny coincidence that the<br/>
first time i saw it happen was just as we 4 bards got together in this one<br/>
group.  and yes the mana recovery was staggering.<br/>

&gt; Just for the fun of it, has anyone tried a 5 bard, 1 wizard <br/>
&gt; party (all the<br/>
&gt; bards singing clarity)?  It would be interesting to see just <br/>
&gt; how much mana<br/>
&gt; the wiz could cruise through.<br/>
