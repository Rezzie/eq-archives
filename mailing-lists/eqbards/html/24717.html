<div id="ygrps-yiv-297881760">I have always assumed that charmed pet xp stealing works the same as mage<br/>
pet xp stealing.  In which case, the pet takes 50% of the xp if he<br/>
outdamages the entire group.  That is highly unlikely.  However if that was<br/>
a concern you&#39;d merely let charm drop before the other mob dies...<br/>
<br/>
If they really wanted to improve charm, I wish they would put our charm cap<br/>
up to 55 or something.  Its annoying to lose one of our best abilities as we<br/>
reach the pinnacle of our career.  I am far from the forst person to say<br/>
that though...  Or at least give me back the old resist message (your target<br/>
is too high for this song or something) so I could learn which mobs were<br/>
charmable in high level dungeons...</div>
