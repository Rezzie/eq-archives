<div id="ygrps-yiv-759959508">My problem with Rolemaster is, its not high fantasy.  Heroes don&#39;t bleed to<br/>
death after being shot by an arrow from soem schlep goblin.  We ran into a<br/>
some hige warlord, mega evil NPC.  Whats our plan to kill him?  Launch a<br/>
small army of distempered  lizards into the castle, one of them will<br/>
critical him and kill him...<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I played Gemstone which was based on Rolemaster, its was a fun<br/>
Mudd, so the system has merit when you have a computer to crunch the<br/>
numbers.</div>
