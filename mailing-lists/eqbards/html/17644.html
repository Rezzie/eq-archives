<div id="ygrps-yiv-579363791">I have a new favorite mob in the game, new in poh: a haunted chest.<br/>
<br/>
  Looks like a big box with a lid that has big teeth.  When it attacks it<br/>
leaps at you, the lid opening and closing like its chomping, it sounds<br/>
like someone slamming a trunk lid shot.<br/>
<br/>
  The call of &quot;please do not taunt the luggage Tork&quot; had me laughing in RL<br/>
after I got chain summoned about 7x in a row. :)<br/>

PS: YES!  The footsteps thing is horrible!<br/>
