 </span></blockquote>I could be mistaken, but I don&#39;t think you can buff charmed pets.  Even if <br/>
you can - a LOT of the &quot;standard&quot; monster rules are suspended for the <br/>
monster class.  For example, you can&#39;t give them a weapon.  Like Atonal <br/>
pointed out, there&#39;s also a serious lack of &quot;survivability.&quot;  And <br/>
ultimately, if (god forbid) someone went to the great trouble to do this - <br/>
remember, it&#39;s a PVP okay server.  In other words, this falls under the <br/>
&quot;appropriate&quot; guidelines.<br/>
