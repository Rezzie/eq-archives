<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540681464">Someone on this list gave the Lute to Lord Grimlot, he said thanks and <br/>
equiped the Lute, then they killed him to get it back.  BTW what he wants is <br/>
Arelena&#39;s (sp?) Bones, NOT the Lute. I know this for a fact, as one of my <br/>
other characters (a Human Necromancer) got this quest from him.<br/>
