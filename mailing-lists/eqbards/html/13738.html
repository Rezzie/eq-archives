<br/>
Whilst no reason has been given for the patch done late last night, a number<br/>
of things have emerged from it.<br/>
Crippling Force is now in as a special for the Warrior class. It works like<br/>
critical hits and randomly goes off for what appears to be simply some bonus<br/>
damage (+25 at level 50).<br/>
Bards have had an animation fix and now sing while running instead of<br/>
gliding across the land while playing their instruments.<br/>
The SB Live fix went in, although it is apparently dependent on also having<br/>
the latest SB Live drivers.<br/>
