&gt; I refuse to buy ANY lambent stones on principle :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same here... ultimately it&#39;s just a matter of time before I&#39;m able to find<br/>
one myself (gotta love charm).  I&#39;d be willing to go as high as 25pp - just<br/>
to save myself some time.  Unfortunately, more often than not, the people<br/>
selling Lambent Stones (as noted previously, they generally tend to be<br/>
druids) are asking outrageous prices for an object they can&#39;t even use.<br/>
