get over 2K for them.  On the other hand with all the bard twinks running<br/>
around these days, there are probably plenty of bards with 50th level<br/>
characters who wouldn&#39;t mind at all dropping 3K on some MM drums so they can<br/>
run faster.  Heck, most of my best trades came from 50th level characters<br/>
twinking their other character :).<br/>
