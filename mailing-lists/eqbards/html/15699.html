&gt; see.  In fact a couple of guild officer&#39;s mule characters were left behind<br/>
&gt; with loads of runes, pages, gate potions, dragon loot, fbss&#39;s, ykeshas,<br/>
etc.<br/>
&gt; that he had stored..  yech.  So I&#39;ve got to say this wasn&#39;t for the<br/>
<br/>
I thought that they were moving all the players chars?? or was this a<br/>
separate account??? (that would be the only explanation I&#39;m thinking).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and enjoy!!<br/>
