<div id="ygrps-yiv-333522268">&quot;And enchanters have the exact same problem, with even LESS generic AC than<br/>
bards have. If something resists mez, then it comes straight for the<br/>
enchanter. (And if several things resist. Yikes! Dead enchanter.)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is a big difference here:<br/>
<br/>
Enchanter scenario:<br/>
Lots of mobs come.  Mobs jump whoever is closest until Enchanter AE Mez/Stun<br/>
fires off.  Enchanters can be resisted, but the Enchanter resist rate is FAR<br/>
less than a bard resist rate; perhaps when they get around to fixing Lullaby<br/>
and Pixie, that&#39;ll change.  I very rarely have to charm anything off of the<br/>
enchantress I play with (I charm very quickly when I see her getting<br/>
tagged).  Enchanters also have a relatively quick-casting Stun line that<br/>
allows them time to reapply the mez for those resisting.<br/>
<br/>
Bard scenario:<br/>
Lots of mobs come.  Mobs jump whoever is closest until the bard&#39;s next song<br/>
pulses (anywhere from 0.01 seconds to 3.00 seconds, depending on where in<br/>
the twist the bard is).  Then all extra mobs proceed to gank the bard.<br/>
Sometimes, it does take a couple pulses.<br/>
