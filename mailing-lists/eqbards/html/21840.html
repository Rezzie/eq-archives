&gt; I do remember reading stories of bards in Blackburrow mezzing 30+ mobs at a <br/>

bard tried it were too much. Also, remember that this was at the top of<br/>
blackburrow, and 90% of the crowd of gnolls mezzed at the time were<br/>
green to the 2 bards, and they still woke up occasionally and took a<br/>
poke at the bards.<br/>

Wish I could find my old screenshot of it, it was 2 friends of mine I<br/>
played with on Fennin Ro back in Beta 4, and it made screenshot of the<br/>
day just after beta closed.<br/>
