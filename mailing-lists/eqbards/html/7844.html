misremembering, or they changed it.  Drowning damage ticks<br/>
every second, and does 1/8th your hp - i.e. you&#39;re dead in 8<br/>
seconds.  I was hit by a brief lag bubble when it started and<br/>
almost died in roughly a half foot of water.  My hp bar didn&#39;t<br/>
even refresh until after I surfaced.<br/>
