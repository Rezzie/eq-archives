<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827846174">I wanted to answer this, and quote things from the message<br/>
  but I haven&#39;t the energy.  I&#39;ll tell you this much:<br/>
<br/>
  I made level 50 after 9 months, Verant suggested it would take 12<br/>
  months to make level 50.  I guess I&#39;m smarter than the average <br/>
  bard.  But clumping me in the powergamers cliq is your own false<br/>
  take on this.  If you&#39;re looking for someone to blame, don&#39;t look<br/>
  this way.<br/>
 <br/>
  All I can tell you right now is your tune will change.  Mine did.<br/>
