<div id="ygrps-yiv-647196540">A number of people have stated there is a four target limit for the area<br/>
effect songs now.  Last night I was at the monolith with the undead in North<br/>
Karana and had 5 zombies and a skeleton all sleeping like babies while I<br/>
attacked a 6th zombie with Kelin&#39;s Lucid Lullaby.  Maybe it has to do with<br/>
some kind of level differential or something?<br/>
