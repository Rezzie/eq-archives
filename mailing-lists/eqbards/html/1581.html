<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816261707">I&#39;ve got some time and money to waste so I thought I&#39;d try and investigate <br/>
what to do with these instrument parts some vendors have on them. Before I <br/>
do so though, I have no clue where I could go about &quot;combining&quot; them. I <br/>
doubt forges or ovens will do the trick, any suggestions what I could check <br/>
out? I&#39;ll ask some Gnome types how tinkering works - if it does at all.<br/>
