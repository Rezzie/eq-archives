<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417050407">Mino horns are wind instruments.  As soon as you get the water breathing <br/>
song, any time you&#39;re standing around doing nothing, equip the horn and <br/>
play the song.  That will get your skill up, so you&#39;ll be well practiced <br/>
when you get the invisibility song (which is where it&#39;s important).<br/>
