&gt;Sound: Soundblaster live (First version on the market)<br/>
&gt;Graphics: ASUS 6800 (GeForce 1 with 32MB DDR RAM)<br/>

&gt;Only annoying problem I have is loading time from server select screen to<br/>

&gt;I zone reasonbly fast when ingame, compared to others. But just to try and<br/>
&gt;get my zoning to go faster I recently expanded my RAM to 256 (from 128) but<br/>
&gt;did not notice any improvement on anything. Well I kinda expected that, but<br/>
&gt;SDRAM is so cheap these days that I just had to try.<br/>
&gt;I figure that my HD is due for an upgrade next(got a lousy UDMA33 4GB disk).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As to video lag I do not have any. My GeForce performs flawlessly at<br/>
&gt;1024x768 only times I note a slight slowdown is when ALOT casting is going<br/>
&gt;on.<br/>

I have disabled the &quot;obvious&quot; part of their software (I have SBLive) but <br/>
apparently, it&#39;s still running things in the background via the internet. :-P</div>
