&gt; I know this is way old (going thru old email) but 28 is not even close to<br/>
&gt; strong enough to get your own drum, unless you&#39;re extremelly lucky.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I ended up buying a chipped bone bracelet for 500 pp and trading that for<br/>
&gt; the MM Drums.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; well (and we bards are the brightest bunch).  At 28th I think that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; approaching the level that I would expect to be able to get a MM<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Battle Drum<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with my own group.  Is this correct?<br/>
