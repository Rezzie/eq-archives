<div id="ygrps-yiv-57834307">I played around with Psalm of Cooling (L33) briefly in<br/>
Runnyeye last night and immediately noticed that it also<br/>
grants ultravision.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I had to put it away as it was just me and a<br/>
paladin exploring deep inside Runnyeye and I needed every song<br/>
slot.  I didn&#39;t get to use it in combat.  Has anyone used this<br/>
song extensively?<br/>
