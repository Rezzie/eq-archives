<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061031794">I hope this doesn&#39;t sound stupid, but what good is the Mino Horn?  Does it<br/>
work with brass songs, or wind songs?  What kind of brass instruments are<br/>
there?  I haven&#39;t seen any animations done with it during the lvl 18 dd<br/>
song, so I assume it&#39;s not working with brass...<br/>
