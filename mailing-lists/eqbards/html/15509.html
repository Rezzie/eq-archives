I was disappointed with the armor drop rate though.  We had<br/>
about 35 people there, and got 5 armor drops for the<br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
(35 people) * (11 hours/person) / 5 pieces =<br/>
= 77 hours per piece<br/>
= 7 hate trips per piece<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m *not* looking forward to 42 Hate trips to get all the<br/>
pieces of imbrued.<br/>
