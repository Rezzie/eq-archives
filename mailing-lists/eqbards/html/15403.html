<div id="ygrps-yiv-1394511013">Has anyone gone to the Temple of Solusek Ro since the latest patch to see if<br/>
the male bard NPC there says anything new in regards to the bard special<br/>
weapon quest?  If not I can check it out on Friday but would like to save<br/>
myself the time if someone can confirm that the quest has/hasn&#39;t been<br/>
implemented yet.<br/>
