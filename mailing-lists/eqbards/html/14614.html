<div id="ygrps-yiv-314223377">Thanks, you stated it much better than I did :).  I actually fear that<br/>
dragons will be raised 25 levels (assuming kunark raises the max lvl by<br/>
25)  Making them still kind of the &quot;big guys&quot; in the game.  Same thing<br/>
for the gods.<br/>
<br/>
In either case people like me will never, e-e-e-e-ever kill a dragon.<br/>
