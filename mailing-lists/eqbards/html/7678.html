<div id="ygrps-yiv-30568844">one other thing to add, is that using this song the same level you get it<br/>
(15) will be less effective than a couple levels later.  so don&#39;t give up on<br/>
it.  once you gain a few levels it will most likely save you and your<br/>
group&#39;s life more often than getting you killed.<br/>
