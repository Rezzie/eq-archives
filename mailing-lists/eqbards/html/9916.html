<div id="ygrps-yiv-508993920">An appearance question for all you steel plate wearing wood-elf males out<br/>
there.  What color is your steel plate tinged with?  I am wearing the shin<br/>
greaves, which I thought would look just like plate, but I have never seen<br/>
anyone else with legs that are this color.  They appear to be a rose tinged<br/>
silvery hue on me and ever since I put them on I constantly get &quot;XXXXXX is<br/>
examining your equipment&quot; or whatever that message is.  The wood elf females<br/>
I have seen in what looked like steel plate were blue tinged.  Is this the<br/>
normal appearance of steel plate on wood elves?  If the rose color is normal<br/>
then I guess I have never seen any wood elves in steel plate on E&#39;ci.<br/>
