<div id="ygrps-yiv-259408929">Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I must say first of all, that I&#39;m only level 11.  I managed to come into a<br/>
lambent stone by trading a wooden totem for it, in North Karana.  Now that I<br/>
have one, is there any chance at all I can get a piece of lambent armor, or<br/>
do I just get to stick it in the bank until later levels?</div>
