<div id="ygrps-yiv-912063584">A friend of mine handed this to me, said it was off some rare NPC in North<br/>
Karana.  I remembered once hearing someone in the Qeynos guild asking for<br/>
some strong trollgut to fashion strings, but I can&#39;t find the person who<br/>
asked anymore.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can pass on information regarding to finishing this quest, I&#39;ll<br/>
happily let everyone know when I&#39;m rewarded with a rusty short sword.<br/>
