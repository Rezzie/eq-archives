&gt;Nice. Was there a reason the following were omitted or did I just miss it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;/cast #<br/>
&gt;/sit (on/off)<br/>
&gt;/pause<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, it would be nice if they were separated into different sections by<br/>
&gt;type, but heck, it&#39;s a great list anyway!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I actually had those in the &quot;buffer&quot; waiting to be added - but I haven&#39;t <br/>
made changes since September.  I&#39;m working on it now, though - so by the <br/>
end of the day, they should be accurate. In fact, if you ever find an error <br/>
or a new command, please don&#39;t hesitate to email<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
You know - I really have no clue why I keep maintaining this stuff - I did <br/>
quit EQ after all ;)<br/>
