<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828197722">I have very little trouble keeping 2 mobs mezzed with pixie strike. Using a<br/>
mino horn (Save up for one of these babies!!!!) and with 135 unbuffed cha<br/>
(nothing special) I was keeping 2 mobs mezzed in chardok (where the mobs are<br/>
high blue/yellow to me, if a mob was red to me, we were probably killing it<br/>
first).<br/>

So Pixie is reliable enough to keep 2 mobs mezzed.</div>
