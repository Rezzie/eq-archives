<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366707244">I just got my Mask of Deception (yeah yeah I know..I should have had this<br/>
thing 15 levels ago) and the evil Dragoons in The Overthere still are<br/>
scowling ready to attack when I am a Delf.<br/>
<br/>
I am a half-elf Bard, Quellious is my Diety.  Is there any way to use the<br/>
Charismatic Carrilion (sp?) to up faction enough to turn in the braids for<br/>
faction increases?<br/>
