&gt;Am I interpreting his last statement correctly? The way I read it, casters<br/>
&gt;being able to bind in a dungeon zone is a bug.  That would seem to indicate<br/>
&gt;that Verant&#39;s original intent was that casters could only bind in<br/>
&gt;cities and outdoor zones.  I&#39;ve never heard that discussed anywhere before<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;that lead to my confusion on his statement.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds right.<br/>
I started playing/exploring the Internet in April. At THAT point, some zones<br/>
were labeled as dungeons and a note was there that you could not bind there.<br/>
I guess it never pinged on me &quot;duh. That&#39;s what casters are doing on those<br/>
Vox raids, etc&quot; since I have never gotten high enough to really do a lot in<br/>
dungeons (I&#39;m somewhat afraid of them) For myself, those of my characters<br/>
that can bind do NOT do it in a dungeon. They do it near a zoneline that<br/>
does not get a lot of<br/>
trains (and usually up a wall somewhere)<br/>
