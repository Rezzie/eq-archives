<div id="ygrps-yiv-329793472">Has anyone figured out what this song does?  I went to the Arena with<br/>
a friend to test it out, and near as I could tell, it did nothing.<br/>
Someone at one time suggested that maybe it reduced the duration of<br/>
harmful DoTs, but her Creeping Crud did full damage to me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
