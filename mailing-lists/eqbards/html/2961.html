<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937646655">I&#39;ve just sub&#39;d to the list and wanted to introduce myself.  I&#39;m having a<br/>
blast playing a Bard and consider this a fine class for someone who wants a<br/>
bit of everything ;)<br/>
<br/>
	One Question I have is I&#39;ve seen a Battle Drum mentioned on this<br/>
list...I&#39;ve never heard anyone speak of this instrument..is it made?<br/>
dropped? what?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
