<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-591083640">Heya all, this weekend I blew through 26, 27 and most of 28, thus I&#39;ve<br/>
added two big songs to my arsenal, Charm and Pixie Strike...<br/>
<br/>
Pixie Strike uses are obvious, and I&#39;m already getting good at timing<br/>
the mob&#39;s castings...<br/>
<br/>
Charm is a little trickier, I have experimented with several techniques<br/>
of using the song.  Is there a good reference somewhere on charm<br/>
techniques?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)<br/>
