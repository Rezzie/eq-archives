<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041272771">You&#39;re right Adon.  The things my friend saw when he told his guild were<br/>
even worse.  Many casters begged him to stay while the melee and hybrids all<br/>
told him they understood his frustration.  It nearly killed the guild once<br/>
it was realized the only reason the casters really wanted him to stay was<br/>
manasong.  There was talk for a while of breaking up the whole guild<br/>
basically since all the non-casters threatened to quit.  They already felt<br/>
like they were treated as second class citizens anyhow since they were<br/>
outnumbered.<br/>
