<div id="ygrps-yiv-541452871">I know this is off topic and not related (as far as I know) to Bards<br/>
specifically, but there are some very knowledgeable people on this list and<br/>
I haven&#39;t found the answer elsewhere..<br/>
<br/>
I have looted a blurred map. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s for some quest, I&#39;ve even heard<br/>
rumors that it has something to do with someone in Qeynos that&#39;s building a<br/>
&quot;titanic bridge&quot; from Qeynos to Erudin. I&#39;ve also heard rumors that the<br/>
quest actually isn&#39;t working right now. <br/>
<br/>
Could anyone give a spoiler as to what to do with this map? (It&#39;s a Lore<br/>
Item) Even a pointer of where to go or something would be appreciated..<br/>
<br/>
Happy journeys and in tune songs..</div>
