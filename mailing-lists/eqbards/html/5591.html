Shaman for example.. The wizard casts root on the mob<br/>
and then the Shaman poisons it. Darn, sorry - you&#39;re<br/>
not close enough to the monster, your DoT isn&#39;t going<br/>
to work?<br/>
<br/>
How *#*$ stupid can they get?<br/>
<br/>
The whole point of a DoT is to poison something. If we<br/>
as players chase a mob that poisoned us, does OUR<br/>
poison stop? I bet I can tell you the answer to that<br/>
one rather quickly. Poison is poison. It&#39;s in the body,<br/>
it doesn&#39;t go away just because you have to chase<br/>
something. I don&#39;t normally kite (how boring) but I&#39;m<br/>
totally against them changing the spells this drastically<br/>
for everyone just because some people do.</div>
