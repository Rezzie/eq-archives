<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1000686362">True.  Of course the simpliest way to avoid faction hits in PoG is to NOT<br/>
HUNT THERE :)  As Rokenn follows Tunare he certainly will not be, and shame<br/>
on you wood elves that go there to kill your godess&#39; creations.  What are<br/>
you Teir&#39;dal or something? haha<br/>
<br/>
- KILL em all now :) Let em sort it out later.<br/>
<br/>
Tho Tunare may be my creator she is NOT my god.  I follow Quellious :)   I<br/>
blame it ALL on the quest for knowledge.  I WANT to know what Tunare looks<br/>
like dead.  I want to know what Phat Lewtz she drops :)<br/>
<br/>
God! I am evil &gt;:)<br/>
<br/>
Besides :) so you get Kos in parts of Kelethin and Felwith.  More zones to<br/>
hunt in!<br/>
<br/>
Give me enough time and I can justify all my actions!<br/>
