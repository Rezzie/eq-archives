<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780919760">Speaking of all the new velious armors I am kind of confused maybe someone<br/>
can shed some light on this....<br/>
 <br/>
Is it not true that all the velious armor has basically the same stats but<br/>
are arrived at through different avenues depending on what factions you want<br/>
to destroy?<br/>
 <br/>
i.e. Melodic = Resonant = Troubador ?<br/>

-Faras<br/>
