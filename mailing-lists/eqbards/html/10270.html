<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; But even when I am awake, dungeons and me simply get me all <br/>
&gt; mixed up. I get<br/>
&gt; lost really easy.  My group gets real sick of leading me and <br/>
&gt; out all the<br/>
&gt; time.  Run to the zone?  You got to be kidding! Of course, it <br/>
&gt; dont help when<br/>
&gt; the route you take in is different from the route to run out <br/>
&gt; and you never<br/>
&gt; practice the run out (which I do now - when they take me <br/>
&gt; somewhere new) </span></blockquote></div>
