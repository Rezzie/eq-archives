<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767998692">I think that a lot are still blue at level 59.  I know at least 3 people<br/>
who have levelled to 60 off them.  It may be green experience at 59, but<br/>
they all quad-kited their way to 60.<br/>

Not sure on the lvl but I know he told me that my enchanter and his<br/>
warrior<br/>
were still getting exp from the mobs at 56 and 58 respectively.   From<br/>
what<br/>
I understand its a good exp place for a group around 51 to mid 50&#39;s or a<br/>
bit<br/>
higher.  Jeff?<br/>
