&lt;snip story about SoW overriding Accelerando&gt;<br/>

&gt;that Accelerando used to override SoW, not the other way around (you would <br/>
&gt;still have the SoW icon, but you&#39;d run at Accelerando speed and get the <br/>
&gt;&quot;Your feet move faster&quot; message).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I hate to say it, and I know there&#39;s gonna be a bunch more deaths as<br/>
a result of this, but I&#39;m glad they implemented this change.  Sure, it<br/>
nerfs our ability to help our teammates - but these are the same teammates<br/>
who were upset that we were overriding their SoW before during emergency<br/>
peelouts.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I&#39;m not really happy about it - but I have a feeling it&#39;s a<br/>
nerf-to-stay.<br/>
