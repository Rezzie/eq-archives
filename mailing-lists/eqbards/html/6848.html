<br/>
I just last night attained the 19th song. And a useful song it is!  I need<br/>
to know where I may<br/>
journey to further my pursuits. I have heard of a place called Lake Rathe<br/>
or something but what<br/>
sort&#39;s of beast dwell within?  I have been raging a war against the Gnoll<br/>
Reavers in Eastern karana.<br/>
But it seems a losing battle as they reappear at night in a ghostly form<br/>
only to be killed again!<br/>
