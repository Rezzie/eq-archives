<div id="ygrps-yiv-446965378">I think my general point was missed.  The only situation I can think of<br/>
where the damage shield songs are a better choice than our other songs is<br/>
when facing a mob that is immune to magic, like the EXG in Sol A.  As far as<br/>
I have found these songs never outdamage other songs that are available at<br/>
the level we get them.  Does anyone have good success with these songs?  If<br/>
they did better damage they might be a viable option, but as they are I just<br/>
don&#39;t see it.<br/>
