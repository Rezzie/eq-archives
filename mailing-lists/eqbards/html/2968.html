The spectres normally stay on the island.  If they were<br/>
sweeping the coast, it&#39;s because some higher level players<br/>
foolishly/inconsiderately tried to attack them, and instead of<br/>
gracefully dying when they realized they were outmatched, ran<br/>
for the zone with spectres in tow, thus unleashing them on<br/>
everyone else.</div>
