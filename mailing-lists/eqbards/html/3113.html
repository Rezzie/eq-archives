<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;EverQuest has the most frustrating, baroque, complicated, step-filled,<br/>
&gt;ugly, memoryless way in and out of it that I&#39;ve had the displeasure of<br/>
&gt;using.  It clacks back and forth between screen resolutions, forces me to<br/>
&gt;interact in repetative, silly ways, takes way too long timing out on link<br/>
&gt;failures, and doesn&#39;t give me options for hurrying it along, such as a way<br/>
&gt;to break out of the timer when I&#39;m sure my link is dead.  It even gives me<br/>
&gt;a frustrating peek at my screen, showing me that the link has failed, then<br/>
&gt;goes through attempts and timeouts trying to get back to the login server<br/>
&gt;when it&#39;s completely hopeless, so I can click in three (!) different places<br/>
&gt;to make it go away and reconnect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Some things about EverQuest are outstanding.  Some are abysmal.  Obviously<br/>
&gt;the plusses outweigh the minusses for me, but oh, what it could be with<br/>
&gt;some of the easier minusses fixed....<br/>
