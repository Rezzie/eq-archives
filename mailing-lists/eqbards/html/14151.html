<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936630940">Do you use Psalm of Warmth? A tank told me last week he hates when bards<br/>
use this, because it kills Ultravision, whether it be the spell or the<br/>
guise effect (he is a 50 warrior with a guise of the deceiver). I forgot<br/>
to check this, and he wasn&#39;t 100% sure which song it was. He simply said<br/>
&quot;the song that puts up the wimpy damage shield that&#39;s a cold resist<br/>
buff&quot; ;P. I&#39;ve noted a large number of bards like to play this song for<br/>
the damage shield in the L30s range. Perhaps if you are doihng so, this<br/>
is the cause of your problem.<br/>
