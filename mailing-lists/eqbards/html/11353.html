&gt; &gt; PS - You Innoruuk Bards with the Platinum Ruby Veils and the Golden Black<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pearl Chokers (you know who you are, Sylly and Harmonic) - who makes<br/>
&gt; &gt; them?  How much should I expect to pay?  Where do I go to find a Black<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pearl?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Nadare, Smith, Circe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Veil runs around 1k pp.<br/>
&gt;   Choker runs around 300 pp.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Black pearls seem to drop from aviak avocets most frequently.<br/>
&gt;   However I have got them from griffons and hill giants on the<br/>
&gt;   most rare occassion.<br/>
