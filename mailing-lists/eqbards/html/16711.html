<div id="ygrps-yiv-509518164">i know you have argued this for a long long time Kit, but i must say<br/>
something.  do you know how absolutely vital, critical, and in all ways a<br/>
MUST melee classes are at high levels?  nothing in the high level game can<br/>
be done without a lot of melee characters in your group or groups.  so what<br/>
is the definition of balance then?  ability to solo, or necessity to a<br/>
grooup, raid, or event?  melee classes are not only invaluable but a total<br/>
necessity at high levels, so could your argument follow at low to mid levels<br/>
and then reverse itself at high levels?  just an alternate scenario to<br/>
ponder and discuss.<br/>
