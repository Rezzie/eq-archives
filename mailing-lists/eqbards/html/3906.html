&gt;    Thanks for that info! I was able to get a Bracer by soloing the camp (one<br/>
&gt; member at a time) and totally avoiding Gronit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   BUT... I found this thing called &quot;Pirate earring&quot;, which is ALSO a LORE<br/>
&gt; item. Anyone know what it&#39;s for?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
