<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684735793">Well, I purchased a MM drum yesterday, for the low price of 250pp + a<br/>
LizardScale Cloak, negotiated down to that from 500pp, mainly I think,<br/>
because a group was selling it and wanted a quick return.<br/>
<br/>
After getting it I was quite disappointed. I didn&#39;t seem to run that<br/>
much faster, and I couldn&#39;t find a percussion song that had a<br/>
quantifiable effect increase. Is this due to the recent patch issue that<br/>
affected MM drum and selo&#39;s? Or can someone reccommend a song I can play<br/>
to see the difference?<br/>
