<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695617172">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Sorry if this has been hashed over before, but I&#39;m wondering if anyone<br/>
could share their experiences or knowledge on what effect charisma has on<br/>
bard songs. I&#39;ve left my charisma at base (85) when I created my<br/>
character, however now that star rubies are purchasable, I have an<br/>
opportunity to get +7 dex +5 charisma rings. I know the dex will<br/>
definitely be useful, but does the charisma have any effect besides<br/>
buying/selling? Perhaps less resists? Longer charms?<br/>
<br/>
I know a lot of the info on charisma is probably just speculation since<br/>
it&#39;s so hard to measure, but I&#39;m still curious to hear what people have to<br/>
say on it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
