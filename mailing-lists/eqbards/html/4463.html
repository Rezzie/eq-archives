&gt; &gt;I have hand-to-hand up to 100 now (is it capped?  I hope not!).  The most I<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; hrm, i was pretty sure mine capped out at 60, but it might be 100.<br/>
&gt; Regardless its not more than 100 im sure. To check a cap go to the trainer<br/>
&gt; and try to train some more points into the skill. <br/>

levels though.<br/>
