<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043813785">I&#39;ve seen people mention they have songs on the quick buttons.  I&#39;m wondering what the advantages of this over using the standards spell slots along the top side of the screen.  Is it just personal preference - or is there in fact an advantage?  Maybe its just habits.  I didn&#39;t know about the quick-keys doing anything but holding &quot;abilities&quot; until about level 8 and got used to clicking songs in the above slots...<br/>
