<div id="ygrps-yiv-320925427"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; OK the reason may be obvious but have gone right over my head, but why do<br/>
&gt; you do a /who sylly on yourself?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  actually, I just do:<br/>
<br/>
  /who friends all<br/>
<br/>
  but then I&#39;d have to explain that Sylly is on my friends list.<br/>
  So I cut it short and typed:  /who sylly (implied all)<br/>
<br/>
  I just checked to see which friends were online by doing that.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic, the people person.</div>
