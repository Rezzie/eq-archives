<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236078332">This is a good list of bard related things to fix, and since John&#39;s list is<br/>
almost entirely what I would consider bugs, I would have no problem signing it.<br/>
<br/>
If I could add one thing:  raise the skill cap on Instill Doubt and/or make it<br/>
so it is not dependent on landing a kick in order to work.  I have personally<br/>
pressed the Instill Doubt button THOUSANDS of times, and never gained a point or<br/>
scared anyone.  If we&#39;re going to have a skill, at least make it work.<br/>
