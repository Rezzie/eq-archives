<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1238070343">Ok, I&#39;ve been 40 for about a month now, and have 2 bubbles to go.  I&#39;m sick<br/>
of being 40!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also sick of pickup groups!  Heh.  So, any advice would be welcome on<br/>
where to go at this level, and what song combination to use to solo me 2<br/>
bubbles as quickly as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been using chains-fulfils-tuyens, but it takes so long to kill a frost<br/>
giant this way...I get bored quickly (hence, 40 for a month...hehe).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
