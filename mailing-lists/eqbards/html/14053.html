<div id="ygrps-yiv-24427186"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; how much mana does it use for you?  i usually go down to 1.5 bubbs left.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  yeah I go down close to that.  It&#39;s very close to 1.5 bubs.<br/>
  The thing is as soon as I fill up almost 4ish bubbles I tend to just<br/>
  use it then and then I go down to 0 mana.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; get back to 3.5 bubbs is more like 30 min if i sit often enough, and i would<br/>
&gt; say 45 min to get back to full.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  It&#39;s definitely longer than an hour for me.  I never sit down.<br/>
  I should take my &#39;Sit&#39; hotkey and delete it.  Because the only time<br/>
  I sit down is when I camp.  It also appears that meditate moves the<br/>
  bar somewhat faster too, I went away from keyboard for 10 mins while<br/>
  medding and got a bub and a half back.  But who knows ;-)<br/>
