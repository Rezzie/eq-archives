<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565659916">Was wondering what happens if you are fighting a spellcasting mob and sing<br/>
the teleport song?  For example, an ogre shaman is standing in front of you<br/>
and starts casting a spell.  As soon as you see the text message that he has<br/>
started casting the spell, you start singing the teleport song and<br/>
successfully teleport before he finishes casting the spell.  The teleport<br/>
could move you behind the shaman (no longer in his line of sight) or move<br/>
you further away out of the range of the spell.  Would you still get<br/>
affected by the spell?  If not, would the shaman lose the mana?<br/>
