<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342384322">I know with the patch and what not (*cough* nerf) to feign death its no<br/>
longer the be all end all pulling method... but could someone explain what<br/>
was involved in pulling just one mob (the Maestro past 15 others was<br/>
mentioned once)?<br/>
<br/>
Email is fine so the list isn&#39;t spammed but lately I&#39;ve been getting the nod<br/>
to pull from Mistmoore, which fine by me - I have some great no-mana-cost<br/>
tools available to me, but that place obviously involves technique.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
