<div id="ygrps-yiv-1012051717">Haven&#39;t really used this song much on the past.  The few times I did use it,<br/>
I never noticed a successmessage that the song stuck or a resist message.<br/>
The other night in Dreadlands a monk and I were partnered up so I memmed<br/>
this song in case we pulled a spider.  So first time I used it, I got the<br/>
message &quot;mob is surrounded by a static pulse of energy&quot; or something else<br/>
along those lines.  So now it appears we get a success message when the song<br/>
sticks.<br/>
