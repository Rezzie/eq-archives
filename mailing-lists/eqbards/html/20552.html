Last week I joined a pickup group in Dalnirs.  We did<br/>
pretty well in the Temple room so somebody suggested<br/>
we go down to lvl 2.  As we all landed in the pool of<br/>
water, sombody got excited and pulled a nice train<br/>
into the room before we got set up.  THings got bad<br/>
and somebody said gate -- The monk and I were left to<br/>
die.  Funny thing, all four casters in the group had<br/>
to log at that point ... <br/>
7 deaths (6 during corpse recovery) at lvl 30 sure can<br/>
ruin your night. sigh<br/>
