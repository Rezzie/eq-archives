<div id="ygrps-yiv-91200226">The advantage is in twisting.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of moving the mouse and clicking - esp hard during some mage<br/>
spells due to screen saturation.<br/>
<br/>
You just hit a number key -<br/>
when I twist I have say - Antham on #3 Bellow #5 and protection #2<br/>
it goes something like this<br/>
hit 3 - wait for 5 secs - see the blue text<br/>
hit 5 hit 5 - wait 5 secs - see the blue text<br/>
hit 2 hit 2 - wait 5 secs - see the blue text<br/>
hit 3 hit 3 ....<br/>
<br/>
You get the timing down after only a couple battles, you stop even<br/>
having to see the text saying your song is in effect. --- WAY better<br/>
than mouse clicking.<br/>

&gt; until about level 8 and got used to clicking songs<br/>
