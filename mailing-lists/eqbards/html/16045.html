That combination is impossible if dual wield were based on<br/>
your primary weapon speed.<br/>

Besides, it&#39;d be really really stupid if Verant coded it based<br/>
on primary weapon.  If that were so, you could put a mithril<br/>
quill (4/16) in your primary and a glowing pike (9/36) in your<br/>
secondary, and your secondary would act like a 9/16 weapon.<br/>
