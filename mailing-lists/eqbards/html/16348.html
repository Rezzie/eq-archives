<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917377177">Yes...and I pointed out that Chains has that advantage when twisted in<br/>
combat. But I think that the original post focused on the effectiveness of<br/>
Chains versus Snare/Root for purposes of preventing a mob from escaping in a<br/>
dungeon where said mob might pull a train back. Obviously, the attack speed<br/>
of an escaping mob isn&#39;t much of a concern, so I compared Chains to<br/>
Snare/Root purely on a &quot;mob-stopping&quot; basis.<br/>

&gt; Actually, if the bard knows what they&#39;re doing, chains is BETTER<br/>
&gt; Than snare. Snare doesn&#39;t have a 30% attack speed de-buff. </span></blockquote></div>
