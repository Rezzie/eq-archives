<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011174153">I dont know if I was replying to you or someone else, but they made it<br/>
sound like Infra was barely better than human vision.  Thats pretty far<br/>
off.  If you have a Greater light stone and some flashing song,<br/>
obviously that helps the human vision...  Actually the darkest place I<br/>
know is the tunnel into Guk in Innothule, though I never went into the<br/>
arena tunnel with a human...  In the guk tunnel I turned my brightness<br/>
all the way up on my monitor and still could only see people&#39;s names. <br/>
Needless to say the troll there had a pretty fun time, guiding me to the<br/>
guk zone.  (&quot;Turn lef! lef!&quot;  &quot;No rit! rit!&quot;)<br/>
