nice &quot;you have missed a note...&quot; failures that happened three<br/>
times in a row).  It didn&#39;t make a difference - I still didn&#39;t<br/>
interrupt a single casting lizard.<br/>

If they really made it tougher to interrupt casters, I despise<br/>
this change, and not because it weakens one of our abilities.  <br/>
Casting classes already had it easy enough versus melee<br/>
classes.  This just makes it even easier for casters (who can<br/>
kill casting mobs quicker and thus don&#39;t have to withstand as<br/>
many spells).  I&#39;m really starting to feel like a second rate<br/>
citizen as a melee class.<br/>
