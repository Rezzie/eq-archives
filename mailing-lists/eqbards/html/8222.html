<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437296986"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; lightstone or not. (It used to be that you could run around <br/>
&gt; killing ONLY the wisps that gave off light, and would be<br/>
&gt; assured of a lightstone each time. Now you must kill em all<br/>
&gt; and taken your chances.)<br/>

why Burned Out Lightstones are NO DROP I&#39;d be a bit happier.<br/>
The normal and greater lightstones aren&#39;t NO DROP, so why<br/>
the useless burned out ones?</div>
