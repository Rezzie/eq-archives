<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610646460">Whoever has a good list of all or most of the songs and what they do,<br/>
please submit this info to the ultimate EQ info site, EQLizer. Their bard<br/>
song list is pathetic, and I know they would value the info. Just e-mail<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jcsmith@...">jcsmith@...</a> with the info . . .<br/>
<br/>
	And perhaps another reminder about where such a list can be found we be<br/>
good for all of us.<br/>
