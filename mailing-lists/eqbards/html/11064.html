<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040967313">Yeah, pretty simple.  Make it so casting levitate doesn&#39;t raise you in<br/>
height by a set amount like it does now, but instead casting it raises you<br/>
to a set height above the terrain you are standing on.  Obviously they<br/>
already do this or you couldn&#39;t &#39;pop&#39; over things that are slightly higher<br/>
than you.<br/>

So whats the solution to all this common nonsense?  Make it so when you<br/>
recast levitate, you don&#39;t raise in height.   There, not too hard...now, if<br/>
only verant cared...</div>
