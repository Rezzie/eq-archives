<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129858848">I was looking for a trainer in Firiona yesterday.  I think I found one for<br/>
almost every class except Bards naturally.  <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if there was one and I missed it?  I found the Bard<br/>
spellsong merchant.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if I found a cleric trainer either, but I definitely found one<br/>
for all the &#39;good&#39; INT casters, ranger, rogue, shaman, and paladin.<br/>
