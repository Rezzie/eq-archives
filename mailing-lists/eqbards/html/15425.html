<div id="ygrps-yiv-412725167">I think we can all agree that the code in EQ is very good.  The problem is the lack of attention to detail as to what new changes will cause:<br/>
<br/>
For example, the code to &quot;fix&quot; levitation was fantastic.  It went in quickly and it had no bugs.  However, nobody had considered the effect it would have on classes that have to constantly refresh the spell (Bards)<br/>
<br/>
The code to &quot;Fix&quot; Charm broke the level 27 charm song for bards.  The code itself is flawless but it &#39;broke&#39; another aspect of the game due to lack of forethought and lack of testing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t fault the programmers<br/>
I fault those who are tasked with a) Designing, b) Testing and c) Troubleshooting<br/>
<br/>
90% of the &quot;Bugs&quot; in this game are caused by patches thrown into place without thorough testing.<br/>
