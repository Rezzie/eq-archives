<div id="ygrps-yiv-932428328">I picked up a Staff of Writhing a couple of days ago, so I&#39;ve been working <br/>
on 1H Blunt skill.  When I first started using it with no skill, skill went <br/>
up by like 5 points in an hour or two.  When I got back to Freeport, <br/>
though, I dumped 30 training points into the skill.  After that it&#39;s been <br/>
going up steadily -- I&#39;m up to 80-something now.  I just switched my other <br/>
hand from tomahawk to a Dvinn dagger, putting another 30 training points <br/>
into piercing, to train that skill; I&#39;ll see whether that goes up equally <br/>
well.  (And I still have 40 training points unspent.  Bards don&#39;t really <br/>
have anything to spend them on at high levels, unless we want to learn <br/>
languages for no particular reason.)<br/>
