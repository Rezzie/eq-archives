<b>Subject:</b> Change in fleeing in patch? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914459809">Did anyone else note a change in the fleeing over the last couple of nights<br/>
since the patch?  I had some weird things going on where mobs that normally<br/>
don&#39;t run until quite hurt were running away at over 50% health.  This made<br/>
the Chains nerf really a big deal.  We had to zone twice because I couldn&#39;t<br/>
even hardly slow the mobs fleeing sine they were running away so early.<br/>
Anyone know if this is a permanent change?<br/>
