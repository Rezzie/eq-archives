<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050347527">Anyone else notice that we now strum the back side of our lutes.  I am also<br/>
a bit disappointed that we play everything so fast.  The strumming<br/>
animation is over in less then half the &quot;old&quot; time.  It&#39;s like I am playing<br/>
death metal now, with out the head banging.<br/>

&gt;After waiting all day for servers to come up - and all night for patch to<br/>
&gt;work - I log into the &quot;New and Improved&quot; game to discover that bard songs<br/>
&gt;are basically 99 pct broken.  You&#39;ll sing songs and every 30 minutes or so -<br/>
&gt;you&#39;ll get about 3 ticks of the song - then it will stop working again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Nice testing Verant.  A few glitches on release - okay I can live with<br/>
&gt;that - but completely breaking one of the classes - Way to go!<br/>
