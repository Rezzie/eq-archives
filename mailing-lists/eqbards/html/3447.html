<b>Subject:</b> Well balanced weapons <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-637762819">Does anyone know if well balanced weapons sell back to vendors for close to the<br/>
sale price like combines do?<br/>
<br/>
For example I bought my combine longsword for 52p 6g and the vendor will buy it<br/>
back for 47p 6g. So if I were to buy a well balanced longsword for around 230pp<br/>
would I get close to that when selling IT back?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

P.S. I know there are better weapons for the money, but if the well balanced<br/>
sell for close to buying price then I can &quot;rent&quot; one for a small fee until I<br/>
find a deal on one of the better weapons.</div>
