<div id="ygrps-yiv-299520612">Did my First Fear Raid last night.  Have to say was one of the most boring<br/>
nights I&#39;ve ever had in Everquest.  The Plane had been broken early Saturday<br/>
morning (I believe they said at 9:30 AM CDT) and I got there in anticipation<br/>
of a respawn at approx 9:30 PM EDT.  I left at about 3:30.<br/>
<br/>
We saw maybe 2-3 dozen mobs over the course of about 5.5 hours camped there<br/>
and no Bard stuff Dropped.  I was the only Bard - so it would have been nice<br/>
if I got a couple of Imbrued.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone know any details of Respawns?   The folks there were expecting a<br/>
major spawn at between 12-14 hours - but we saw nothing of the sort.<br/>
