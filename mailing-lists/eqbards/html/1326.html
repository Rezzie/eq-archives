<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155811052">There is an NPC in South Karana who is a member of the unkempt druids.  She<br/>
is constantly SoC (Spirit of Cheetah) and she will easily outrun a bard with<br/>
a drum.  Also Captain Shralok in Kithicor Forest can keep up with the sung<br/>
version of Accelerando.  Just curious, has anyone discovered whether or not<br/>
accelerando&#39;s speed increases with levels?  I am lv 24, and I havent really<br/>
noticed any difference, but then i use the song much every level and i<br/>
couldnt really tell even if there was a difference.  <br/>

There are mobs that can keep up with you with Accelerando<br/>
*with* a drum.<br/>
