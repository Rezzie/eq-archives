<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011735064">Was wondering if any one here has taken there bard to kill avick guards. If<br/>
any one has. Could you please tell me what level they could solo one and<br/>
what tactics they used. This is my first times playing a bard! Over my<br/>
shaman the songs are kinda a strange to me!<br/>
