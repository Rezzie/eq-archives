<div id="ygrps-yiv-513612188">Uh, our chanter does one AoE mez and routinely takes out 4-5 mobs.  All he<br/>
does is mez, sit, mez, sit and he keeps &#39;em under indef.  If he gets a<br/>
resist he just mezzes &#39;em all again with AoE.  He only hits two hotkeys.<br/>

Clarity, Aoe Stun, target, mez, target, mez, target, mez, target, mez,<br/>
meditate, target, mez, all in order, etc. etc. Is not the same thing as<br/>
hitting one hotkey.</div>
