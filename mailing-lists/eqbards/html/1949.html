<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632343148">I recommend South Karanas for Aviaks, East Karanas for various beasts, or the<br/>
Gorge of King Xorbb (Beholder) for Chasm and Gorge Minotaurs.  You can probably<br/>
do some soloing in any of those three areas if a group is hard to find.<br/>

&gt; I am a lvl 17 bard trying to find a good place to hunt.  I am mostly around<br/>
&gt; Oasis but willing to travel for exp and loot.  I need a good place with<br/>
&gt; decent amount of plp to group with.  I tried Unrest, and Highpass.  It seems<br/>
&gt; that no one wants a bard because we attract too much attentions.  Please<br/>
&gt; give suggestions.<br/>
