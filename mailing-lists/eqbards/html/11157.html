 I assume you are speaking to me even though you fail to quote a single <br/>
line....If you read that perhaps a lil more slowly it is quite apparent I was <br/>
being sarcastic. It was in response to you saying you wish bards would quit <br/>
using selo&#39;s to break root as it is an exploit. <br/>
Some people like to use /sarcasm off or whatever, I refuse to. If you cannot <br/>
comprehend that I&#39;m being sarcastic by the words I use (seriously, who uses <br/>
&quot;Oh my!&quot;?) then that is a failure in your department and not mine.<br/>
