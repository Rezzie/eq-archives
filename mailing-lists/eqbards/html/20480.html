&gt; you need to be within melee range. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks!  That makes a ton of difference.  I was nowhere *near* melee<br/>
range for most, if not all, of my attempts.  Goes under the heading of<br/>
&quot;things I wish I had known before.&quot;  Perhaps I will make it back to Perma<br/>
some day soon, afterall.<br/>
