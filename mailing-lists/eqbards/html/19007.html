<div id="ygrps-yiv-769162959">They failed to mention in today&#39;s patch message that the AC on our<br/>
singing steel armor has been adjusted to match our fellow plate wearer&#39;s<br/>
AC accordingly.<br/>
So 16 AC on gloves, 21 AC on boots, etc. Now they just need to fix the<br/>
Belt of Concordance AC.<br/>
