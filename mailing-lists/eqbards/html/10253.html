It will take forever to get the first few points through actually using<br/>
it.  I tried to do begging from scratch while waiting for the boat.  I<br/>
think I had to hit that button about 200-300 times before I got the<br/>
begging(1) message.  What can I say I took the boat a lot in my youth back<br/>
in the days when there was only one boat travelling from Butcherblock and<br/>
Freeport ^_^.<br/>

&gt; like many skills (e.g. warrior&#39;s double attack) i thought we had to put 1<br/>
