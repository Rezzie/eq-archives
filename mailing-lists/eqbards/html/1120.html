<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480075888">Look for the Bardic Voices series by Mercedes Lackey for spellsinging bards<br/>
in a fantasy medieval setting.<br/>
<br/>
_Bard_, by MORGAN Llywelyn, is a historical novel about the coming of the<br/>
Irish to Ireland, with a bard as the central character.<br/>
<br/>
For spellsinging more than bards, try the Spellsong Cycle series by L.E.<br/>
Modesitt.<br/>
