<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747672893">Not sure what you mean by broken haste - just for that particular item or<br/>
haste in general?  Like Tyunes said - if that is truly a haste item - it&#39;s<br/>
value will be dramatically higher.<br/>
<br/>
In general - I would advise you to try to upgrade your weapons.  Unless you<br/>
are planning on getting Dragon faction (and perhaps that could even be<br/>
repaired) you should go to Skyshrine and camp the Sentry and Guardian Armor.<br/>
At 49 you&#39;ll even get some XP.<br/>
<br/>
Also - you could go to Icewell Keep and &quot;beg&quot; for armor drops if you can&#39;t<br/>
get higher levels to let you group with them (if you aren&#39;t pro-Coldains -<br/>
you may even get a group as people always like a mana battery even if you<br/>
are low level wise).<br/>
