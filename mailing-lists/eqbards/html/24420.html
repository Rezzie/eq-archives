<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132277436">I was trying to experiment with Song of Twilight stacking with enchanter<br/>
mez.  Does anyone know how they work together.  Our thoughts (I was with my<br/>
new guild&#39;s big enchanter killing imps and discussing this.  She had to log<br/>
before we got to test it) were if I could lay down a SoT or 2 until the<br/>
chanters got the mobs locked down, it would be a huge boon for raids.<br/>
<br/>
Does SoT block any/all enchanter mez?<br/>
Does it overwrite?<br/>
<br/>
I will try to test this on my own, but how often do you have a lvl 60<br/>
enchanter at your disposal?<br/>
