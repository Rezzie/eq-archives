<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770134151">I used this song till lvl 50 (verses of victory) and still consider using it<br/>
sometimes.  It is a str/dex/AC buff which stacks with pretty much every buff<br/>
spell out there.  There are times where you will best serve your group by<br/>
banging away Chant of Battle on your Bongos...<br/>
<br/>
Lvl 2: CHords of discord:<br/>
Area of effect DOT song.  Greatly enhanced by using a stringed instrument.<br/>
You will actually find this song more useful once you get to lvl 18 and want<br/>
to do an all instruement attack with this, Hymm and the lvl 18 AOE DOT.  It<br/>
damages scale well, and eventually it comes close to the damage of the<br/>
higher lvl DOT songs.<br/>
