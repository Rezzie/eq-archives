<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587226842">it is the new alenia&#39;s disenchanting melody i guess, it does nothing yet<br/>
hehe.<br/>
<br/>
brusco&#39;s bombastic bellow is on the FV vendor now, level 55 song.  it is a<br/>
brass song that does 222 DD and 8 second stun, 5 minute recast time (what my<br/>
friend said spdat showed).  he said the program he used shows it to require<br/>
a horn, but this program also says that for charm so it could be wrong.<br/>
