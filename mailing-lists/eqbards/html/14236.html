<div id="ygrps-yiv-804117733">Here&#39;s a screenshot of a Gnoll chorus line that I took in Blackburrow on the<br/>
main bridge.  At the time I was fairly high level, say mid 30s.  I held a<br/>
train of about 30 Gnolls dead in its tracks while folks 8 - 15 took them<br/>
down.  A few of them that weren&#39;t engaged did attack, but it was infrequent.<br/>
This was after we all felt like the song had been nerfed.<br/>
