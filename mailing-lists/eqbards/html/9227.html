This week, I went to Sol A with some friends to hunt the Sol Mage and Sol Champion. Anyway, I am a level 30 Bard, and I was grouped with a level 30 Rogue, level 29 Druid, and a level 45 Druid. While we were killing the gobs, the rogue and I were both getting exp, but neither of the druids were.<br/>
<br/>
For the level 45, they were too green, and for the level 29, it would seem to support the (level / 10) * 5 formula...<br/>
