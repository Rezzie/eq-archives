<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-526359786">At the recommendation of this list, I&#39;ve had my druid friend bind me to<br/>
the Arena for the exploration of South Karana and Paw.  Now, I wonder...<br/>
What if there&#39;s no canoe available at the Arena dock when I find myself<br/>
shivering and naked, far from my corpse?  At what level (chorus, octave,<br/>
season, or what have you) is it safe to just swim across Lake Rathe to<br/>
the gnolls&#39; dock?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
