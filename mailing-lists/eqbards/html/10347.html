 </span></blockquote>Grrr.  The increase in effectiveness is entirely due to number<br/>
of mobs.  It&#39;s just nicer to have more party members because<br/>
that increases your survivability, which is true anyway<br/>
regardless of Psalm.  Having more party members actually makes<br/>
Psalm account for a smaller percentage of the total damage<br/>
applied to the mobs - the mobs die quicker so they have less<br/>
time to beat themselves against your damage shields.<br/>
