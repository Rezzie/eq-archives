<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-513699192">I used levitate last night for the first time since the patch.  One thing<br/>
that I like about it now is that you no longer get the message &quot;You feel as<br/>
if you are about to fall&quot; every time the song pulses.  Thats one less spam<br/>
message we have to deal with.  <br/>
