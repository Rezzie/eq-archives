 </span></blockquote>  Yup, in oasis.  I&#39;ve never encountered a shaman one in<br/>
  lake rathe, unless it was a shaman with his pet lost somewhere.<br/>
  <br/>
  I&#39;ve never even tracked a deepwater goblin pet in lakerathe.<br/>
  And I&#39;ve killed like over 50 or so of them there.  And often<br/>
  roam around looking for strange things.<br/>
   <br/>
  So for Shada.... ;p<br/>
