<div id="ygrps-yiv-494695224">That&#39;s how you do it.. /assist &lt;name&gt; BUT, you have to be in fairly close<br/>
proximity, and mine won&#39;t work if I&#39;m staring at my spell book and hit the<br/>
number key associated with it.  For some reason when I&#39;m looking at my<br/>
spellbook I actually have to hit the palette key with the mouse.  Hope it<br/>
works!<br/>
