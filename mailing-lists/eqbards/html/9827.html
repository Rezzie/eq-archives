<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303879100">I had a question after reading the analysis a bit.  What happens if you cast<br/>
MELANIE&#39;s MELLIFLUOUS MOTION while you are looking thru someone else&#39;s eyes<br/>
via LYSSA&#39;s SOLIDARITY of VISION.  Do you teleport to somewhere within your<br/>
line-of-sight or their&#39;s?  If its their&#39;s this could have some interesting<br/>
repercussions.<br/>
