<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-578414959">I haven&#39;t the skills to do it myself, but I know of a few people who only<br/>
sell the banded they are wearing.  Thus they don&#39;t run into the problem of<br/>
making a full suit then finding their customer now only wants pants.  The<br/>
only new pieces they make are replacements for themselves.  These folks will<br/>
also generally charge 1.5 plat per AC, as opposed to the 1p standard.  But<br/>
you don&#39;t have to wait.<br/>
