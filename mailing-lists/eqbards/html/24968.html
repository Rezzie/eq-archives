<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333159725">Definitely get one.  About 6 months ago a monk in the guild gave my wife a<br/>
flower once, it is white and not stackable but don&#39;t remember the name, and<br/>
she won 5 big lottoes in a row, including Donal&#39;s legs and a Sarnak Battle<br/>
Shield.  Nice good luck charm heh.<br/>

&gt; remember where.  Does anyone know where you can get flowers <br/>
&gt; in EQ?  Foraged,<br/>
&gt; bought, it doesn&#39;t matter.  Thanks. ;-)<br/>
