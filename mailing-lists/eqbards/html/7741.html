40 or more points per swing, and I&#39;m still doing high and mid teens, so it&#39;s<br/>
a bad thing if I give up my weapons(unless we&#39;re tank heavy of course).<br/>
<br/>
	As far as procs go, I&#39;ve heard numerous rumors that dex plays a<br/>
large part in it, but someone last week said wisdom may have had something<br/>
to do with it.  I&#39;d beleive DEX, just because it&#39;s a melee type stat,<br/>
whereas wisdom is a preist-casting stat.<br/>
