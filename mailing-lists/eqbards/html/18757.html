bah hehe, yes and rogue legs too (they have 50 mana LOL).  VS seems to be<br/>
the leg guy.  i heard the cazic-thule server killed him as well yesterday,<br/>
so if word spreads how to kill him he&#39;ll probably be buffed soon.  but not<br/>
before we get another legs after today&#39;s patch =)  the 56 bard in my guild<br/>
got those legs, he&#39;s also the guild leader and plays a bit more than me and<br/>
has tons of points to use on loot.  i had won the RBB at Vox right before we<br/>
did VS.  i knew for a fact if i used my points on the RBB that those legs<br/>
would drop.<br/>
