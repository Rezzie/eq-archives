&gt;Sure, EQ graphics are very sexist.  I&#39;m a female, and knowing what I know <br/>
&gt;about internet and RPG likely customers, I very well might have decided that<br/>
&gt;the current graphics were the right job decision.  Yep, as a female.  Its<br/>
&gt;still sexist, and I still hate the lack of graphics which would appeal to <br/>
&gt;female player.<br/>
