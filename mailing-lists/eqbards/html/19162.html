<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548317767">hah, funniest duel I have ever been in was in the Arena zone.  Me and an<br/>
enchanter were dueling using a cleric as a pet.  The chanter would charm the<br/>
cleric I would use Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aria to cancel his charm then<br/>
re-charm the cleric.  The chanter would cancel magic and recharm. LOL.  At<br/>
one point we BOTH had an active charm on the cleric!  BTW Clerics make very<br/>
poor pets ;)<br/>
