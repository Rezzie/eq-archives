<div id="ygrps-yiv-406608225">You can now no longer use Selo&#39;s Consonant Chains on rooted, ensnared or<br/>
SoW&#39;d mobs.<br/>
The rooted or ensnared part I dont mind, but not being able to chain<br/>
SoW&#39;d or SoC&#39;d mobs is very aggravating. When they flee, they cannot be<br/>
stopped. Especially in dungeons where the NPCs can cast SoW indoors,<br/>
although PCs cannot. The mob will flee from you and bring back a nice<br/>
train.<br/>
