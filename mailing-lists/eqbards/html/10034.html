<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022963019">Wow, i assume this was bard only as well?  i know people who have seen the<br/>
Maestro with a mace, but they were unable to kill him that night.  i assumed<br/>
it was the cleric mace Dawnfire.  by the way, the Six Note Blade can be held<br/>
in either hand, therefore a bard can duel wield two 11 25 weapons.<br/>
amazingly nice.<br/>

&gt; 	Friend of mine got a mace called &#39;Evensong&#39; last night. <br/>
&gt; 11/25 wgt 3. Same<br/>
