<div id="ygrps-yiv-705847516">I must admit when I first selected my Half Elf bard I was shocked at the skimpy outfit. I bet those little red undies are not that comfortable, especially if they are made from leather.<br/>
<br/>
But to settle the arguement my boyfriend (who has a 40th Level Enchanter) has said the Half Elf are definatly the best looking, thats why I choose this race.<br/>
