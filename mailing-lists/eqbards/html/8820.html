&gt; &gt;Genni is currently broken at least on Cazic Thule,<br/>
&gt; &gt;prolly on all servers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s not broken on Innoruuk, and I would doubt she is broken<br/>
&gt; on any &#39;intelligent&#39; server where stoopid noob f&#39;ing idiots<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t attack her.<br/>

an exploit.  You could buy fire opals from her for 55 plat, then turn around and sell them to a<br/>
vendor for a profit!  So GMs shut them down.<br/>
