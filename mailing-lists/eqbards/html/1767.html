<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181874344">When singing songs that damage harm or affect NPC&#39;s, will singing in their native tongue increase the affect of the song they have become an audience to?<br/>
<br/>
If not, why not?<br/>
<br/>
BTW... This is one of the best forums that I&#39;m a participant in.  Thanks to the organizers, the maintainers, and the other participants.  Keep playing that song.<br/>
