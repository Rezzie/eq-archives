<div id="ygrps-yiv-148585956">I escaped the evil flu, seem to be immune to it ever since having it real<br/>
bad (hospitalized) when I was a kid.  However, nearly everyone else I know<br/>
in Denver has had it at some point over the last month. ;-(<br/>
<br/>
Hope you feel better, EQ and plenty of rest generally don&#39;t mix. ;-(<br/>

On another note, does anyone else have this damn flu going around? *cries*<br/>
