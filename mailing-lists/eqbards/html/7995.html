 </span></blockquote>I imagine only to the attractive women. I have started<br/>
playing a female high-elf enchantress, and one of my<br/>
biggest problems is people stopping me to tell me how<br/>
attractive i am. It leads to some pretty cool rp<br/>
converstaions, actually. Though one time I was sitting<br/>
down, about to camp in Freeport. A dwarf in plate runs<br/>
past me, stops, turns around and stands in front of me<br/>
and says, &quot;You&#39;re pretty.&quot; So I said, &quot;Thanks.&quot; He<br/>
said, &quot;can I give you anything?&quot; I thought that was<br/>
pretty funny.<br/>
