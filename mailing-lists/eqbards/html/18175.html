Thanks for bringing this back up front. I was looking for it earlier.<br/>

Yes, it appears that we introduced a bug last week that capped a bards<br/>
attempts to charm at their level. This unintentionally affected the lower<br/>
level charm song as well as the upper level. We&#39;ll be fixing this when we<br/>
patch spells next. No other charm spells were affected.<br/>

Now, if only we could get them to look at the inability to refresh charm<br/>
till it&#39;s worn off.<br/>
