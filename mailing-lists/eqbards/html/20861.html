<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927947302">Well folks, Elfson has gotten the hell out of... well hell (part 2).  So at<br/>
lvl 36, I think its time to get my guise of deciever.<br/>
<br/>
I have some maps of Lower (and Upper) guk, and have bought a few invis to<br/>
undead potions.<br/>
<br/>
Any reccomendations for making it to the assasin room?  Whats the easiest<br/>
path there?  How do I change over from normal invis to invis to undead<br/>
(without becoming visible and dying)?<br/>
<br/>
thanks :)<br/>
