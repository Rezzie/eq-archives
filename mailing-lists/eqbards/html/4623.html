<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898858774">Ok, i thought i followed the<br/>
quest through but i need some<br/>

I took both the sheets of the<br/>
winds of karana to valen, but<br/>
after giving him sheet two<br/>
from the lady in north karana<br/>
he said he still needed one<br/>
more.  Would someone please<br/>
post or email me the complete<br/>
quest so I can see where I<br/>
screwed up or need to go<br/>
next.  I&#39;m getting irritated.<br/>
