&gt; The total safety of the hunting there causes people to learn terrible group<br/>

&gt; 99% of the time if I find myself grouped with someone who levelled through<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s not that ALL people who played there are bad, it&#39;s that most are.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No offense to anyone who&#39;s hunted there religiously but HK just isn&#39;t the<br/>
