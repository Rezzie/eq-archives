<div id="ygrps-yiv-751423583">Okay, here is my source about SoW, it is from a guildmate. The perception<br/>
thing may cover the first case, and the two may not be connected, but I<br/>
thought I would include it incase it inspires any new info.<br/>
<br/>
============================<br/>
<br/>
There are instances where the client will say you have spirit of wolf<br/>
up...but you aren&#39;t moving any faster. I have noticed this a few times but<br/>
have been unable to discover the exact reason or pattern as to how and why<br/>
this occurs.<br/>
<br/>
The one bug I can verify and duplicate is one where you don&#39;t have the<br/>
spirit of wolf icon up but you are definitely SoWed. It will not wear off<br/>
until you zone or die. The catch is to get this way you first have to die.<br/>
Rather expensive and inconvenient if you ask me. You&#39;re better off getting<br/>
some Journeyman Boots.<br/>
<br/>
The point being the client/server have trouble sometimes correctly keeping<br/>
track of what your movement speed should be. Nice if you get the perma SoW<br/>
but it sucks arse if you get the opposite.<br/>
