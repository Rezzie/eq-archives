&gt; I have seen too many high level rants about stupid lower levels. Even my<br/>
&gt; friend does it sometimes, after a particularly frustrating night. And I<br/>
&gt; never ever want to be seen in that light.<br/>

for stuff.  Here&#39;s a conversation that went on over /shout<br/>
while I was in GFay.  A high level necro and enchanter were<br/>
kiting the Priest of Discord while their pets beat him up<br/>
(yes, they killed him):<br/>
<br/>
Newbie:  Why is the PoD running around?<br/>
Kiter:  We&#39;re kiting him.<br/>
Newbie:  What&#39;s kiting?<br/>
Kiter:  We run out of attack range while hitting him with spells.<br/>
Newbie:  Why u kill PoD?<br/>
Kiter:  For the loot he carries.<br/>
Newbie:  What does PoD drop?<br/>
Kiter:  A really crappy staff.<br/>
Newbie:  Can I have PoD staff?<br/>
[pause]<br/>
Newbie:  Can I have PoD staff?<br/>

Newbie:  Can I have PoD staff?<br/>

This is usually the level of stupidity high level folks are<br/>
ranting about when they mutter &quot;stupid lower levels.&quot;  I<br/>
seriously doubt anyone capable of subscribing themselves to<br/>
this list would fall into that category.<br/>
