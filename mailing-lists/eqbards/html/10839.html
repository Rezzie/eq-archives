--------------------<br/>
The following changes and enhancements have been introduced with the latest <br/>
patch:<br/>
<br/>
*Monk Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
The Feign Death changes which were mentioned on November 16th are now live.<br/>
<br/>
*Spell Enhancements*<br/>
<br/>
Tishan (Enchanter) and Malise (Magician/Shaman) spells now stack.<br/>
<br/>
The Pet bug (where if you have a pet, certain monsters can attack its owner <br/>
anywhere in the zone) has been fixed.<br/>
<br/>
Alenia`s Disenchanting Melody (Bard) should now work<br/>
<br/>
Screaming Terror (Necromancer) has changed. It is no longer a &quot;Run Away&quot; <br/>
Fear spell - instead the targeted creature will cower in terror until it <br/>
takes damage (similar to the Enchanter&#39;s Mesmerize spell). The Environment <br/>
limit (Dungeons only) has been removed.<br/>
<br/>
Pact of Shadow (Necromancer) now has a 12 second recast time<br/>
<br/>
Summon Waterstone (Magician) has been added to the game.<br/>
