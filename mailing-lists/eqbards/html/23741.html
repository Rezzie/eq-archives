<div id="ygrps-yiv-1395394137">The group really does have an impact - and I think dynamics change at<br/>
different level ranges.  I&#39;ve been in tank heavy that kicked butt - and<br/>
others that ended having groups run to zone every fourth pull.  I remember<br/>
an all(?) tank Karnor Moat once - people kept rooting mobs that cast heal -<br/>
when I was yelling that I was using charm as crowd control...<br/>

Was it the group, or does the charm song make that much of a difference?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m amazed...I can&#39;t for the life of me figure out what was suddenly so<br/>
right about being a bard in a group...and getting that much xp.  Hehe...<br/>
