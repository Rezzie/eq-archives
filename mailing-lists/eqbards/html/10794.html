<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699995354">Broon was running amuck last night and scaring innocents throughout E K. I, a 21st Song Hero, bravely ran up, got his attention, and proceeded with my plan... (Umm, Hero Boy, this is your brain. Thanks for the emergency request for a plan. I&#39;ll get back to you). So I ran around for awhile avoiding hits, trying to figure out where to drag the cyclops child, when suddenly a lovely vision in blue swept in to save the day.<br/>
<br/>
Sylly proceeded to whack away on Baby Broon so I joined in. He cons yellow to me now and I was surprised when my Largos and DDD actually worked! Once he got down to a sliver, Broon paused as a glow surrounded him. Sylly says, &quot;Finish him off, Opera&quot;. Not waiting to consider the full meaning of her words (Brain, stop wasting your 286 processing on the plan, we&#39;re ok now), I whacked Mono Focal a couple more times and he went down like a third-string QB. <br/>
<br/>
But I was amazed at the next line to scroll by: &quot;You gain experience!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sylly had charmed Broon and left me as the only attacker when it wore off. I was not aware that there was a memory blur effect with charm regarding hits taken. But seeing is believing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Sylly!<br/>
