I camped my bard in Rivervale and logged in with a low-level druid from <br/>
Kelethin that I play around with sometimes - checked the bard guild, and LO! <br/>
There she is! The spell-merchant selling lvl 8 and 15 songs was at her <br/>
normal post (second room of guildhall, on the left). I guess she WAS out <br/>
having a drink after all (or up on the roof?)...<br/>
