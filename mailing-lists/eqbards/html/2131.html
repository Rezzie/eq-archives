<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079130135">Sometimes I can only play for an hour or two, and at these times it just<br/>
isn&#39;t worth my while to find a group (or fair to them either).  So when I<br/>
solo, this is a great little tune.  There&#39;s the bard, surrounded, and<br/>
someone rushes up and asks, &quot;Need help?&quot;  To which I reply, &quot;O don&#39;t bother,<br/>
I&#39;m a bard.&quot;<br/>
