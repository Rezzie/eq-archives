<div id="ygrps-yiv-808729949">After waiting all day for servers to come up - and all night for patch to<br/>
work - I log into the &quot;New and Improved&quot; game to discover that bard songs<br/>
are basically 99 pct broken.  You&#39;ll sing songs and every 30 minutes or so -<br/>
you&#39;ll get about 3 ticks of the song - then it will stop working again.<br/>
<br/>
Nice testing Verant.  A few glitches on release - okay I can live with<br/>
that - but completely breaking one of the classes - Way to go!<br/>
