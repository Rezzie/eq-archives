<div id="ygrps-yiv-208538888">Sounds like from his account that the elves in E Commons were mostly<br/>
Feir&#39;Dal, but there was at least one &#39;good&#39; aligned dark elf among them.<br/>
Apparently they and several other servants of Tunare in Kithicor were slain<br/>
very early on in the event.  Apparently they were trying to tell the &#39;good&#39;<br/>
aligned PC&#39;s something, but I&#39;m not sure they got the chance.  At least one<br/>
person of a good aligned race of high level was instrumental in slaying some<br/>
of these &#39;good&#39; npc&#39;s.  Apparently a druid or two dedicated to Tunare<br/>
actually killed their own fellows and earned the wrath of several other GM&#39;s<br/>
(instant death)  as far as I can tell from guild reports there was no<br/>
retribution on &#39;evil&#39; pc&#39;s who were killing the &#39;good&#39; npc&#39;s, only on those<br/>
who did not role-play their allegiances accurately.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone been in Kithicor since?  I am very curious what I will wake up to<br/>
find there and how I will escape level 40+ mobs when I am camped about dead<br/>
center of the zone.<br/>
