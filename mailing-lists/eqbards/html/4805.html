&gt;If so, then I apologize. I&#39;m just growing weary of sarcasm as of late.<br/>
&gt;Newbies asking questions on the server that a simple yes or no question<br/>
&gt;would answer and all they&#39;re getting are long drawn out cut-downs from<br/>
&gt;&quot;holier than thou&quot; types. Drives me nuts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You misunderstand -- he&#39;s saying that people stack<br/>
&gt; &gt; Chant of Battle with Celerity because Celerity won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; stack with Anthem de Arms.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hrm, holier than thou? yeesh...<br/>
<br/>
I have been accused of being alot of things, kind, generous, helpful, <br/>
etc..but never that (and where was the &quot;cut-down&quot;?). You just took things <br/>
out of context i think..? No hard feelings tho.<br/>
