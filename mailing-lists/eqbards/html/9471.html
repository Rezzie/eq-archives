&gt;Apparently a druid or two dedicated to Tunare<br/>
&gt;actually killed their own fellows and earned the wrath of several other <br/>
&gt;GM&#39;s<br/>
&gt;(instant death)  as far as I can tell from guild reports there was no<br/>
&gt;retribution on &#39;evil&#39; pc&#39;s who were killing the &#39;good&#39; npc&#39;s, only on those<br/>
&gt;who did not role-play their allegiances accurately.<br/>
