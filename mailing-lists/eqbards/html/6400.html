<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494405981">Hatar is a RARE spawn in Oasis.<br/>
He&#39;s about level 23 but of course he hits<br/>
way too hard and often.<br/>
<br/>
I heard he has three drops. I only know of one.<br/>
Fine Silk Turbin.<br/>
For the fashion conscious, this is a great item<br/>
for your Head slot. AC 10 Save vs Fire +10 (I <br/>
think. Elyana can confirm this) and weighs <br/>
almost nothing. Monks love this item too. And<br/>
the best thing (at least for me, a human bard)<br/>
is that it looks like cloth. <br/>
