<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401119743">Well I was bored last night, playing my warrior twink (I will only play<br/>
Elfson with guildies and for big raids now that he is 47), and I get a tell<br/>
that a group has cleared the fire giants but has decided they are a bit weak<br/>
to drop Naggy, so &quot;How fast can you get your blue butt up to SolB?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Woohoo!  My first dragon run!<br/>
<br/>
They were pretty experienced at this, so things went very smoothly (one<br/>
melee group bit it when their bard went down), and he dropped very quickly<br/>
(or so it seemed to me).  I was in the xp group, which is a nice bonus...<br/>
<br/>
He even dropped his drum, which was given (deservedly so) to ther other bard<br/>
there who had been on several Naggy raids in the past.<br/>
<br/>
My original EQ goal has been accomplished!</div>
