&gt; Don&#39;t forget, however, at least according to our former inside source,<br/>
&gt; JM Cappozi, that they also massively increased the amount of exp<br/>
&gt; required to level shortly after this without telling us. Still,<br/>
&gt; psychologically, not losing 2+ bubbles when you die (man did <br/>
&gt; that suck)<br/>
&gt; is a lot easier to take, even if it takes just as long to <br/>
&gt; make back the<br/>
&gt; exp you lost as it did when you did lose it. </span></blockquote></div>
