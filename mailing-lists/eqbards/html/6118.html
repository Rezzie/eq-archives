I am level 24, armed with a dragoon dirk and a Polished Granite tomahawk.<br/>
Recently  a level 29 bard stopped by our group in SolA with a train *laughs*<br/>
and ended up getting the kill with his horn on several goblins. I was<br/>
flabergasted (given that we have a level 28 warrior and level 26 cleric and<br/>
wizard). So I have been playing the the horn and Dennons Dischord  then<br/>
swapping to the lute for chains or lull, then back to the horn. It&#39;s really<br/>
really hard to say, but I MAY be doing more damage now...do we have hard<br/>
figures on DDD? I am very very curious.<br/>
