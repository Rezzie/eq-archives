		Greetings all,<br/>
		I have enjoyed this list tremendously. My partner and I are<br/>
both level 10<br/>
		now and have been hunting in misty thicket. We are getting<br/>
bored there, we<br/>
		would like to travel to new lands, can anyone suggest some<br/>
good areas where<br/>
		we can hang our shingle up and not spend too much time<br/>
finding our corpses?<br/>
