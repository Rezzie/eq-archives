&gt;Why doesn&#39;t it make sense?  You physically stop growing in<br/>
&gt;your early 20s (years).  Athletes are considered at their<br/>
&gt;prime in their late 20s.  OTOH you continue to learn pretty<br/>
&gt;much right up until you die.  All the fantasy stories are full<br/>
&gt;of old well-learned mages living well past their years.<br/>
