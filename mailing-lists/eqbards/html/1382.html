&gt;One question...what is kiting and how is it done?  I have seen this a lot in<br/>
&gt;this group, but I am sorry, I have never heard of it before.<br/>

<br/>
kite - (v.) (usually &quot;kiting&quot;) To run around, deliberately training one or<br/>
more NPCs, killing them slowly with DoT spells, while staying just out of<br/>
their reach. e.g. &quot;Dontcha just hate when Bards are kiting, and they drag<br/>
Lockjaw down on you?&quot; <br/>

The EQ Glossary  - learn it, live it, love it ;)<br/>
