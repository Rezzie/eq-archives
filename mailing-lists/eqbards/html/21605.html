<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185188463">Has anyone found any more interesting uses of the new macro commands?<br/>
<br/>
I have experimented with a few for weaving, basically turning a 4 song weave<br/>
into a 2 macro weave.  The most powerful combination I have found thus far<br/>
is using Chants with Charm.  The macro lays the Chant, Charms the mob, and<br/>
sits the pet.  When the pet gets back up I know to reapply the hotkey.<br/>
<br/>
/pause 30, Cast 1<br/>
/pause 2, /stopsong<br/>
/pause 30, Cast 2<br/>
/pause 2, /stopsong<br/>
/pet sit<br/>
