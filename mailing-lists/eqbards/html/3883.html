<div id="ygrps-yiv-784376811">You&#39;ll recall I did some song timings and came up with<br/>
6 seconds between song pulses, and 3.5 seconds to start up a<br/>
song.<br/>
<br/>
If you leave Lullaby running, heads will nod once every <br/>
6 seconds.  If you immediately stop it and restart it when you<br/>
see the &quot;nods&quot; message, you can shorten this to 3.5-4 seconds.<br/>
<br/>
I tried doing it the latter way last night, and the rate that<br/>
it interrupted spellcasters went from about 50% to about 80%.<br/>
We even had several fights where the spellcasters didn&#39;t get a<br/>
single spell off because they nodded asleep before they could<br/>
finish casting.<br/>
