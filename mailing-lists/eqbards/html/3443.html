<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338362198">I found lullabye&#39;s greatest use not to be in sleeping<br/>
mobs, but in interupting caster.  Before I realized it<br/>
worked to interupt casters I could only marginaly solo<br/>
Aqua Goblin Shamans and Gnoll Soothsayers, now they<br/>
are easy, even if i don&#39;t twist any other song,<br/>
becuase it interupts them for me at least 8 to 9 times<br/>
out of 10</div>
