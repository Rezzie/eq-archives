<div id="ygrps-yiv-647601380">i am wondering if anyone can answer a question for me.  does the charred<br/>
guardian breastplate look the same as an enamelled black chestplate?  i know<br/>
the enamelled is purely black, but for some reason i thought the charred had<br/>
a charcoal look to it, not a pure black.  just curious, thanks for any<br/>
replies.<br/>
