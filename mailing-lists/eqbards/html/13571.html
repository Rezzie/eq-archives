<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646407794">My other persona is a Magician, and I&#39;ve gotta say that I like the new heals<br/>
quite a bit.  While it&#39;s true that it&#39;s more mana efficient to summon a new one,<br/>
you can&#39;t do that in combat. And since you can&#39;t have two pets, you must allow<br/>
one to go before you try.<br/>
<br/>
In combat, a dead pet = dead Mage, so keeping it alive till combat is over is a<br/>
huge plus.<br/>
