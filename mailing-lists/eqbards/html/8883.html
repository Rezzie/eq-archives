<div id="ygrps-yiv-897319076">Hello.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got my bard up to 10th level now, and really enjoy playing him.  I&#39;m<br/>
wondering if there&#39;s any sort of guild, or at least network of bards on the<br/>
Tunare server.  I would think that bards would like to form a guild, since<br/>
we&#39;re one of the more unique types of classes available.</div>
