<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093697144">Went to Freeport loaded with loot...<br/>
<br/>
Went to the Bards Guild, where I seem to always get the best prices. Checked<br/>
the prices on some items I wanted to sell and thought, &quot;Hey, I will try the<br/>
Carrilion song to raise my faction!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So, loaded it up, played it, and went to sell....<br/>
<br/>
And she offered LESS than what she had offered WITHOUT the song playing!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else have this happen?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Tallonn</div>
