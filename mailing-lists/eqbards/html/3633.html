<div id="ygrps-yiv-802994627">bellowing at the monster the person is fighting is a nice way to lend a<br/>
bit of help. as long as you are careful that you don&#39;t do more damage to<br/>
it than they do they&#39;ll get the kill.<br/>
<br/>
since hitting 23, i know just use chain to help people out. often the<br/>
monster will even start attacking me, and if it&#39;s green i&#39;ll let it swing<br/>
at me all it wants while the other person kills it. of course, people<br/>
would probably consider that twinking. oh no.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Only one man could kill this many russians. Find him, and bring his guitar to me.&quot;<br/>
