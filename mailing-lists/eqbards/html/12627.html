<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215334873">When I&#39;m fighting in lower guk and we get a multiple pull where a frog<br/>
wizard shows up, I immediately run up to it and start chaining pixie strike<br/>
non-stop until the pesky little croaker drops.  Their spells are nasty and<br/>
the situation is to grave for me not to do so IMHO.  I too have found about<br/>
80% interruption, I can usually keep em from getting off all but 1 or two<br/>
shots on the party.<br/>
