<div id="ygrps-yiv-406532690">Are you having fun playing your 21st shaman? If so then you (jackal) have<br/>
plenty of things to do to keep you occupied until the expansion comes out.<br/>
Your shaman still has to suffer from all the problems with the game that IMO<br/>
need to get fixed.  If you don&#39;t have fun playing anything but your 50 necro<br/>
then thats a different story.  <br/>

&gt; just want some new stuff I just need a place to hunt and I&#39;ve got a 21<br/>
&gt; shaman right now. There is plenty of places to hunt and there are quests<br/>
&gt; here and there but the bottom line is you guys can play  it&#39;s getting to<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; unplayable now to wherem ost people don&#39;t pla ytheir main chars at all or<br/>
&gt; rarely rather because of overcrowding. This is the problem I am forced to<br/>
&gt; play my mid level chars so there must be something right for you guys.<br/>
