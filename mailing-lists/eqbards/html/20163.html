<div id="ygrps-yiv-983456567">Here is what might have confused you.  Bard invis song will sometimes work<br/>
against the undead in Unrest.  Its all a function of what level you are.<br/>
When I went to Unrest at 19th level, it didn&#39;t work against any of the<br/>
undead there at all.  I went back in my 30s and almost all of the lower<br/>
level undead mobs couldn&#39;t see through it.  But it will never work against<br/>
the undead in LGuk.  <br/>

Ok, I had read conflicting reports that the invis song worked against the<br/>
undead. Guess not.<br/>
<br/>
I was in Lower Guk with my ranger the other day, 45 people and about 3 of<br/>
them not anon.<br/>
