<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308047877"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;What do you folks think of bards in general?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like my bard mainly for two reasons:<br/>
<br/>
A. Selo&#39;s Accelerando.<br/>
B. Ability to use both magic and fighting skills adequately without mana<br/>
concerns.<br/>
<br/>
The only other class I like near as much as a Bard is the Cleric class. I<br/>
thoroughly enjoyed that class as well. Magic & Fighting - but with the mana<br/>
to worry about.</div>
