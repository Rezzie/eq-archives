<div id="ygrps-yiv-611898704">In case any bards out there are also tailors like me the recipe for the<br/>
Glowing Silk gloves has been discovered.  And before Verant chaned the Book<br/>
of Wu to make it easier to figure out!  They are AC4 and unfortunately as<br/>
feared Monk only.  Oh well, I guess I should at least be relieved that I<br/>
enjoy merchanting and that they aren&#39;t No Drop.  Maybe someday I&#39;ll be able<br/>
to tailor something actually worth my wearing again.<br/>
