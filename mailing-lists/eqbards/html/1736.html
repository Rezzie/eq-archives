<div id="ygrps-yiv-803501934">About mermaids, <br/>
	When i got logged off on the boat in the OOT , i had to swim to any <br/>
island. needless to say i ended up on the island you first pass going from <br/>
kaladim to freeport. ( the ones with the aqua goblins ans alluring sirens) <br/>
And Alluring sirens are mermaids! well in the conventional sense. Long hair , <br/>
no top, big fish tail. I figure this is what you saw , or its just a Verant <br/>
color/size / name thing . y&#39;know they change its colors and size and slap a <br/>
different name on it . I will tell you a secret about the sirens though . <br/>
They give NO LOOT - except money ........but . The first time i killed them i <br/>
got 2 silver , next like 8 silver , then 5 gold , and so on . got about 3 pp <br/>
each , then i had to jump boat and logg . don&#39;t know if this is a bug or a <br/>
neat little secret. i plan to go back and check to see if it keeps going up , <br/>
but i haven&#39;t had the time. <br/>
