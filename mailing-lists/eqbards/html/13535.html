<div id="ygrps-yiv-470728112">Those heal pet spells (as far as I can see) are no great things.  Its<br/>
more mana efficient to just recast a full health pet for most levels<br/>
then to heal it...  I guess its nice if you get a really killer pet, but<br/>
I dont think magcians are real excited by the pet heal spells...<br/>
