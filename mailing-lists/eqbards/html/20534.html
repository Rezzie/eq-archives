<div id="ygrps-yiv-613035559">That&#39;s really weird, that&#39;s the only class I have not tried as well.  What&#39;s<br/>
your other one?  I am having fun playing my rogue right now since my bard is<br/>
pretty group dependent these days and everyone seems to be super busy this<br/>
summer.<br/>

I do believe that it&#39;s a shadowknight quest, but haven&#39;t tested it<br/>
yet! ;-)  That&#39;s one of the two classes I&#39;ve never tried!</div>
