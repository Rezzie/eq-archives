<div id="ygrps-yiv-191938002">Spots 1 to 8 of the Spellbook is my memmed spells (in order)<br/>
Last 2 on that page are 2 most commonly switched in spells (usually ac buff<br/>
and symbol)<br/>
<br/>
Next page is resists on 3, other buffs on 4.<br/>
Pages 5 and 6 are misc common spells (abundant food/drink, bind affinity,<br/>
gate, invis to undead)<br/>
Page 7 are DD spells and stuns, page 8 various heals/cures.<br/>
<br/>
After that its pretty much a mish mosh of spells I never use...</div>
