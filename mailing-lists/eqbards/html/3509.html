<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319263758">Other than the names, both the lute and the battle drum appear exactly the same as<br/>
their contemporary counterparts. Same animation and item graphic.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I have the drum as well. Here&#39;s hard facts on the Mistmoore Battle Drum - same<br/>
&gt; &gt;weight (0.5) as a hand drum,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does it have the same inventory graphic?  Does it suffer from the same<br/>
&gt; (silly, frustrating, unacknowledged) confusion with the flute graphic that<br/>
&gt; we see when it&#39;s on the ground or in your hand?<br/>
&gt; </span></blockquote></div>
