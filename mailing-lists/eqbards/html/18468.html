<div id="ygrps-yiv-623583488">bard in my guild hit 55.  i guess i misunderstood the cap on parry being 75.<br/>
he is currently at 55, and it had not gone up yet though he hadn&#39;t done much<br/>
tanking so far since he levelled.  his dodge is around 135.  the level 55<br/>
bellow, supposedly which does 220DD and an 8 second stun, actually heals the<br/>
mob (i wish that was funny).  the level 55 mana song heals for 11 points per<br/>
tick singing, and he has not tested the mana aspect yet.  sounds like this<br/>
could be a rather good song with a Kelin&#39;s Lute (20+ heal per tick as well<br/>
as probably double clarity/mana song).<br/>
