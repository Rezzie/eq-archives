 </span></blockquote>I like your later points, but this is totally untrue.  My point was they do<br/>
succeed just as well in Sol A without me.  Only difference is they take<br/>
turns seeing who dies once per night instead of me every night.  They get<br/>
just as much xp and loot in the same amount of time.  They don&#39;t need a tank<br/>
in Sol A and having someone who can only tank and not very well just means<br/>
that person gets to be the nightly martyr who dies in the bad pull.  Might<br/>
as well have it be a caster who can be back in 30 seconds.<br/>
