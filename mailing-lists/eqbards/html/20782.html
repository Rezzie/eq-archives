<div id="ygrps-yiv-917134756">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Just started charm kiting in the Rathe Mtns.  Last<br/>
night the cyclops were spawning 4 and 5 at a<br/>
time....this morning there were none at all and they<br/>
didn&#39;t spawn for the hour or so I played before going<br/>
to work.  Is there a placeholder for the cyclops in<br/>
this zone?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
