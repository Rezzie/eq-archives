<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-809069856">I got a gnoll hide lariat last night from splitpaw, stats are 3 dam 20 delay<br/>
magic war rog ran brd ac 3 effect stun.  Sounded like a great off hand<br/>
weapon to me, better yet its a whip that cracks every 2 seconds much to the<br/>
agony of my group (big grin), but then again I&#39;m a sucker for procs (hence I<br/>
actually would admit to desperately wanting Crookstinger, but I saw another<br/>
poisoning weapon drops in splitpaw too...a 10/38 1hs strong poison).  Its<br/>
not lore, so who knows I might try and get another to REALLY liven things up<br/>
with the sound of whip cracking rawhide.<br/>
<br/>
One problem:  my will is insufficient. :P<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else got one and know what level it starts making mobs REALLY mad at<br/>
me?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
