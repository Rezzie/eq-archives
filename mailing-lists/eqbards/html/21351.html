<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-196416879">An excellent discussion to be sure.  Unfortunately acknowledging this would<br/>
put Verant in the position of admitting they are wrong and just don&#39;t care.<br/>
Good to see exact numbers from an enchanter on how many mobs he can keep<br/>
mez&#39;d forever with both Clarity and Clarity II.  Seeing they could control<br/>
15 even cons long enough for an evac was an eye opener even for me.  Even<br/>
before Lullaby was &#39;fixed&#39; a bard would not have been able to do that.  The<br/>
first one to break would likely bash him and end the song routine.<br/>

this is a very well written thread discussing the effects of constant<br/>
refreshes on our resist rates.<br/>
