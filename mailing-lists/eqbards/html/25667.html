<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981879069">OK, serious question here...<br/>
<br/>
trying to train up my brass skill, doesn&#39;t seem to work without a <br/>
target.  I&#39;ve been using Denon&#39;s area of effect in &#39;safe&#39; places and it <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to increase my skill.<br/>
<br/>
Do I have to wait til group effect song comes on line before I can train by <br/>
sitting in a safe place and singing?  Or should I use another song?<br/>
