armor that will turn a bit of cash.  You won&#39;t gain much experience but you<br/>
can make steady money.<br/>

Going into Crushbone is not entirely safe.  Trains abound, and there&#39;s this<br/>
dark elf called Ambassador D&#39;Vinn who will clean your clock in short order.<br/>
 Keep your Accelerando handy, and know the way out.<br/>
