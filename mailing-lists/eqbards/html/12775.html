&gt;My base CHA is 132 now, with my Crude Stein (CHA 147) prices are<br/>
&gt;unchanged.<br/>
&gt;In order to test this, check prices on expensive items like<br/>

&gt;charisma from 50 to 200 might not appreciably change the cost of<br/>
&gt;muffins. =<br/>

as 129<br/>
charisma (The highest she can make so far)<br/>
<br/>
I have not tried taking off more charisma stuff and seeing how this affects<br/>
<br/>
(Oh, this after casting Alliance. Most Freeport merchants are apprehensive<br/>
before<br/>
and amiable after that)</div>
