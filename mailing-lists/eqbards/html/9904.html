<div id="ygrps-yiv-725781015">I need some assistance with Charm.  I&#39;ve had this song for several levels<br/>
now and just simply can&#39;t figure out the proper method of using it.  I see<br/>
messages from some of the talented bards on this list saying &quot;Yeah, two Hill<br/>
Giants, no biggie.  I just charmed them against one another and got both<br/>
kills.&quot;  I would be dead or zonign within 15 rounds if I tried this.  At<br/>
level 31 HGs are still red to me, so let&#39;s take the Choon and Froon brothers<br/>
as examples because they&#39;re blue.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how I think it should work (remember, my base INT is only 75):<br/>
<br/>
- Set up a hotkey panel with Selo&#39;s, Charm, &quot;/pet attack&quot;, &quot;/pet back off&quot;.<br/>
- Equip drum and fire up Selo&#39;s.<br/>
- Sneak up to the bros and Charm one.<br/>
- Assuming Charm sticks, the other will probably immediately attack it due<br/>
to its inheriting my factions, but if not, click on the other brother and<br/>
hit &quot;/pet attack&quot; hotkey.<br/>
- Click on original charmee.<br/>
- Start Selo&#39;s.<br/>
- Watch ensuing battle.<br/>
- When Charm breaks and brother runs toward me, hit Charm again.<br/>
- Assuming Charm sticks, the charmee *should* return to previous &quot;/pet<br/>
attack&quot; status.<br/>
- Repeat until one is dead.<br/>
- Once one is dead, the problem shifts to a kite or chain/fear issue to<br/>
finish survivor off.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried this.  Hell I can&#39;t even make this work with Orc Centurians in<br/>
East Commonlands.  Either I totally misunderstand something or I&#39;m just not<br/>
coordinated to pull it off.<br/>
