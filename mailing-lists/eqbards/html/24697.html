<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764597842">Last night I had a revelation -- I know the guilds of Xegony by thier <br/>
Bards. For example, last night in Hate, I was grouped with <br/>
a &quot;Darkfox&quot; and a &quot;Slyde&quot;... when ask about AD, my only comment <br/>
was, &quot;they have a SUPER nice bard by the name of Tawney.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I gotta get out more. *Grins*<br/>

Be well,<br/>
