<div id="ygrps-yiv-647358776">Hmmm - Bards complain publicly that certain Singing Armor pieces have never<br/>
dropped.  Lots of Bumps on the BBS.  No response from Verant; but one<br/>
assumes they saw the Thread.<br/>
<br/>
	A patch goes on the server.  THEN a Singing Breatplate is found on a<br/>
server.<br/>
<br/>
	Could this be coincidence?  Did they find an error in the Drop Tables and<br/>
secretly fix it?<br/>
<br/>
	We will never know for sure...<br/>
