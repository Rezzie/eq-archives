<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423575465">I&#39;ve heard about the ability to twist dischord, bellow, and dissonance<br/>
along with their respective instruments to actually do more damage than<br/>
I would with weapons. At level 20 this is not yet a viable option as<br/>
I&#39;ve never bothered to raise my brass skill above 25 (I&#39;m sure i could<br/>
bring it to master, though, in a few hours at the arena). Does anyone<br/>
have specific techniques or comments on this? (please don&#39;t say not to<br/>
do it in spawn areas...I know two of the songs are area effect)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
