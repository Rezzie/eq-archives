<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007773861">aye wouldn&#39;t that be great.  our sky trips cost upwards of 20k because of<br/>
summons.  it&#39;s great for latecomers to VS and Trak raids though, or even<br/>
just when you are with a mage deep inside sebilis and don&#39;t want to fight<br/>
out for replacements.  and gettiung stuck in gates lol.<br/>

&gt; 3rd which is costly to the people missing the initial gate up<br/>
