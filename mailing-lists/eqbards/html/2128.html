<div id="ygrps-yiv-591753771">Besides just focusing on one mob, it really pays off to focus<br/>
on the *strongest* mob first. There are alot of reasons for this<br/>
but in the case of lullaby it&#39;s more likely to work on the<br/>
weaker mobs and make them stand there waiting their turn to<br/>
get beat on. If your group is smart (or well informed by you -<br/>
I usually say inc and call first target when I&#39;m pulling), this<br/>
should let you control the fight very nicely. I&#39;m fighting<br/>
tougher stuff these days but many times I had a lizard defender<br/>
and maybe a couple warders sleeping away while we wailed on<br/>
the tougher sentinel in Cazic. Lullaby can turn an un-winnable<br/>
fight into a near cake walk if you have some luck on your side<br/>
and dont get too many resists.<br/>
