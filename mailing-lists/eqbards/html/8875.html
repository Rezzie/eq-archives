<div id="ygrps-yiv-425162731">Has anyone here killed deepwater goblins to get this helm?  If so, could you give me an idea of<br/>
the following:<br/>
<br/>
-  What zone is best for this?  Oasis or Lake Rathe?<br/>
-  What level were the goblins, or was the party you were with?<br/>
-  Was there a particular type of goblin that dropped the helm?<br/>
-  How frequent a drop was the helm?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>
