&gt;&gt;Not a bad idea, but 30-50% health would be better<br/>
&gt;&gt;in my personal opinion. 50 hp to a high level<br/>
&gt;&gt;player out of their total of over 1000 would<br/>
&gt;&gt;simply be unrealistic. But it&#39;s a good idea<br/>
&gt;&gt;all the same.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I would look at it as a you have just been revived off your deathbed and<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;full heal attack syndrome.  On a similar note, I feel when we die all<br/>
&gt;players should repop with zero mana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Boy would that make them cry.<br/>
