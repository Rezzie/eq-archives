<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614395289">ooh ok, i can&#39;t keep trackof all this info! =)<br/>
i thought someone selling one in karnor&#39;s told me that.<br/>
<br/>
so does the proc on the sabre still not work?  i agree with Gendal on the<br/>
dagger, i love tishan&#39;s clash.  as a wiz i used it a ton, sometimes i liked<br/>
stunning more than nuking.  but there are so many new graphics for weapons<br/>
out there, no reason ours shouldn&#39;t as well =/<br/>
