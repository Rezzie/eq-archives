<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618321443">his latest updates show that only the Johnathan&#39;s songs are having their<br/>
absorption removed, Niv&#39;s and Wee are remaining as they are.  and yes all 3<br/>
johnathan&#39;s songs will now be self-only.<br/>

&gt; OK, am I confused or did Twilight already work at any time of <br/>
&gt; day?  Also, I noticed that Caster&#39;s Realm says Twilight <br/>
&gt; pushes the mobs, rather than pulls them ;P.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And this means Jonthan&#39;s Provocation is now self-only, yes?<br/>
