<div id="ygrps-yiv-852256155">Why does it matter if people come in after your guild clears out fear?  Are<br/>
they hurting you in any way?<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, you say how much it stinks to break the plane (deaths and<br/>
time) but then criticze others for not wanting to do it themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Given:  Guild XYZ has broken Fear.  Guild ABC wants to hit fear later.<br/>
<br/>
Choice1: Go in when we&#39;re ready and kill stuff as it shows up.<br/>
<br/>
Choice2:  Wait till later then do the whole break thing our selves.<br/>
<br/>
If depends on what you want.  There is nothing wrong with either choice, its<br/>
just a different play style.</div>
