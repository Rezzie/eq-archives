<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509095778">I&#39;ve seen a 50 Necro with a 49 pet and a 50 cleric backing him up manage<br/>
to handle the frenzied spawn, after a very weak starting spawn so they<br/>
could get the split, but this combination....it must have been quite a<br/>
show. I&#39;ll fall into the very surprised catagory with Shada. :)<br/>
