<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047329609">Because Verant is evil.  There are loads of &#39;dumb&#39; things that they leave in<br/>
because they know that it will cause trouble (game dynamics, persona, people<br/>
factor, whatever).  Once you talk to Brad in person and see that maniac like<br/>
twinkle in his eyes, you will understand (he is evil too btw.)  Why do they<br/>
leave &quot;a&quot; as the default auto-attack key?  To help people do quests?  To<br/>
encourage them to &quot;hail&quot; npcs?<br/>

&gt; One thing I always thought was strange.  Why didn&#39;t Verant make corpse<br/>
&gt; dragging dependent on a different permission than looting? </span></blockquote></div>
