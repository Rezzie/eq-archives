<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1790676156">went with an enchanter friend to the arena last night and tested out the<br/>
effect of Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody. since it doesn&#39;t cancel magic, it<br/>
seemed likely that it would prevent bad effects (DoT and the like). from<br/>
what i could tell, it didn&#39;t do anything at all. he could still charm me,<br/>
and debuffs and DoT worked.<br/>
<br/>
it looks like another broken spell, unless anyone else has seen it<br/>
actually do something?<br/>
