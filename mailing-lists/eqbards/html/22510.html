I found this issue too and just petitioned first before I reported to see if it was some new known issue with the game.  When I told the GM if he ever wanted to get dizzy I&#39;d tell him how he laughed :)<br/>

Anyway this is the first time I have seen this issue but I a told it&#39;s an old bug.  Maybe something in the the patch has changed it in such a way that everything is all sensitive again?!<br/>
