<div id="ygrps-yiv-362603744">Hello,<br/>
I just subscribed to this list, but I was wondering if any of you<br/>
could reccomend a 1h slash weapon for a level 12 bard?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am in bronze armor now for the most part..and it seems a bit<br/>
heavy.  Whats the next step armor wise?<br/>
<br/>
thanks!</div>
