&gt; Hi there, I&#39;m Hire. 14th level bard on Vallon ZEK! I&#39;m nearing<br/>
&gt; the magical L17 and dual wield, and I&#39;m wondering what are the <br/>
&gt; most effective weapon? I was thinking of combine longswords <br/>
&gt; for a while, but it seems now-adays with my fine steel <br/>
&gt; longsword I&#39;m missing 2/3 of my swings anyway (exaggeration<br/>
&gt; alert!). Recently switched to a fine steel short and even <br/>
&gt; though I went from 12 dmg per round to 8, I&#39;m missing a lot<br/>
&gt; less. There is obviously a balance to be reached, so my question<br/>
&gt; is .. high delay : high damage? Or vice versa?<br/>

(i.e. camp a spot).  Use one weapon half the time, use the<br/>
other weapon half the time.  Parse your logfile and figure out<br/>
which one you do better with.<br/>
