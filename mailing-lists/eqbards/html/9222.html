<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028945462">i never even considered this.  i am absolutely ecstatic to have a full set<br/>
of imbrued (minus arms, have mithril vambraces).  the strength, charisma,<br/>
dexterity,a dn resistance bonuses of the major imbrued pieces far outweigh a<br/>
couple of AC points.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; So why<br/>
&gt; are bards penalized I ask?<br/>
&gt; I think there&#39;s a chance that an error was made. It seems the <br/>
&gt; ac on each<br/>
&gt; piece of our armor is the same of rangers/rogues who although <br/>
&gt; are melee<br/>
&gt; classes, they are also natural chain wearers, who were desgined by<br/>
&gt; Verant to have *less* ac than any type of plate-wearing class, not<br/>
&gt; *equal* ac. </span></blockquote></div>
