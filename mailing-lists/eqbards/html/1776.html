<div id="ygrps-yiv-566690780">As always, J.M Capozzi&#39;s advice is very sound.  One thing though, barbed leather<br/>
whips just cannot be bought for 50 plat anymore.  Neither can Polished Granite<br/>
Tomahawks for 250 plat (though that is closer to the market price).<br/>
<br/>
The general price that these are selling for on Karana is something like 100 to<br/>
150 for the whips, and 250 to 400 for the tomahawks.<br/>
<br/>
If you can find a lower price on your server, by all means, go for it. :)<br/>
