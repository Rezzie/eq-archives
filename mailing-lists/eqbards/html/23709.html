Damn lazy tanks. :p<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d prefer a higher aggro on mez as well.  I can take the hits after <br/>
mez is broken, I&#39;d like the Shaman to stay medding. Of course, if the <br/>
Bard is mezzing and the Enchanter is Slowing rather than a Shaman, <br/>
then the Chanter will still be beat on.  I think it&#39;s easier to let <br/>
the Enchanter mez, so he can properly prep the mob for the break if <br/>
need be.  (mem blur)<br/>
