&gt; Funny you should mention that.  I think the same bug is<br/>
&gt; affecting Lullaby.  Lullaby does not have a knockback<br/>
&gt; component so the &quot;stun&quot; effect is the only way it can<br/>
&gt; interrupt spells.  I&#39;ve seen a handful of cases the last week<br/>
&gt; where spellcasting mobs nodded, but successfully completed<br/>
&gt; their spells. <br/>

Lullaby on lizards in Cazic. Justicators got heals off, wraths off,<br/>
ever kind of spell, dispite supposedly being asleep.<br/>
