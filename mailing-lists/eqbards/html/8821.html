<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356055309">Hi everyone, this may well not be the appropriate forum for this, and if so, I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
While doing my own lambent quests, our group picked up extra components for both lambent boots and<br/>
lambent arms.  (Both are amazing items btw)<br/>
<br/>
If your group on Karana did something similar with other lambent items and you&#39;re interested in<br/>
trading, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, and also as a feeble attempt to make this more general-bard related.... while killing<br/>
hill giants to get lambent stones, my group was rather shocked to discover that killing two giants<br/>
was actually easier than killing one, thanks to Solon&#39;s Song of the Sirens.<br/>
<br/>
Except when a cyclops joined the fray as well.  :)<br/>
