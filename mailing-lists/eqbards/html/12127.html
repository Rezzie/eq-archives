and from the bat cave too? wow.&quot; But I have no Idea what you are talking<br/>
about, and If I don&#39;t then I&#39;m sure a lot of others don&#39;t too. Do you<br/>
mean a LOOONG way or just a little way? Can they track Bandl McMarrin<br/>
from Permafrost, or maybe just Captain silverwind from the bank in<br/>
Kelethin? Give us a scale to measure that you don&#39;t have to be 40th to<br/>
go by :)<br/>
