&gt;I still have a Dwarven Ringmail Tunic: (AC 12, +8 to heat, cold and magic<br/>
&gt;protection.) which frankly is still nice for pulling with it&#39;s resists..but<br/>
&gt;that AC hit is hurting...so, not having 1kpp for a Brigandine Tunic (and<br/>
&gt;however much for a Mithril) I am thinking Steel Breastplate (AC 17)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Steel Breastplate costs close to 1000pp in the stores.<br/>
:(<br/>
I thought 600. THen started actually pricing them. And they are WAY more<br/>
expensive.</div>
