<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115577275">I started a bard because I&#39;m a musician  -IRL.  When I first got EQ - I<br/>
played a Warrior for a few levels to learn the Interface with no intention<br/>
of it being my permanent char.  When I read up on the classes - I like the<br/>
musician angle (especially with the instruments).<br/>
As I got deeper in the game - I really enjoyed the class.  Being a support<br/>
char fits my personality.  The fact that I&#39;m an underused class leading to<br/>
invites on raids and such - and being the only bard in the guild (there was<br/>
another one for a while but he either quit or plays other chars in other<br/>
guilds not sure)<br/>
And if not for the last patch - I was starting to think things were actually<br/>
improving vis-├á-vis Verant&#39;s attitude towards us...<br/>
