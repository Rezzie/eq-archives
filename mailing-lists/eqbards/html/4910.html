<div id="ygrps-yiv-273772832">1) is your downstream 1MB, or is it 1MB down and up?  your upstream is very<br/>
important in EQ and all online games.  Make sure you have at least 256k<br/>
upstream.<br/>
 <br/>
2) you could play EQ 24/7 and never hit 20gb.  i play 16 hours a day<br/>
sometimes and maybe do 10 or 20mb of data transfer.  even if i am<br/>
underestimating, at 20GB a month you get over over 600mb a day.<br/>

<br/>
    Pardon for this being non-Bard oriented question (I forget the<br/>
terminology between META and OT - so forgive this as well) but given the<br/>
level of knowledge on this board - I wanted to ask it here..<br/>
 <br/>
I just signed up for DSL Access and hopefully will have 1.024 MBs access in<br/>
about five weeks.  Two questions<br/>
 <br/>
1) Will I see any advantages in EQ?  I would assume lag should be less of an<br/>
issue and zoning a bit faster...<br/>
 <br/>
2) The service I&#39;ve signed up for eventually will charge $20/GB upstream<br/>
after the first GB (i.e. the first Gigabyte is free) any idea how much data<br/>
EQ is pumping upstream?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks<br/>
