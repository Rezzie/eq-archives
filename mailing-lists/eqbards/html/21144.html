<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378655029">It all lies in what you want out of the game.  Unfortunatly in your (and I&#39;m<br/>
sure lots of people&#39;s, since I hear this all the time) veiw, what others<br/>
players have/do affect your enjoyment.  (And I don&#39;t mean directly as in<br/>
training half a dungeon on your head, but rather indirectly in that you want<br/>
to feel price in your accomplishments and feel your accomplisments are<br/>
lessened when others achieve them.)<br/>
<br/>
Other people have different veiws (in this case they just wish to have the<br/>
items/experience of being on the planes/whatever).<br/>
<br/>
The unfortunate part is their veiw conflicts with yours (and again, I dont<br/>
mean to point at YOU but rather you as a group who share similar veiws).<br/>
Theres not much that can be done about this, as both groups of people have<br/>
the right to play the game.  You (and your comrades) know how you got your<br/>
planar gear, let that be enough.</div>
