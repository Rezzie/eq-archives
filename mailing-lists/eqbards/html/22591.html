<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624976233">maybe it&#39;s not exactly 75%, or there is some rounding going on, but it is<br/>
between 75-80%, and does change as you level.  at 57 i get 120 MR from psalm<br/>
of mystic shielding with SSS, 67 without, which is a 79% increase.  Thott at<br/>
60 gets 126 MR with SSS.<br/>
<br/>
p.s. cleared VP again last night, killed Phara Dar for the second time.  and<br/>
though VI said they were not upgrading items or putting new loot in they<br/>
obviously changed their mind cause there is some incredible stuff in there<br/>
now, the caliber of items that should have always been in there and that we<br/>
expected.<br/>
