&gt;Okay, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve got so far.  Once again a reminder, I&#39;m not looking<br/>
&gt;to send in an email asking for new features added, just for fixes to current<br/>
&gt;problems, or at least estimates on when we can expect things to be fixed.  I<br/>
&gt;want answers, not changes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This all looks really good (although I&#39;ll stand by my belief in Forage not<br/>
being too low).  If no one has any oppositional posts by next week, I say<br/>
send it.<br/>
