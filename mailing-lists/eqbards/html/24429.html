&gt;slot?  I have one also, but mine only goes in the primary slot?<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m confused...is there more than one RBF?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nah, they all say primary only now, but go back in the range slot <br/>
just fine; I should know, I have been putting mine back about two <br/>
times a gaming session lately. *Grins*<br/>
