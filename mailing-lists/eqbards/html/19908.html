<div id="ygrps-yiv-701465935">I have<br/>
  basically<br/>
  moved to Kunark, going back to the mainland only to buy spells.<br/>
<br/>
  - *grin* I have set up &quot;shop&quot; down there too.  I need to go back to the<br/>
mainland and &quot;stock&quot; up on my songs for about the next 10 levels then put<br/>
them in the bank and merrily live in Kunark. I have food, water, and men!<br/>
What more does this little bard need?<br/>
<br/>
  Jacana, Wood Elf Bard, Innoruuk, Happily in Kunark and now the 18th song<br/>
<br/>
