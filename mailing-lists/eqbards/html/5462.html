<div id="ygrps-yiv-1977026690">Does it ever bother anyone else that people who say, &quot;Sorry if you couldn&#39;t<br/>
understand, English isn&#39;t my first language,&quot; often speak more coherently<br/>
than about 70 -80% of the people whose first language it is?  I mean, I meet<br/>
people who have been speaking English their entire lives, and I guess its<br/>
just degraded from over use.  For all of those people out there who think<br/>
they aren&#39;t being understood, don&#39;t worry about it, chances are you get your<br/>
points across more clearly than we naturals do :)<br/>
