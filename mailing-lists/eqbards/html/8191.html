<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344722946">Great Answers!  Thank you for posting.  I love to hear from you and from<br/>
everyone.  You may be one of the youngest but I think that _all_ bards need<br/>
to be young-at-heart!!<br/>
<br/>
Please post again and tell us about your adventures and feel free to ask for<br/>
tips when you get a new song.  If you play on the Innoruuk server,  please<br/>
send me a /tell I would love to hunt with you some time!<br/>
