<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In first person view the U key &quot;uses&quot; things, including doorknobs.  I&#39;ve<br/>
remapped mine to X, since my movement keys are ESF&C.<br/>

&gt; sometimes a problem for me also.....And is there no way to <br/>
&gt; switch items, like<br/>
&gt; weapons to instruments, with the keyboard? I&#39;d love to never <br/>
&gt; use my mouse!<br/>
