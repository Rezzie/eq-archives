<br/>
Has anyone else had a problem camping while playing a song?  I have<br/>
always camped while having Selo&#39;s playing up to now, but this morning<br/>
my camp was being interrupted right as the song pulse hit.  Maybe<br/>
another new thing out of the latest patch, not a big problem, just<br/>
curious ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Ah well, back to the groupies ........<br/>
