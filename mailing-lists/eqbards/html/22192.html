<div id="ygrps-yiv-1502980070">I just came across this thread in whineplay, which I think all of you should<br/>
take a look at.  Evidently there has been a change to the mechanics of bard<br/>
song on Test:<br/>

It appears that this change is to keep us from indefinitely playing a song<br/>
while AFK.  The message received is evidently &quot;Your song ends abruptly&quot;, and<br/>
has a chance of occuring on every pulse. Once again, Verant seems to be<br/>
putting the screws to us.  We can&#39;t take a break at all from the keyboard if<br/>
we want to keep two songs up, now I have to stay at the keyboard to keep one<br/>
song up as well.  I guess bards dont need bathroom breaks.<br/>
<br/>
All this will do is encourage more use of a macroed gamepad.<br/>
