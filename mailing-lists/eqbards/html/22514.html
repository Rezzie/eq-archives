<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; ROFL, EVERYTHING was messed up last night.. sounds were <br/>
&gt; distorted, health<br/>
&gt; bars showing 2% heath when you hadn&#39;t even taken a hit.. my <br/>
&gt; stomach even got<br/>
&gt; upset from the weird sounds... some people had gamma <br/>
&gt; problems, etc.  Hoping<br/>
&gt; that they fix this today<br/>
