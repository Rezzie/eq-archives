<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861018820">dont you guys use forage? i do it frequently and have a never ending supply<br/>
on food and water. food comes so pleny that i give it away to the poor<br/>
clerics that cry every time they have to relog because of a group bug or a<br/>
failed pull to clear hatelists ;) and all theis food is gone, hehe.<br/>
<br/>
as for the boots, a friend gave me a pair as a present, but at lvl 40 i<br/>
still cannot use the effect. but its a very good enhancement on the boots<br/>
and greaves, will make them even more valuable.<br/>

Summoning Food and Water 1 at a time was so painful, especially since it<br/>
takes away from /gems time. ;-p<br/>
