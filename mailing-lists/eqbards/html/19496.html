<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380544878">The new songs for hybrids referred to the Ranger hate lowering song I<br/>
believe.  Wasn&#39;t aware any other hybrids got more songs.  <br/>
<br/>
Gotta love that one.  They couldn&#39;t own up to the fact they screwed up by<br/>
not increasing the ranger defensive stats, so to save face they give Rangers<br/>
a spell to lower their hate list factor.  So much for Symphonic Harmony<br/>
being unique to bards.<br/>

Why is it, all it takes is a patch where they don&#39;t tell us things that we<br/>
instantly find out anyway, to make me cynical once again. <br/>
There was also some talk last night of new hybrid spells available from<br/>
vendors.  I checked our vendor in FV and no new songs.  I suppose I&#39;m not<br/>
being literal enough; I&#39;d be nuts to confuse songs with &#39;spells&#39;, right? ;)<br/>
