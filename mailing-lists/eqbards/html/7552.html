<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768509202"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; How about just having us re-pop with say 50HP<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not a bad idea, but 30-50% health would be better<br/>
in my personal opinion. 50 hp to a high level<br/>
player out of their total of over 1000 would<br/>
simply be unrealistic. But it&#39;s a good idea<br/>
all the same.</div>
