<div id="ygrps-yiv-716955898"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 1) When I&#39;m in a pickup group and we&#39;re camping a rare whatsit, I try and<br/>
&gt; defer looting to others, especially if there are obvious d00ds, powergames,<br/>
&gt; or hotheads in the group.  The possibility for contention is just too high<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s funny is that usually the folks that scream loudest about loot problems<br/>
are usually those who resort to these kind of tactics themselves (ninja<br/>
looting and the like).  They assume that because THEY are dishonest, everybody<br/>
else must be dishonest as well.</div>
