<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332197947"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 	Happily trotted into Rivervale, ah the wonders of halfling<br/>
&gt; civilization.  Rolled up to my friend Twippie and showed him the sword.<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s been kindly to me for almost as long as I can remember so he always<br/>
&gt; gives me great prices.  He took one look at the word and offered me 2.7pp.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Some merchants are just stingier than others and do not seem<br/>
&gt;to give you the best prices despite your faction.  Others will<br/>
&gt;give you the best prices even if they are indifferent to you<br/>
&gt;(if you have sufficient charisma).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s part of the weird part, Twippie definitely usually gives me the best<br/>
price, but occasionally he gives me bad prices, then next time I zone in the<br/>
prices are back to best again, all with no faction change.<br/>
