&gt; &gt; Which of the following skills do you use regularly?<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Forage, Sneak, Safe Fall,   Hide, Disarm Traps, Tracking, Pick Locks<br/>

&gt;You do realize people who aren&#39;t high enough level to have<br/>
&gt;some of these skills are going to say they don&#39;t use them<br/>
&gt;regularly?  Tracking is probably the most useful skill we get,<br/>
&gt;but it&#39;s a L35 skill so most people will say they won&#39;t use<br/>

point more.  By the time you get tracking, it&#39;s almost become a moot point <br/>
because 90% of the mobs you will want to attack are static mobs <br/>
*anyway*...  But in anycase, we&#39;ll see how the numbers work out.<br/>
