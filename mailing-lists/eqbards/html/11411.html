<div id="ygrps-yiv-748029952">For the most part on target in my opinion if a bit too pointed.  You are mistaken however about our ability to hit magic only creatures.  Magic gloves only started working as a magic attack for anyone other then monks about 4 patches ago IE about 2 months ago before that it was weapons or songs and that was the only damage you did.  Now if we have a magic instrument or gloves we can punch magic only for damage while using the instrument.<br/>
