First you use Locating Lyric like you normally do.  It&#39;ll<br/>
point you in the direction of the corpse, but more<br/>
importantly, it&#39;ll make the corpse your current target.<br/>
<br/>
Next you use Solidarity of Vision (L34) to bind sight to the<br/>
corpse.  Switch to an external camera view, rotate around, and<br/>
usually you can tell from the surroundings exactly where the<br/>
corpse is.  VERY useful for finding corpses in dangerous<br/>
sections of a dungeon, or if the corpse isn&#39;t where the person<br/>
thinks he died.<br/>
