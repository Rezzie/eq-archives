p.s. looking for something to solo now that Avo&#39;s are green?  Try Goblin<br/>
Netmasters in Lake Rathe.  Giving xp at level 43.  Track them from the Flame<br/>
Tower Island. What no fishbone earring? Tsk, tsk, stock up on endure breath<br/>
potion or fishscales and beg your friendly ranger druids.  Nasty casters,<br/>
shallow water swimmers. After getting run out of the water a couple times<br/>
because the pally I was helping get his quest junk could not keep up with<br/>
the fight, DUH chain & fear work good!  Keep a DD spell handy too.  Melee<br/>
combat is difficult in the water.</div>
