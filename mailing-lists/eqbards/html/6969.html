Here is some information you might find interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Whilst there is no cap on the benefit of a statistic being over 200, the <br/>
extra benefit you get above this amount is very little. This means that if <br/>
you have 210 intelligence and only 90 dex, you would probably be better off <br/>
to go back to 200 int and have 100 dex.<br/>
It is not the case that you get no extra mana from having 230 int as <br/>
compared with 200 int, but it is a great deal less than you would get from <br/>
having an increase of say 170 int to 200 int.<br/>
