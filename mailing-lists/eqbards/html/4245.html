&gt;         Hi all.  My bard is a follower of Bristlebane, and I&#39;ve been hoping to find<br/>
&gt; a temple or shrine to him, so that I can make a journey there in game<br/>
&gt; sometime, but I&#39;m at a loss.  Does anyone know if there are any temples or<br/>
&gt; shrines to Bristlebane?  I fear it may be in one of the evil cities, that I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t visited yet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The halfling clerics of Rivervale all worship Bristlebane.  There isn&#39;t a shrine to him<br/>
per se, but that&#39;s where he&#39;s the center of the universe.  :)<br/>
