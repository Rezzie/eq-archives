<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866847917">I made the mail run from Qeynos to HPH then ran the mail back to Qeynos last<br/>
night.  I didn&#39;t pay attention to the gold I got for the Q-HPH run (forgot<br/>
to check while looking at the faction adj.), but I made 10gp on the HPH-Q<br/>
run! (plus exp @ lvl 18)<br/>
Interesting note on factions... shouldn&#39;t we get a faction bonus from the<br/>
merchants/citizens and guards of the city we&#39;re delivering to?  Just a<br/>
though...<br/>
