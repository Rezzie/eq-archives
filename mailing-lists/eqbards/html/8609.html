<div id="ygrps-yiv-942090509">When I did mine, I was too antsy to actually stay afk for very long. So, I<br/>
would pop back about every 20 minutes and check things.  Here is something I<br/>
think I saw.  I would get 2 and 3 skill check or advance messages right<br/>
after starting the song.  Then non for very long time.  But a quick 2 may be<br/>
3 each time I stopped and restarted the song. <br/>

		4.  If you play DDD with a brass instrument for oh, say, 30<br/>
minutes (5 should do it) <br/>
		and get no skill increases, you should /petition.  You have<br/>
a problem.</div>
