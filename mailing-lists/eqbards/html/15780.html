<div id="ygrps-yiv-690283425">The best method that I have learned for lava corpse recoveries is Don&#39;t Fall <br/>
In!<br/>
<br/>
Of course it&#39;s not always as easy as all that, so there&#39;s a little trick you <br/>
can do when you fall into lava (at least by the Lavastorm entrance of Sol A, <br/>
haven&#39;t tried it in any of the other lava, but may work).<br/>
<br/>
/quit<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that&#39;s right, /quit, or /q for short.<br/>
<br/>
When you log back in, you should be back on land and alive.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m not saying that this will always work in every lava pool you come <br/>
across, but it has saved my blue butt more times than one, and I teach it to <br/>
every person I group with that doesn&#39;t have much Sol A experience.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps...<br/>
