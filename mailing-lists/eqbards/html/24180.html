<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026441170">it works out the same anyway.  generally, you lose 1/2 bubb in a normal<br/>
level, 1/4 buub in 30 and exp takes twice as much to gain back, 1 full bubb<br/>
in 31 but exp takes half as much to gain back.  in all 3 situations, death<br/>
is the same penalty.  this was pre-exp changes, i dunno if it still applies.<br/>
i haven&#39;t had an unressed death since Kunark opened.<br/>

&gt; In hell levels, the exp you lose from dying is barely <br/>
&gt; noticable.. but in the<br/>
&gt; level afterwards, you stand to lose a bubble of exp (yellow) with each<br/>
&gt; death. </span></blockquote></div>
