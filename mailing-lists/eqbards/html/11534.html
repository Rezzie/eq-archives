<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768598300">Dirge rocks in duels.  Especially against paladins that like to wait til the<br/>
last minute before they resort to lay on hands :)<br/>

bards are great against casters, poor against melee.  i win almost all of my<br/>
duels against casters, but have not won against melee yet.  i try not to<br/>
employ tactics such as kiting or fear/chain in duels, just to be more<br/>
challenging.  i fought 2 level 50 rangers 3 times.  the 1st ranger times i<br/>
got him to about 35-40% health both times and died, once with weapons and<br/>
once with lute only.  the 2nd ranger i got to 21hp with lute only, have not<br/>
tried her with weapons and different song strategies.  i wanna try again.<br/>
btw, my favorite part of any duel is dirge.  love that 325 nuke to change<br/>
the tide of the fight.<br/>
