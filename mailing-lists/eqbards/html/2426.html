<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032685704">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in finding out whether or not Clarity can be twisted with<br/>
other songs.  This is rather hard to do since Clarity does not leave an<br/>
icon like most of our other songs.  I am also dying to find out if Clarity<br/>
and be twisted with Jig to give us a nice 250% mana regen bonus :)<br/>
I will be doing some research on this tonight, I&#39;m asking all other mid<br/>
level bards (32+) to please do the same and let us start our research.  By<br/>
the way, if JM is reading this, please let us know if the Jig&#39;s mini<br/>
mana regen effect is a bug.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
