Can a warrior, ranger, paladin, or monk stand toe to toe with a hill giant<br/>
and win?  so far i have only just begun the investigation.  I already have<br/>
one account of a warrior soloing a Hill Giant in North Karana, though since<br/>
this was only hearsay the search for the truth continues.  I will keep you<br/>
updated.<br/>
