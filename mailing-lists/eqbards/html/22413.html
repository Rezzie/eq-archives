<div id="ygrps-yiv-654818114">I know the feeling Elfson,  seems more and more of us drop like flies, fewer and fewer old faces.  But you beat the odds of the addiction so be happy (kidding) I&#39;m sorry to see you go.  Forgive the non eq topic but there is another game I&#39;ve seen &quot;darkage of camelot&quot; which will have bards so I have not yet lost all hope of finding some of you all again should we all choose to depart.</div>
