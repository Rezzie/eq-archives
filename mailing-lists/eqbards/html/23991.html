&gt;30, I&#39;d love to group.  I&#39;ve always wanted to have another bard <br/>
&gt;in the group that knew enough about the songs and how to twist <br/>
&gt;to coordinate a 6 song crescendo of power that NONE CAN<br/>
&gt;WITHSTAND..MWHAHAHAHAA!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think Dark may be level 32 now, yes? *Smiles*<br/>
<br/>
Actually, if I remember correctly, Dark is a couple of levels ahead <br/>
of me, so I would guess about 56 now.<br/>
<br/>
If you see me online, Atonal, feel free to give me a /tell.<br/>
<br/>
Be well,<br/>
