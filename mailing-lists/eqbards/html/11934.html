&gt; I at first thought DT&#39;s where pretty stupid too, but if you read my<br/>
&gt; previous post, i think they where put in for a good reason, and all in all,<br/>
&gt; it even makes sense. Armed with this knowledge, we cleared the pof and only<br/>
&gt; had to camp out twice from DT&#39;s... where as before we where basically<br/>
&gt; getting the dt&#39;s 75% of the time. <br/>
