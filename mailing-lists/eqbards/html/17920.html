<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419778039">I traded some Bladed Thulian Claws for my Drums, at a time when the<br/>
Claws were going for 800-900 (I bought them for 250 from an awesome<br/>
cleric in Cazic one night).  I still see people selling them for that<br/>
much or more, but not very often...in fact, I don&#39;t see them for sale<br/>
very often.<br/>
