<div id="ygrps-yiv-544660737">Earlier tongiht I was hunting with a druid friend in Permafrost.  We got in<br/>
to a bit of trouble so we took off to the zone.  When I hit the zone, I went<br/>
through the whole<br/>
LOADING<br/>
process, but wound up BACK in Permafrost (at the first corner where the 3<br/>
gobbies spawn) and at almost full health (I went in with less than a bubble,<br/>
and came back with only 1 bubble gone).  I&#39;m not complaining or anything,<br/>
but has anyone else noticed this or is it just on The Rathe?<br/>
