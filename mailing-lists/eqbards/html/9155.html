<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713711681">Actually, take out a ruler and measure it, the last bubble appears to be<br/>
harder because it is slightly larger than the middle bubbles (this is also<br/>
why the first bubble is harder too!).  You get the same exp for the same<br/>
kills, you just have a bigger bubble to fill to get to the next level. WOO<br/>
HOO! More monsters to slay!<br/>
