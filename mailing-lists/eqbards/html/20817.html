I&#39;m not sure how hard the COM coin is to get, but you can get the Dalnir,<br/>
Kaesora and Overthere coin at 37.  The lake coin is easy to get from anyone<br/>
camping the goblins (they drop them all the time) and the Emerald Jungle<br/>
coin is foraged, so you&#39;ll need a ranger or druid to help...</div>
