<div id="ygrps-yiv-686154203"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; When Gordon says that some of the new mobs will make Vox/Nag look like lawn<br/>
&gt; trash you bet we need better songs.   When many of the other classes are<br/>
&gt; getting group buffing spells our songs need to keep pace with this power up.<br/>
&gt; Many of the classes are getting insta-kill spells at 60th (Wizards:<br/>
&gt; Distentagrate.  Necros/Clerics: Banish Undead, Magicians: Banish Summoned)<br/>
&gt; This is the level of power 60th lvl groups will have.  Makes me think I<br/>
&gt; undershoot on my song ideas.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Set your ideas to the level of a 12yr old GM.  Insta-kill?<br/>
  Deathtouch?  What every happened to skill based playing ;p<br/>
  <br/>
  They can&#39;t up the hp anymore, so now be looking for extreme<br/>
  damage factors.  Since NPCs never really casted with intelligence,<br/>
  I would expect more instakill type mobs.  Hell if Verant can&#39;t<br/>
  make their AI very good, they can just add:<br/>
 <br/>
  player-&gt;set_hp(- player-&gt;query_hp())  that always works at making<br/>
                                        an NPC win. (ala 12yr tactics)<br/>

  mob-&gt;say(player-&gt;name + &quot;!&quot;)<br/>

  haha, HARMONIC! argh...<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
