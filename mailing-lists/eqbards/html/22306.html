<div id="ygrps-yiv-827660869">For the past few weeks I have noticed when I was using Pixie strike to<br/>
interrupt casters that I was actually mezzing them and I did not see<br/>
secondary resists.  I havent been in a situation where i needed to do crowd<br/>
control (except Frost Giants, and ya cant mezz them so I used charm), so I<br/>
have not taken the time to investigate this further.<br/>
<br/>
I am of the opinion that many of our complaints are being heard, and they<br/>
are being stealth fixed in the background.<br/>
