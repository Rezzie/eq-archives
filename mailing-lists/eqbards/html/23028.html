<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065957102">well don&#39;t forget i was level 50 forever before kunark came out, that&#39;s a<br/>
lot of days there.  and being in a guild that does mostly raids is lots of<br/>
time and a big hurt on the exp bar.  50 is as easy as any other level, but<br/>
51 and 52 are no picnic when you first experience them.<br/>
