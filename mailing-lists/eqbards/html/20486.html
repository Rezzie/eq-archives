<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067618918">I very rarely use Pixie Strike to mez, so I can&#39;t comment on the secondary<br/>
resists (though I have been getting those messages for a while I think).  I<br/>
only use the spell to stun casters (my small guild has 4 enchanters at my<br/>
level range so I am rarely without one).<br/>
<br/>
The song is still very effective at stopping casters, however.</div>
