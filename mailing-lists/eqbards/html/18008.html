<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-393480122">I tried out my mez song for the first time in the maze fighting minos and<br/>
them damn mud things. Well any ways. As soon as I got they blink message I<br/>
got it has woren off. My cha is 106, and so level I am I thought that was<br/>
good. So I was wondering do I have to use strings with the song to make it<br/>
work? Or dose this song just bite?!?!?<br/>
<br/>
If any one has some info they wish to part on this matter please do! :)<br/>
thanks a bunch<br/>
