<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1868466915">While grouped with a druid friend of mine tonight, I had SoW cast on me.  <br/>
While SoW was still in effect, I tried to start up Selo&#39;s Accelerando and <br/>
got no text messages at all, and no song sprites.<br/>
<br/>
Apparently in removing Selo&#39;s ability to &quot;break&quot; SoW the gods have decided <br/>
that SoW will override Selo&#39;s, and thus if you have SoW up you cannot even <br/>
perform Selo&#39;s Accelerando.  As Athren Notechaser experienced (and reported <br/>
on this list) this also means that if you have SoW up and are rooted, you <br/>
cannot break the root with Selo&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
The next obvious question is, will Selo&#39;s still break roots when there&#39;s no <br/>
SoW?  Anyone who has done so since the patch, please reassure me on this... <br/>
