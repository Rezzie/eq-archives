&gt; does anyone know if we can do the freeport corrupt guard quest with the<br/>
&gt; charismatic carillion song???<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; if so is it worth doing???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Assuming we don&#39;t get instantly killed before we sing the carillion son, I<br/>
think we can do pretty much any quest now.  I have done the Sentry Xyrinn<br/>
quest with it, and it&#39;s related to the corrupt guard one, so I&#39;m pretty sure<br/>
you could.<br/>
<br/>
As to whether it&#39;s worth it, I can&#39;t say.  I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s a good quest<br/>
though.<br/>
