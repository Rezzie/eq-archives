<div id="ygrps-yiv-157993628">Do you mean that now only a halfling can complete the quest and get the<br/>
reward or is the cap now only wearable by a halfling?  If its the second<br/>
option, the non-halflings who already have one are getting hosed.<br/>

&gt; has<br/>
&gt; replaced the blackened as a reward for the ogre heads quest in BB/Kaladim,<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; hear that the raider cap is now Halfling only.<br/>
