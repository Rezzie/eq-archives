&gt; Let&#39;s put this into perspective...<br/>
&gt; Bard drum graphic - &quot;Too large for a patch&quot;<br/>
&gt; Barb shield graphic - ditto<br/>
&gt; Ranger&#39;s Short Sword of Morin - In there bay-beeee!  (and yes, that was well<br/>
&gt; AFTER Beta)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not to defend Verant, but I think the difference is the changes to the<br/>
model needed, not the actual graphic, so a sword would be easy because<br/>
the attachment point for a sword is already there, just the coordinates<br/>
needed to draw a new model are different. Plus, are you sure the graphic<br/>
wasn&#39;t in there already? The guy working on the eq emulator released<br/>
some screenshots where he created an army with each human holding a<br/>
different weapon and there&#39;s a ton of weapon designs in there that<br/>
haven&#39;t been used yet.<br/>
