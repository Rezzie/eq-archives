<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646424829">Your health might have contributed, &#39;cause this guy doesn&#39;t outrun<br/>
everything.  I can overtake him pretty handily with 200 percussion and<br/>
Mistmoore Drums.  I think the only common mobs that can outrun me now are<br/>
Shadowmen and perhaps Grimfeather, but if I recall correctly from this list<br/>
I&#39;m slightly faster than the uber-Griff now.<br/>

&gt; 1/2 health when I started running (in about 2 seconds).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Was pretty funny- glad my friendly neighborhood cleric was there!<br/>
