<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-501555722">after the patch other day i tried to dispell clarity on me and couldnt..<br/>
(damn chanters sometimes)<br/>
<br/>
Now in the past the only thing i used to dispel on myself was dark elf<br/>
illusion...  Were we able to dispell our buffs in the past with our song?<br/>
or has this changed since last patch?  I could not dispell clarity, i tried<br/>
multiple times, morphed into DE form, was able to dispell that.<br/>
<br/>
Just curious<br/>
