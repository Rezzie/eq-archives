<div id="ygrps-yiv-533129726">I think Cloak of Flames is 30% as well, but umm, it&#39;s off a dragon<br/>
(Nagafen), not a frog that a shaman or necro can solo as Shada points<br/>
out. ;P<br/>

&gt; i am so bored at work i am surfing the ebay auctions.  i think the<br/>
&gt; salesmanship is hilarious, how almost all items are touted as the best<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; their effects completely exaggerated.  two that just made me laugh was<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; mistmoore battle drums increase songs by 30% (more like 16% by<br/>
&gt; Maravana&#39;s<br/>
&gt; numbers, and widely believed to be no more than 20%) and the haste<br/>
&gt; sash<br/>
&gt; increasing attack speed by 30% (more like 15%, the best warrior sword<br/>
&gt; in the<br/>
&gt; game off Innoruuk is 30%).  anyway, just a comment.<br/>
