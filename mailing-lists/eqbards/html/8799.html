<div id="ygrps-yiv-816832261">I did the hero bracer quest a couple days ago, it was very simple.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have the shackles, go under the arena in south qeynos and talk<br/>
to Rothkar. Say &quot;what about the second escaped gladiator?&quot; for him to<br/>
talk about the mino hero. If your faction is bad he&#39;ll say you haven&#39;t<br/>
proven yourself. If so, play the lvl 11 faction song on him and problem<br/>
solved. Give him the shackles and you get the bracer placed in your<br/>
inventory.</div>
