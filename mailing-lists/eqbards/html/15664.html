<div id="ygrps-yiv-154825570">TOtally non bardish, but you people seem to know everything.  I got a<br/>
new computer (woohoo!)  What is the best way to move EQ over to it?  I<br/>
assume I will have to reinstall and wait about 10 hours getting<br/>
patched...  Are there any files I should copy over?<br/>
