<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554431263">Thanks to all you higher lvl bards for your imput regarding &quot;Will the Bard get Better&quot;  I&#39;m not as frustrated now because I&quot;VE LVLED, hehe.  You guys were right after lvl 17 things do move faster.  The tips on getting a lighter faster weapon has been a lifesaver.  I hated it but i traded in my mino axe.  (hehe, i liked so much seeing that 17 points of damage scroll across the screen)  However in the long run the change has paid off.  Thanks Again for all your help..<br/>
<br/>
Now i have another question.  I&#39;m interested in joining a good guild, emphasis on the good.  A bard guild would be nice or a guild that is very active on my server, which is by the way Innoruk.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Again<br/>
