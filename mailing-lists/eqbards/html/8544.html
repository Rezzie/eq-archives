<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727998407">They also have an item that does Full exp rezzes.  Most all guide powers are <br/>
item driven.  I think its the cloak that does it, but i am not certain.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Well this is wrong from first hand experiance. After the first zone crash<br/>
&gt; in the Plane of Fear (full spawn eeek!) we had a guide helping us by<br/>
&gt; ressurecting and recovering our corpses for us. He would summon us to our<br/>
&gt; corpse in the PoF and then do a ressurection. I thought this was damn odd,<br/>
&gt; because he was a lvl 50 cleric guide and was using his lvl 49 spell to do<br/>
&gt; this. And he had to meditate after each time. I have been ressurected<br/>
&gt; before by our GM and he didnt med or cast, just zapped away. Maybe this<br/>
&gt; was just a freak occurance, i dont know, but he definately had his spells<br/>
