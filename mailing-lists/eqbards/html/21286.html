<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565209413"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So, I ask Verant.  What IS the role of a bard?  Please help clear up <br/>
&gt;this disparity and tell us how YOU see us using our songs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Rosha Cristi, Bard of 51 {insert something musical here}<br/>
&gt;Guild Leader, Legends<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Apparently the role of a bard is to be support for the real characters in<br/>
the game, the casters.  I think Verant is totally convinced that the<br/>
original edition of Ars Magica was the perfect system.  Someone in a group<br/>
plays a mage and everyone else plays one of their henchmen.<br/>
