<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-441818309">My guild is planning to try the Anzarak (sp?) Island on Saturday.  Heh, 9<br/>
red to 50 mobs go agro... we&#39;ll see how it turns out.  My one other trip<br/>
there involved killing the fairies on the first island.  There&#39;s a lot of<br/>
crazy loots and some of them are mentioned in the bard quests.  Has anyone<br/>
done any of the quests?  I presume that you kill stuff, loot for your quest<br/>
items and then somehow make your way back to the first island and then the<br/>
quest temple to turn in the items.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone ever do any PoA quests?<br/>
