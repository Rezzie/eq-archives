<div id="ygrps-yiv-2092444201"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I keep hearing this and hopefully this will make you all realize that the<br/>
&gt; see invis song is still useful. Clouding only gives party see invis. In<br/>
&gt; other words, the only invis you can see are the members of your party that<br/>
&gt; you have invissed. You do not see all invisible creatures and players, only<br/>
&gt; those in your party.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not my experience.  This weekend, in Kedge, I used Sonorous Clouding<br/>
to see someone who was invis, but not in my party.<br/>
