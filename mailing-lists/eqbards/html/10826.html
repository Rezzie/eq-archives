<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279172704">I have seen a couple of comments on how hard Icy Greaves are to get.<br/>
This example matches my own experience, that they were easy.<br/>
<br/>
I went to king room twice. Once there was a group there i asked about<br/>
looting icy greaves, they said they needed 4 pair (no bards in group...<br/>
go figure). That night I returned and got in a group camping king room,<br/>
they had cleared the room, next round (2nd or 3rd elite) I got greaves.<br/>
<br/>
If you decide to go to the room invis, beware, the Goblin Wizard can see<br/>
invis.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; So far the longest I&#39;ve specifically camped an item was the icy greaves. <br/>
&gt; That took 2 and a half hours.  So far my cleric has spent at least 4 hours <br/>
&gt; on each of the items required for his armor.  I don&#39;t envy the clerics for <br/>
&gt; this quest, that&#39;s for sure. </span></blockquote></div>
