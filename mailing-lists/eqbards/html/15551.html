<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676548987">Oh sure..  I use Binding in Lower Guk routinely now.  That used to be<br/>
suicidal.  I&#39;d still be really careful inside Castle Mistmoore or right near<br/>
the zone into Lesser Faydark.  The mobs in the castle aren&#39;t routinely<br/>
camped like Sol B and Lower Guk<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; With overcrowding a problem on almost every server, I&#39;m wondering if it is<br/>
&gt; now safe to add these songs back to our playlist.  Months ago when<br/>
&gt; overcrowding wasn&#39;t as big a problem, singing AE songs in a<br/>
&gt; dungeon zone was<br/>
&gt; suicide because you were likely to start a massive train due to the z-axis<br/>
&gt; bug.  Nowadays, mobs in zones like LGuk are pulled usually within seconds<br/>
&gt; after they spawn.<br/>
