<div id="ygrps-yiv-179198883">I got to group with my L29 enchanter friend again last night,<br/>
and we made a couple discoveries.<br/>
<br/>
Charm does not cancel mesmerize.  If you use Sirens on a<br/>
target the enchanter has mesmerized, you end up with a<br/>
mesmerized pet - it stands there looking dumb :-), and won&#39;t<br/>
respond to commands.<br/>
<br/>
Lullaby overrides mesmerize (and I assume the higher level<br/>
version like enthrall).  Mesmerize normally lasts about 30<br/>
seconds, but if I hit the mesmerized target with Lullaby, it<br/>
would &quot;wake up&quot; after the Lullaby sleep period (0-3 pulses)<br/>
was over.  The higher level mesmerize variants can last as<br/>
long as 2 minutes, so this is definitely something you&#39;ll want<br/>
to be careful with.<br/>
