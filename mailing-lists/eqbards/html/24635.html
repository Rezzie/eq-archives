What about the CASSINDRA&#39;s CHANT of CLARITY song (songs) at 20 and 32 ?<br/>
Are they the same ?  Guess I need to check the vendors to see if there<br/>
even is a 32 clarity song around anymore :) Heheh, I love Bards so much<br/>
I have started a second with Much higher CHA than my first started 2<br/>
years ago and she is now at the age when these questions are first<br/>
coming to mind. Guess I know the answer to this one.<br/>
