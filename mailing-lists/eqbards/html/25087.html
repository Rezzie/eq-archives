<div id="ygrps-yiv-124553895">Just to clarify, the vast majority of these machines are built by the person<br/>
doing the overclocking.  These are not pre-built machines, eg: Not Gateway,<br/>
Dell, etc.  These processors are going from factory, to vendor, to user.  :)<br/>

Nah, more bang for the buck...consider also, any pc builder worth their salt<br/>
will have filtered the bad processors out before you ever get to see the<br/>
machines, i.e. doa rate and failure rate are gonna be much lower than the<br/>
builders.</div>
