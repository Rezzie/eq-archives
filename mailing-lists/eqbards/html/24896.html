gain by killing Goblins, Mooto and Deathfist Orcs; and by turning belts in <br/>
to Deputy Budo, and goblin warbeads in to Sheriff Roglio.  My Halfling <br/>
Druid (who STARTED amiable) took weeks to complete it.  Talies, on the <br/>
other hand, has a looong way to go.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, the ring is a one-shot Healing (100 hp), so really it&#39;s an <br/>
emergency-only toy for lower levels.<br/>
<br/>
The ring can be &quot;recharged&quot; by giving it to Hendi Mrubble in the Cleric&#39;s <br/>
Guild in Rivervale, but you have to have even MORE ungodly faction to do that.<br/>
