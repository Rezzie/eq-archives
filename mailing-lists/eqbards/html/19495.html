future expansion?  Until, of course, Gordon admitted that they&#39;d run out of<br/>

<br/>
There was also some talk last night of new hybrid spells available from<br/>
vendors.  I checked our vendor in FV and no new songs.  I suppose I&#39;m not<br/>
being literal enough; I&#39;d be nuts to confuse songs with &#39;spells&#39;, right? ;)<br/>
