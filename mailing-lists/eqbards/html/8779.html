<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054007861">It&#39;s found in Unrest, off the Lesser Blade Fiend (thus far, my favorite<br/>
mob with regards to looks: picture a rock dervish with weapons instead of<br/>
stones).  The spawn is supposedly rare in itself, with the Gladius being<br/>
the rare drop.  I&#39;ve heard rumor it comes from the basement, but it was<br/>
blue to me somewhere in my high teens.<br/>
