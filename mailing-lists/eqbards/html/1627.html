<div id="ygrps-yiv-333173159">Nafai has written up a very nice petition about a lot of the bards&#39;<br/>
problems in the game.  The petition is in the format of a topic and a<br/>
chance for you to agree/disagree with that particular topic.  I<br/>
encourage all bards to read it and give feedback.<br/>
