<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651497101">Last night I was testing around with my song and I found that the lv1 song<br/>
is awesome.  I stop using this song after lvl 7.  I am currently lvl 18.<br/>
When I twist the chant with lvl 7 song my attack went up by 20 (not dmg) and<br/>
my ac went up by 6 and str and dex too.  When I tested this out with a orc<br/>
warrior last night when I was lvl 17 it was very red to me.  It used to be<br/>
that a orc would do like 40 dmg per hit but with these 2 songs combine it<br/>
was doing like 2 -10 dmg per swing to me.  Sometime a 40 dmg but very rare.<br/>
it is just too bad that it is red to me that my piercing cannot do that much<br/>
dmg too it.  I like other plp,  just start to realized how cool the new dirk<br/>
is.  I can hit 3 or four times per tick with a dirk in primary and a combine<br/>
ls in secondary when playing the 2 songs mention above.  Now I twist the<br/>
chant then Warsong then the Bellow.  This is so cool.  I loved the bard.  It<br/>
is the most fun class.<br/>
