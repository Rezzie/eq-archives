&gt; &gt; Not a bad idea, but 30-50% health would be better<br/>
&gt; &gt; in my personal opinion. 50 hp to a high level<br/>

&gt; &gt; simply be unrealistic. But it&#39;s a good idea<br/>
&gt; &gt; all the same.<br/>

&gt;50 hp would certainly make casters think twice about binding<br/>
&gt;outside of city zones.  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How is this for a compromise.  When you respawn you have the current rez <br/>
effect, plus you only have 10% of your max HPs.  Then change the binding <br/>
rules to allow casters to bind anyone, anywhere (with a yes/no box).  I feel <br/>
this would balance the risk/reward factor, and make it so people could not <br/>
use suicide binding tactics when fighting Dragons and such.<br/>
