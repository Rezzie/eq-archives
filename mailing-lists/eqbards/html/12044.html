  I tell them to sit their ass down.  They have no business<br/>
  swinging for an average 10dmg per round.  More often than <br/>
  not, I dont have every buff or am completely healed, so I&#39;d<br/>
  rather them perform the job we hired them for then attempt <br/>
  to melee.  In my own immortal words:<br/>
<br/>
  If you hate sitting down so much, then you picked the wrong class =)<br/>
<br/>
  As for pretending to melee, I do on occasion outdmg rangers and<br/>
  paladins.  Double Yks with 205 DEX and SLTW and I almost<br/>
  always outdmg them.  Don&#39;t underestimate our melee potential.<br/>
  We are by no means the best, but we contribute easily 25% of<br/>
  melee damage in most battles (when properly equiped, assuming<br/>
  three tanks, three casters).<br/>
