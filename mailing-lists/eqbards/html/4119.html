<div id="ygrps-yiv-271437776">I have a question.  I am currently lvl 25 and the 3 songs that I twist when<br/>
I am in a group in High Keep are Anthem, Psalm of Warmth, and healing.  I am<br/>
usually group with people who are lvl 28-33 in there killing raiders and<br/>
warriors (non-magic users).  I cannot think of any other song in my<br/>
inventory that I can used except for these 3.  Any other song has no effect<br/>
on them.  Since these post mention that a lvl 20 playing a hymn song is sad<br/>
can you all tell me what other song that I can play to improve my group?  I<br/>
think the song that a bard use depends on the situation.  That is one of the<br/>
unique thing about being a bard.<br/>
<br/>
Thnx for all the info,<br/>
