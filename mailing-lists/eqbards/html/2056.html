<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026868023">How are you people using the charismatic carillion?  I have never had it do <br/>
anything for me.  After reading all these messages I thought maybe it had <br/>
been fixed, so I tried it on a merchant in Oasis of Mar who conned dubious <br/>
and refused to sell to me.  I equipped my mino horn, targeted the merchant, <br/>
played the carillion, and conned her again.  Still dubious.  Right clicked <br/>
her, she still refused to sell to me.<br/>

I am level 35 with wind skill either maxed out or close to it.<br/>
