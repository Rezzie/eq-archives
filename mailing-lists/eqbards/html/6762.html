<div id="ygrps-yiv-525033665">It works by temporarily raising you faction with the mob type selected.<br/>
That&#39;s why playing it more that once doesn&#39;t do anything, however this begs<br/>
the question if you do it to several different factioned mobs do you become<br/>
Mr. Popularity (e.g., EmeraldWarriors)?  I haven&#39;t experimented with it<br/>
really, but I&#39;m hoping someone else maybe knows.<br/>
<br/>
And... I&#39;ve been playing with CoD/Hymn for wisp slaying.  If I&#39;m reading<br/>
right, CoD is considered to be a DoT - if that&#39;s the case, how long does it<br/>
last?  What I&#39;ve been doing is wince... wounds... wounds... repeat.  Almost<br/>
sounds like directions for a shampoo. :)<br/>
<br/>
Lastly... Crookstinger: what poison does it affect with and where can you<br/>
get it?  I LOVE weapons that proc even if they aren&#39;t that great, like the<br/>
tent whip, since I&#39;m finding myself twisting songs and instruments far more<br/>
than melee&#39;ing in a (good) group.  At least I never have to yell OOM.<br/>
<br/>
