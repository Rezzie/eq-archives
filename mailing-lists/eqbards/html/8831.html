 </span></blockquote>Well, I don&#39;t know in what way you mean that it is broken, but I used it EXTENSIVELY since the<br/>
patch to interrupt spellcasters in Solusek A, and it worked perfectly.  I was not using it to<br/>
mezmerize something for a long period of time, its common other usage, so it may in fact be<br/>
broken in that way.<br/>
<br/>
It is definately stunning long enough to disrupt caster mobs though, an essential use if you&#39;re<br/>
camping Solusek Mages for their booties.<br/>
