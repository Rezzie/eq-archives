<b>Subject:</b> Grinnenne charm or Griffene charm for Lambent bracers? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081049891">I just killed a griffene in NK, while kinda sorda.  I cords/discords/hymned<br/>
until I was down 3 bubbles, and selo&#39;ed/healed - this took about 15 minutes,<br/>
then a passing druid finnished it off.<br/>
<br/>
So I loot and I get a Grinnenne charm?  Is that the charm I need for lambent<br/>
bracers?  Whats up with the spelling?  and this thing is a bard only lore no<br/>
drop 3 ac 3 cha?  Is this the right charm, I don&#39;t wanna waste the bracelet,<br/>
lambent stone and pp if its wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx<br/>
