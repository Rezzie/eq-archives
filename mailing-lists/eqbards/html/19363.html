&gt;Why don&#39;t we ask for a very simple song for 49? Unvis Undead, nothing fancy, <br/>
&gt;just plain old invis undead. It can&#39;t be twisted with anything, subjecst to <br/>
&gt;song range, etc, just like all our songs. I understand (sorta) why our invis <br/>
&gt;song had this component taken out, but now invis undead is about the only <br/>
&gt;thing we Can&#39;t do. </span></blockquote></div>
