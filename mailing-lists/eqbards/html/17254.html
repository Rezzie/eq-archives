<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408389386">I am a half elf bard. I went with 95 str and 90 cha. I have been going with<br/>
cha over other stats. I got +7 cha +5 dex rings and the earings that add +5<br/>
cha and +2 ac. thats 114 cha. I am more of a team player then a soloest! I<br/>
was wondering if thats enough cha. Or should I go back and remake my bard<br/>
with more cha and less str, because I was told by a bard in the game you<br/>
need 150+ cha to do anything with your songs like charm and croud control<br/>
above 30+ in level.<br/>
<br/>
Is this true?!?!?<br/>
