at lvl 15,get good loot and not die?  I&#39;m so poor, I have yet to buy my lvl<br/>
11, 14, and 15 songs.  I am so poor that in order to make extra cash to<br/>
build up my smithing skill, I fish.  On the other hand, my fishing is 50<br/>
now.  How you measure fishing skill I don&#39;t know, but I am AVERAGE in<br/>
fishing!<br/>

EROLLISI MARR<br/>
always on at around 10 pm CST (hint, hint)<br/>
will respond to any tells and come running to grovel for donations when<br/>
offered (another hint)<br/>
I do not mind being handed cash or sellable items but I won&#39;t use a given<br/>
item (unless its really nice, i.e. troll hide belt, blackened iron crown)<br/>
unless I&#39;ve done something for it. (big hint)</div>
