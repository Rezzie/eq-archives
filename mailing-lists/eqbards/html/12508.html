pointing out the differences between slowing a mob&#39;s attacks,<br/>
and stopping them entirely (stun).  Each have their place, and<br/>
effectively using them hinges on the player&#39;s ability to<br/>
correctly identify when one or the other will work better.  <br/>
Defensively, I classify stuns with heals and rune - you can<br/>
use it to save someone&#39;s life.  Slowdowns I classify as<br/>
battle-time-management (attack speedups, mesmerize, regen,<br/>
DoTs, wizard option to unload nukes, etc).<br/>
