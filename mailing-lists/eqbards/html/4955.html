<b>Subject:</b> RE: Bard Petition- Stealth Nerfing <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516217394">The petition should ask Verant to adopt and Open Disclosure<br/>
Policy which commits them to reveal ANY changes made to a<br/>
class that affect gameplay in the next patch message.<br/>
<br/>
As we all know, Verant likes to &quot;stealth nerf&quot; classes and<br/>
Bards have probably been the biggest victim. Its basically<br/>
a form of cowardice in that they dont want to take the heat<br/>
for their actions. However, as paying customers I think it<br/>
is reasonable for us to have the right to know what is being<br/>
done to the characters we are paying to play and have invested<br/>
so much time into. Of course, other classes would benefit<br/>
from such an official disclosure policy, Bards have been the<br/>
hardest hit by this and as such it should be valid to include<br/>
it in a Bard petition.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, Brad and Smedley are always noting how much<br/>
thought and debate go into every change to a class. They<br/>
to agonize over every issue and debate it among the developers.<br/>
Therefore, it should be very difficult for them to list these<br/>
changes since they should be well aware of them and be able<br/>
to list them off the top of their heads since they spent so<br/>
many hours discussing them.<br/>
