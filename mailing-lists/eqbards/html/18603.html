<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821150686">Okay - so this isn&#39;t nearly so good as the Ocean of Tears where the boats <br/>
can sail west to go east.... but, it&#39;s still pretty funny...<br/>
On Kunark, there is a large lake (the Lake of Ill Omen).  Rumour has it <br/>
that this lake is supposed to be salty - and this might even be supported <br/>
by the river that flows (uphill in some places) from the ocean to the lake <br/>
- but if that&#39;s the way it&#39;s supposed to be - where is all the water <br/>
going?  And why isn&#39;t this whole zone flooded?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - it started out as an argument about why the water flowed from the <br/>
ocean into the lake, instead of backwards - until we remembered that <br/>
there&#39;s some NPC that says the lake is salty...<br/>
