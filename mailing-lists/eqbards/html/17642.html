<div id="ygrps-yiv-1981241689">Engulfing Darkness now overwrites Chain (but strangely enough,<br/>
Chain can still overwrite Engulfing Darkness).<br/>
<br/>
My rogue friend had whatever weapon it is that procs this, and<br/>
while I was chain/fearing to finish off a seafury, his proc<br/>
would set the seafury free.  But I could immediately Chain it<br/>
again to stop it.  Odd.<br/>
