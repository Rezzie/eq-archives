<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141090409">My one tip to you: if you see more than one thing coming in on a pull, TURN <br/>
OFF ALL SONGS!!!  And don&#39;t resume singing until the enchanters get all <br/>
extras mez&#39;d.  Unless you just really like unecessary deaths.<br/>

Amusing side story: was clearing to Cazic in fear a couple weekends ago.  <br/>
Pulled the golems, which means Cazic began DTing people.  Killed the golem, <br/>
everyone sat to camp.  Teeth, a fellow bard, shouts &quot;I&#39;ll bet 100pp that the <br/>
next DT goes to a bard!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cazic Thule says, &quot;TEETH!&quot;<br/>
Teeth has been slain by Cazic Thule!<br/>
