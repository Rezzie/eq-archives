He claims that the mana song definately gives him mana with every pulse,<br/>
as opposed to being a song that last has a duration like most of our <br/>
other songs.<br/>
<br/>
At some point I had seen data from a timing test that someone had done<br/>
on this subject.  I remember it saying that it didn&#39;t matter whether the<br/>
mana song was sung repeatedly, or weaved with 2 others songs -- the mana<br/>
recover was the same.<br/>
<br/>

It does regenerate on the pulse it seems.  What I tend to do when my party<br/>
has a healer type in it is JUST regenerate mana and let him do the healing.<br/>
If there is not a healer type in the party.  I will do two ticks mana song<br/>
and one tick healing song.  This generally has the best results.<br/>

(He even went so far as to group with another bard and insult my singing<br/>
skills.  Yikes!)<br/>

<br/>
As for this little comment...if he doesnt like your singing skills, cut him<br/>
off......the mana song is like crack cocaine to mana junkies &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
