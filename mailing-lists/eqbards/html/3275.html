<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537086718">My bio says, &quot;if you are reading this, you are too close.&quot;  I know, not   <br/>
real<br/>
friendly, but I just hate having my equipment inspected unless I give<br/>
permission.  It&#39;s sort of feels like somebody going through my purse.   <br/>
 Heh.<br/>
Actually, that&#39;s not what&#39;s going on at all. When someone inspects you,   <br/>
it&#39;s more akin to having them &quot;focus their attention&quot; on you, than it is   <br/>
&quot;going through your purse&quot;. After all, think about what you get to see   <br/>
when you inspect someone -- basically, just what a you could see IRL when   <br/>
you actually look at them. Since the in-game representations of most of   <br/>
the items you are carrying are so poor, you *need* this just to &quot;see them   <br/>
properly&quot;.<br/>
