As long as I have roamed Norrath, we have been prevented from drumming the<br/>
Accelerando in completely underground areas. Paw, Runneye, the Aqueducts,<br/>
Guk--all these places seem to be off limite for drumming, pehaps because we<br/>
feel the loud echo woudl bring a cave-in. I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Your confusion may be that some underground areas appear to allow this.<br/>
Parts of  Crushbone and Blackburrow, pehaps, places where you can see the<br/>
sky occasionally.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;Last night I tried to cast Selo&#39;s in Paw and got the message that I must be<br/>
&gt;outside to cast this spell. Has this always been like this? I&#39;d swear I had<br/>
&gt;done this many times before.<br/>
