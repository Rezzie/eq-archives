&gt;Absolutely.  Some idiot last night attacked Genni and trained<br/>
&gt;the entire Temple to the zone.  Oddly enough Gardern stayed<br/>
&gt;behind (out of his agro range, or player died)  Then Genni<br/>
&gt;was no where to be found, tracking or not.  I still got the<br/>
&gt;lambent sapphire to work, without her visually in the zone.<br/>

Anyways, I am sure Gardern can cough up the Lambent Sapphires because a <br/>
friend of mine is in newly acquired full Lambent. Unfortunately, Gardern <br/>
decided to bug out on me. =(<br/>
I gave him a lambent stone and 2 sapphires (in seperate slots, not stacked), <br/>
and he says, &quot;blah blah blah here is your prize - a Lambent Sapphire!!&quot; I <br/>
get a bunch of faction changes, and some xp, but NO Lambent <br/>
Sapphire...*sigh*<br/>
<br/>
So I petitioned, took a screenshot, bugged it, and even /reported Gardern <br/>
heh =) (ah, what the hell).<br/>
