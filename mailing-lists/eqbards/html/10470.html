<div id="ygrps-yiv-614690328">Actually when they announced the change I didn&#39;t notice that huge an<br/>
improvement at all. Shada says it&#39;s better now but then maybe he&#39;s just<br/>
gotten used to the &quot;new&quot; difficulty level. :)<br/>
<br/>
After the announce improvement I remember logging on one day and having<br/>
it take 6 trys to start Selo&#39;s. Not a happy day. <br/>

&gt; 	A long time ago didn&#39;t they mention in a patch that level 40+ were changed<br/>
&gt; to have less of a chance at missing notes or was this just talk?<br/>
&gt; 8)<br/>
&gt; 8)I was particularly annoyed at this too, and, I think it&#39;s the main<br/>
&gt; 8)reason we miss so many notes on our 40+ songs.  I have a feeling the<br/>
&gt; 8)code tests against Level x 5 + 5 for the skill check and doesn&#39;t make<br/>
&gt; 8)allowances for the skill cap. It seems the logical explanation for why<br/>
&gt; 8)our 40+ songs are so hard to start.<br/>
