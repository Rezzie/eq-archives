<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125684443">I think you might be referring to the dragon statue in Eastern Wastes.  If<br/>
so that is the zone entrance to the Sleeper Tomb dungeon.  AFAIK, only Fires<br/>
of Heaven has figured out how to get the key to enter this dungeon. <br/>

Ok, not entirely a bard topic, but as collectors of information I figured<br/>
someone here would know.  Where does this portal go to and what is the key?<br/>
Also, I sure don&#39;t recall seeing this portal here when I was fighting there<br/>
a couple of weeks ago; and how the heck could I have missed that giant<br/>
spinning ball???  When did this get added?<br/>
