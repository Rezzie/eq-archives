<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504532776">You can still bring Phinny to zone.  You send a camoed druid to his lair,<br/>
hit him with a DOT then COH the druid to zoen.  Phinny and/or his sidekicks<br/>
will show up one by one for very easy pickings.  We did it with:<br/>
54 druid<br/>
60 mage<br/>
56 wiz<br/>
58 war<br/>
55 bard<br/>
56? cleric<br/>

I wasn&#39;t complaining about my guild/leaders with the thumb up my butt<br/>
comment.  We tried Gone recently and we just don&#39;t have the resists to do<br/>
her.  I think people in our guild got lazy since we whomping other dragons<br/>
(Trak, Wuoshi, Serv, Talendor) and never got good resist equipment.  We have<br/>
been working on it for a couple of weeks now and I think we&#39;ll make another<br/>
run at Gone soon.<br/>
