<br/>
I was wondering if anyone knows what the lute of the<br/>
gypsy princess does.  I recently traded a barbed whip<br/>
for it and cant tell much of a difference from my<br/>
normal lute.  My fellow party members seem to think it<br/>
helps them heal faster, but when I tried to time it<br/>
the effect seemed the same.  Any info would be greatly<br/>
appreciated.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
best regards<br/>
