<div id="ygrps-yiv-1670318263">I&#39;d heard about the nerf to Donal&#39;s which is probably well justified, but<br/>
not about Complete Heal.  What are they planning on doing to Complete Heal?<br/>
<br/>
I see the Eq Casters&#39; post said defensive skillS, wonder if they really<br/>
meant Defense skill only?  I can think of some other minor tweaks I&#39;d like<br/>
to see to bard skills, skill caps come to mind.<br/>
