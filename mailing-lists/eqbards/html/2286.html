<div id="ygrps-yiv-468550904">Does our invisibility song make us invisible to undead? I seem to<br/>
remember someone saying that it does. A friend of mine (who quite<br/>
honestly doesn&#39;t know as much as he thinks he does) tells me that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t. I am quite some time away from getting this song, so I hope<br/>
someone can tell me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
