<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379278720">This will make me seem lazy as hell, but I know someone out there has the<br/>
exact requirements for all the lambent armor pieces and the exact<br/>
requirements for all the lambent gemstones and I am hoping that you will<br/>
post this one more time for me as I seem to not be able to find this<br/>
info...especially for the gemstones.  I just don&#39;t want to run all the way<br/>
to the temple just to find out how many gold pieces I need to buy the gem<br/>
components and all that.<br/>
