<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999417764">Oh, btw.. I&#39;m not suggesting that Bards are absolutely required.  We&#39;ll never be as desired as Clerics, Warriors or Rogues.  I&#39;m just stating that Bards can be put to use in a significant role.<br/>

  Well Dark you wouldn&#39;t being experiencing anything if you weren&#39;t on the<br/>
  raid.  And if you weren&#39;t on the raid, the raid wouldn&#39;t be noticing<br/>
  anything different either.  You need, &quot;need&quot; not want, 1 bard on a raid.<br/>
  Any more bards would be better replaced by another class.<br/>
