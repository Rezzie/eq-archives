<div id="ygrps-yiv-966143904">My necro fought an EE in East Karana with a pet.  I of course got charmed, <br/>
the pet was fighting me and I died.  Was bound in the zone, so when I came <br/>
back to get my corpse, the pet was just standing there, non-aggro.  I <br/>
brought up another pet and they duelled... hehe   We won, but got no exp... <br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;  That would be an interesting way to make easy exp... hehe<br/>
