<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338417783">I have to back up John here.  In fact, many lottery winners end up less<br/>
happy after winning a lottery; either because they learn that most of the<br/>
people they thought were there friends are really greedy leeches who want to<br/>
suck them dry of  the money they won, or because they sell their 20 year<br/>
payoff for a lump sum, then squander it all on gambling, drugs, or other<br/>
foolishness.<br/>

There have been several psychological studies assessing the<br/>
happiness of lottery winners.  Aside from a high immediately<br/>
after winning, most revert back to their former levels of<br/>
happiness.</div>
