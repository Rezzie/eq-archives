<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255435127">I was wondering if enough people on the list would be interested for it<br/>
to be worth organising a gettogether on one of the servers. As obviously<br/>
we couldn&#39;t do much serious adventuring with L1 characters for those<br/>
visiting from other server, I thought the alternative would be to do<br/>
something silly.<br/>
<br/>
About the silliest (and fun looking) thing I&#39;ve seen done so far is the<br/>
naked troll race. While I wouldn&#39;t want to steal that particular idea, I<br/>
think borrowing the concept is ok, so what I had in mind was something<br/>
called the March of the Lemmings. The idea would be to all create L1<br/>
gnomes and march all across Faydwer, take the boat to Freeport, then go<br/>
up to Lavastorm and jump off the edge of the Solusek crater into the<br/>
molten lava. However, if someone can come up with a sillier or less<br/>
derivitive idea, I&#39;m certainly open to that as well.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested? How many people are on the list now? Maybe we should<br/>
put up a poll to see who would come.<br/>
