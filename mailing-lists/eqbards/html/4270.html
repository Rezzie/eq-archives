<div id="ygrps-yiv-562805276"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;    So, we have an armor that is arguably the best magical armor that<br/>
&gt;can be had, for more than half of the players in EQ.  (Yes, Mithril and<br/>
&gt;a few other pieces are better but are only wearable by a few, for<br/>
&gt;example we bards cannot wear Mithril).  And, it is only found in one<br/>
&gt;place.  And, it is a rare drop.  What this means is that there will<br/>
&gt;NEVER be enough ruby to go around.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Doh, somebody needs to tell my bard to take off his mithril bp (acronymn!<br/>
deal!) then. Bards can wear the mithril breastplate as well as silvered<br/>
(looks like steel, better than rubi) plate greaves. I dont have a spot of<br/>
rubi on me besides the bracers, and im debating trading those in for<br/>
something else i got (stats vs ac). And its not a rare drop, the mithril<br/>
and rubicite is best described as uncommon. If you have ever tried to camp<br/>
an actual rare drop, you know what im talking about.   <br/>
