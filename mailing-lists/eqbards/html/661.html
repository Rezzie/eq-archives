<b>Subject:</b> Re: Which song for soloing? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326229101">just a question about all this song juggling.  what is the roleplaying<br/>
aspect of it.  personally i sing one song, because in reality i can<br/>
only sing one song.  if roleplaying doesn&#39;t matter to you fine, but<br/>
this is just an observation for all you rpers like me.<br/>
in case anybody knows me i am going to have to end my character Olczyk<br/>
on tarew marr soon.  long story don&#39;t ask.  just wish everyone good bye<br/>
from his perspective, and i will be back as some new incarnation soon.<br/>
<br/>
