<div id="ygrps-yiv-522534051">I&#39;ve been tweaking mine and always seem to make it worse.  Anyone have one<br/>
out there that they are proud of?  BTW - I have an Nvidia card (Geforce2<br/>
GTS) so obviously using D3D.  I think this makes a difference since on my<br/>
old box I had a Voodoo3 2000 - and the colors somewhat different different..<br/>

Thanks!<br/>
