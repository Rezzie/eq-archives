<div id="ygrps-yiv-568306372"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; But anyway, that doesn&#39;t alter the fact that Blackburrow is <br/>
&gt; laggier than any<br/>
&gt; other low level zone (except perhaps low-level RoK zones) and <br/>
&gt; still seems an<br/>
&gt; odd choice for a bard to hunt in.  Tszaaz, do you experience <br/>
&gt; lag ANYWHERE???<br/>

28000 modem. The only zones that were unhuntable were Unrest and near the<br/>
Aviak City in SK (and Kunark before I lowered my clipping to about1/3). 128<br/>
makes alll the difference :o)<br/>
