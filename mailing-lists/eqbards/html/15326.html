<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547779110">I guess this condition can be classified as a bug but how often do bards<br/>
carry around two of the same instrument?  The only time I have more than one<br/>
instrument of the same type is when I&#39;m carrying an extra flute to give to a<br/>
party member to hold on to in case I die in a dungeon and need the flute for<br/>
the invis song.  Instruments don&#39;t weight much but they take up an inventory<br/>
slot so IMO there isn&#39;t any reason to carry multiples of the same<br/>
instrument.<br/>

&gt; &gt; There is an interaction bug with instruments. If you have an instrument <br/>
&gt; &gt; equipped and pickup in your mouse pointer another instrument of the same<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; type (ie string, wind, brass,percussion) you will lose the instrument<br/>
&gt; bonus. <br/>
