<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500756916">3 50+ active bards: Me, just made 54.  Suladan 55 still plays his bard<br/>
pretty much.  Kaldivar 53 not really enjoying high level life (hard to get<br/>
good groups, exp so slow, etc. etc.) so he has been leveling up a warrior<br/>
and playing other classes.  <br/>
<br/>
Lately, I have been playing 52 Cleric and 51 Enchanter.  Learning these<br/>
other classes is more interesting to me at the moment.  Also, I have 2 PC&#39;s<br/>
now and spend a fair amount of time driving 2 chars.  <br/>
