<div id="ygrps-yiv-582932917">What do you mean, switching it back?  Back to the way assist was before the<br/>
last patch?  That didn&#39;t really affect this macro.  The /pet atack is needed<br/>
because some pets don&#39;t start attacking their new targets when you recharm<br/>
them.  You can tell your pet to start taunting?  I never knew that.<br/>

&gt; One comment on your macro Matt. Since VI is changing assist back again,<br/>
&gt; the seperate /pet attack command isn&#39;t needed right? How about<br/>
&gt; substituting /pet taunt to try to reduce the damage to your party.<br/>
