<br/>
due to some comments people made about sound, I checked my sound settings. I<br/>
found my &quot;Sound Realism&quot; slider was set nearly all the way to left! I moved<br/>
it all the way to right, noticed a message that said &quot;3d Sound Enabled&quot; and<br/>
now the difference is amazing! All the extra sounds are great, listening to<br/>
a Desert Madman mumbling to himself was hilarious!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all</div>
