message<br/>
<br/>
discuss away, it&#39;s all quite interesting, but, PLEASE, at least clip off<br/>
previous comments down to maximum one past entry. i really don&#39;t need to<br/>
read the past weeks conversation over again. plus, when the digests are 45+K<br/>
it takes a bit for my clunker to load. *grins*<br/>
