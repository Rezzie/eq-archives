<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074824001">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
This weekend was good to me as I finally hit level 30. Then I ventured deep<br/>
and fought in lower guk for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
Well, now I&#39;m looking forward once again and I&#39;ve set my sights on a MM<br/>
Battle Drum, a lute of the Gypsy Princess and a Gypsy Lute. (So I can make<br/>
my lambent BP)<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping that you all could share some of your tactics used when<br/>
fighting in the castle to prevent the famous MM trains as well as to give me<br/>
some idea of what level party (and which classes) would be necessary to<br/>
break and hold the ball room.<br/>
