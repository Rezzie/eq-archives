 </span></blockquote>Holy moley, Talies.  That&#39;s better than the off-hand weapon I have at level 59, and I get a lot of jealous<br/>
comments about the one I&#39;ve GOT.  Crystalline Short Sword (12/24) goes for 12k, just to give you an idea,<br/>
and yours has more damage and less delay.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s worth quite a bit more than a BoH (maybe 2-3<br/>
times, the BoH is common enough that the price is dropping).  The Lute of the Howler plus a Nostrolo&#39;s (or<br/>
at least the hard coins) deal that you suggested is one that wouldn&#39;t shaft you.  They might not see it<br/>
that way, but I certainly think it would be more than fair of you.<br/>
