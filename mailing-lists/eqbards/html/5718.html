&gt; &gt; 22 -- Alenia&#39;s Disenchanting Melody.  As far as I can tell, this<br/>
&gt; &gt;       doesn&#39;t do squat.  Never memorized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It removes any malicious spells on you or your group members.<br/>
&gt; It actually is useful in an area with lots of necros or shamans.<br/>
&gt; This is confirmed, 1st hand information and not off a website =)<br/>
&gt; Especially if those shamans are casting drowsy-line spell one<br/>
&gt; after one after one, if the song cancels those too =) (not sure)<br/>
&gt; Also, have not tried, but I bet you 100:1 ratio that it will remove<br/>
&gt; root.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;ve gotten this to work first hand, can you provide the rest of us<br/>
with some info - what spells it cancelled, how long it took, etc?  I&#39;ve<br/>
never &quot;field tested&quot; this one since I don&#39;t find myself fighting too many<br/>
necros, but when I tested it on a druid friends of mines dots, it did<br/>
absolutely nothing - dot did full damage, for full duration.  This was a few<br/>
<br/>
weeks back - I&#39;d love to hear its working now.<br/>
