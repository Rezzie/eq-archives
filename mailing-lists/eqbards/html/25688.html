<div id="ygrps-yiv-143138538">Don&#39;t think brass is nerfed. I sat on the dock at Kaladim  & played my only brass song while waiting for boat to Freeport & again on the Siren&#39;s Bane. Went up from 20 to 40 in XP. So I guess it&#39;s a matter of finding a place that you can play disonance songs without getting hit on.<br/>
