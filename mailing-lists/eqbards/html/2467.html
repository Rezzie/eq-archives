&quot;There!&quot; cries the Mariner, &quot;There comes a ship o&#39;er the line!&quot;<br/>
&quot;But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?&quot;<br/>
&quot;See, onward she comes, onward she lives, out of the sun,&quot;<br/>
&quot;See, she has no crew, she has no life....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just reminded me of the ghostly ship in &quot;Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner&quot;.<br/>
