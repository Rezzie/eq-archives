<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568345336">My conclusions after studying the CR/HR/DR (Dragon Raid) messages suggest 2<br/>
things:<br/>
<br/>
(1)    GZ is probably right (read: not shooting us a line) on the<br/>
deminishing returns after 200<br/>
<br/>
but,<br/>
<br/>
(2)    Dragon spells are more difficult to save against, and likely have the<br/>
built-in minus CR/HR penelty that GZ mentions several of our songs (spells,<br/>
et al.) are plagued with.<br/>
<br/>
Given a nominal -75, that would account for sucess at 250 and<br/>
disillusionment at 200.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I&#39;ll go add it to alt.conspiracy.everquest.<br/>
