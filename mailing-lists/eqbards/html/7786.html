&gt; Heh yes well the shaman form of the spell is a lot more efficent then the<br/>
&gt; mana stone. The necro form of it is the best in the game the level 34 spell<br/>
&gt; for it trades 15hp for 15mana. The manastone is not that efficent at all.<br/>

the same.  The only difference is Shaman get regen rather early and can<br/>
get an advantage out of using the stone without outside assistance.<br/>
