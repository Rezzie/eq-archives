<div id="ygrps-yiv-191569410">Well, last night I kept getting added to the hate list of every Drachnid in<br/>
Firiona Vie, leading to some fairly epic collections of targets for my AE<br/>
songs :o) . I thought pixie strike might be to blame but I stopped using it<br/>
and zoned and still was voted most popular among the Arachnid set. The night<br/>
before it was Giants in the Frontier mountains, I was &quot;pulling&quot; everything<br/>
if I came off the hill to the flat before the castle. Now, *there* I was<br/>
using both pixie strike and Song of the Sirens. Something really really<br/>
stinky is up with bards and hate lists, it&#39;s gettiing ugly out there.<br/>
