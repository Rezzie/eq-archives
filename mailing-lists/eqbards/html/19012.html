<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-530913411">I haven&#39;t used Lament much, having traveled a lot with<br/>
a druid who uses Harmony very well.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am faced with going to Kurn&#39;s Tower with my<br/>
group, an undead, indoor dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
A member of my group is telling me lament won&#39;t work<br/>
against undead anymore. <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me about this?  I&#39;m 24th lvl now and<br/>
have a charisma of 120.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
