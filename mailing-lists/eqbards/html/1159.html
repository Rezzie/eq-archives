<div id="ygrps-yiv-388278048">Ok, here is a good one:<br/>
<br/>
Who can tell me anything about alcohol tolerance?  I drink different kinds<br/>
and quantities of Alcohol in the game but do not really know how this works<br/>
to raise your skill in Alcohol Tolerance.  Has anyone been successful at<br/>
raising this skill and if so, what are the best alcohols to drink to do so,<br/>
and which ones are not?  I have been drinking primarily mead and not<br/>
noticing much improvement.<br/>
