<div id="ygrps-yiv-230931498">I agree, the easiest solution is to have all the bards not go on any of<br/>
the runs where you are being shut out.  I hear that the dragons are very<br/>
tough without bards, so make sure none of the bards go.  Tell other high<br/>
level bards about your boycott and they will likely not cross the picket<br/>
line.<br/>
