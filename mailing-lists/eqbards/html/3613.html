In Halas today I overheard a 15th level<br/>
shaman having a conversation with a<br/>
female human npc (Thadres something<br/>
or other)  She mentioned that her brother<br/>
had mysteriously attacked a group of<br/>
bards, and been slain.  Then spouted<br/>
something incoherent about the questioner<br/>
crossing her or some such, and proceeded<br/>
to make VERY short work of him/her.<br/>
<br/>
Then, out in Everfrost, there are 2 new kinds<br/>
of skeletons (red to the 3rd level shaman<br/>
I was goofing off with) called a Vengeful<br/>
Lyricist and a Vengeful Soloist.<br/>
<br/>
Methinks tis time to get my bard cross the<br/>
continent to check things out.  I am only<br/>
1 level higher than the shaman who bought<br/>
it though, so it could be a dangerous thing.<br/>
