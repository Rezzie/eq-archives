<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649281174">I&#39;ve confirmed with three other bards over level 30 that there is a problem <br/>
with Chains not giving any messages when used on creatures that have <br/>
previous effects cast on them. As was mentioned yesterday, any mob with SOW <br/>
on it can no longer be chained and will tear off to find help. This nearly <br/>
killed me last night in Solusek&#39;s Eye. I was healing at the clockworks <br/>
waiting for my partner when a young goblin strolled through for some reason <br/>
and attacked.<br/>
<br/>
Chains is NOT being resisted but is not giving any success or failure <br/>
messages at all when used on certain creatures. After I put the beatdown on <br/>
the young&#39;n he ran off to find help-- way to fast for me to catch him <br/>
without Selo&#39;s. He brought back a flame gobbo and two cinders. Chain worked <br/>
just fine on the flame but still would not give any messages when used on <br/>
the young one (who had been SOW&#39;ed by one of the gobbo shamans on his <br/>
path).<br/>
<br/>
Luckily my partner got back at that time and evacuated us out, I was about <br/>
to fear and run for my life when he came in and started casting. This new <br/>
&quot;bug&quot; or feature will get you killed if you are expecting Chains to hold <br/>
the mob in front of you. I&#39;ve done a bug report as should everyone else who <br/>
notices this effect.<br/>
