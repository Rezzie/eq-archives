&gt; their attacks?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>From what I found last night, it was useless.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; amount of damage from the shields alone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is exactly what I found as well. My most effective<br/>
attack strategy was to constantly bellow because I didn&#39;t<br/>
take damage when I hit them with a bellow. It was a pain<br/>
free 9 points of damage each time.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up fighting a lot of rock dervishes and a few<br/>
goblins (man they group up quick) while I was there.</div>
