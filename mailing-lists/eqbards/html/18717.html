<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459892344">I know its crazy!  I left Kunark to get my 26th level song and picked up the<br/>
27th level song as well just in case figuring that would hold me for at<br/>
least a month.  Its a week and a bit later and I&#39;m trying to figure out how<br/>
to get my level 28 song!  At least I don&#39;t have any big rush to buy the<br/>
lousy 29th level song.<br/>

*Grin* Aren&#39;t we all just SO into Kunark.<br/>
The only reason I&#39;ve left since it opened was<br/>
to buy spellS! And that for as little time as was necessary<br/>
to do that.</div>
