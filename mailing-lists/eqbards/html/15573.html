<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097955579">Melaniel your story is wonderful!  I regret even more now being already camped that<br/>
day instead of in Sol with you.  Sounds like it was just wonderful though, and much<br/>
better experience for you.  Congratulations on your achievement!<br/>
<br/>
As for lambent gauntlets, just find me in game; I have a present for you.<br/>
