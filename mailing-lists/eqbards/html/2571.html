<div id="ygrps-yiv-562474067">Y&#39;know everybody divides things up into &quot;powergamers&quot; and &quot;roleplayers.&quot;  I<br/>
just do not understand this.  I&#39;ve known plenty of powergamers.  And I&#39;ve<br/>
known plenty who could roleplay many under the table, as it were.  Style of<br/>
play is one thing, HOW you play it is entirely something else.<br/>
<br/>
I read Brad M.&#39;s comments on fighters, and can&#39;t agree more.  Understand<br/>
he&#39;s coming from the idea that EVERYBODY roleplays.  Not his idea, an old<br/>
idea from MUDs, before Quake.  But still, I think I am hard pressed to find<br/>
somebody who doesn&#39;t roleplay, in EQ,  if you approach them roleplaying.  I<br/>
tend to think most will roleplay actually, don&#39;t understand all this<br/>
nonsense of a switch (On: Verilly! Off: Yo dude!  On: Behither to yonder<br/>
place where we met yonder Off: Quick before the MOB kicks my ass!  Did that<br/>
for friends once hehehehh).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, EQ is designed along the idea of the ace spade hearts diamonds<br/>
mentality.  Four types of players:  Power gamers, socializers, explorers,<br/>
PKs.  When I read Brad&#39;s comments I realized how much he still carries that<br/>
original MUD study.<br/>
<br/>
Most bard&#39;s, by the way, should be &quot;explorers&quot; the extreme rare group for<br/>
MUDS.  Yet, by our abilities I think explorers are attracted to this class<br/>
in EQ.  I think that is why this is the most intelligent onelist.  Explorers<br/>
are rare and really really smart.  But I&#39;ve known a few explorers in my day<br/>
who do NOT roleplay.<br/>
<br/>
How you play or the way you play, there&#39;s a distinction.<br/>
<br/>
Speak intelligently and understand Brad&#39;s posts, read this which has<br/>
influenced countless muds through UO and EQ and likely beyond:<br/>
