<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703402345">Ok, this is completely off topic BUT I need your help.  My guild is doing a<br/>
joint guild event in South Karana sometime in the near future (with 5 other<br/>
guilds).  I, being a fun loving party bard, have been appointed to the<br/>
&quot;events&quot; committee.  Problem is I&#39;m not feeling very creative today and I&#39;m<br/>
fresh out of new and amusing ideas.  I want to try to do something fun that<br/>
isn&#39;t the same old same old.  I figure the best place to go for some ideas<br/>
would be here!  The home of the fun loving, party enhancing, entertaining<br/>
bard.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for you ideas in advance :)<br/>
