Folks, every friday over on the CoN discussion board I drop a troll post in just for fun, the first<br/>
one was about how you should be able to store bind locations in your spellbook (UO Recall<br/>
effectivly) the next was about how clerics who didn&#39;t heal me when asked (and shamens who didn&#39;t<br/>
SoW) weren&#39;t doing their job :o) the third (under my own name even) was about getting a sex change<br/>
operation...*laughs* every time I got people to get hooked, my point it I know about trolling (never<br/>
mind all the years on Usenet, when netcom was as reprehensible an address as AOL became later).<br/>
<br/>
Our MrS8N is a troll pure and simple, he is here to stir up an otherwise useful list, to get us all<br/>
talking about him. He has little to nothing of value to say, or, if there IS content it is still for<br/>
the purpose of causing dischord. For everyones sanity, just ignore him, he is worth it, really.<br/>
