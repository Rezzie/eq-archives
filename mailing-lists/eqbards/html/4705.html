&gt; behind the counter.  I tried Carillion once and got no<br/>
&gt; message.  Hmm, odd.  I moved to the side a bit.  Still no<br/>
&gt; message.  After moving around some more, I figured out that<br/>
&gt; the area the merchant is standing in is slightly recessed.  <br/>
&gt; If you are not standing in the recessed area, that is you are<br/>
&gt; standing one step up, you are at a sufficiently different<br/>
&gt; Z-axis level that you cannot cast on nor talk to the merchant!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What&#39;s even more wonderful is that we have this restriction in<br/>
&gt; combat, whereas mobs do not.  If you&#39;re fighting on a slope,<br/>

the mobs I was fighting fled, then somehow returned walking up<br/>
in the air.  He could hit me just fine.  I however could not<br/>
touch him, and between him and the other mob I was fighting, I<br/>
was stunned to death.<br/>
