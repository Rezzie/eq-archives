I think that we should petition for the following.<br/>
 <br/>
1. Allow Identify in a trade window<br/>
2. Request more Lore on Items, even mundane items.<br/>

    It would be nice if the song would work when cast on items in a =<br/>
trade window.  This would allow us to help other players with No Drop/No =<br/>
Trade identify the lore...<br/>
