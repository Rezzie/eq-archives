<div id="ygrps-yiv-800142985">i did not ask him but i will, though he didn&#39;t mention it going up at 54.<br/>
also, what are our weapon skills going up per level?  i know my duel wield,<br/>
1h blunt and 1h slashing are at 205 or 206 now, i miss it a lot in the<br/>
battle spam.  so rather than the 5 per level, is it only 2 or 3?  as long as<br/>
these levels are, i doubt i will not have any of those not maxed by the next<br/>
time i level.<br/>
