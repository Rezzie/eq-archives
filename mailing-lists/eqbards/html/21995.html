Notes on assist: make sure the monk isn&#39;t switching targets! I was getting<br/>
yelled at alot, turned out our monk puller was accidentally switching<br/>
targets due to the way he has his mouse controls working. It took us all<br/>
being in the same room playing to finally figure out what was happening. The<br/>
tip on the mob hitting the puller will probably account for the few<br/>
mistargets since then. <br/>
BTW, ever noticed if you hit assist before the puller is back in melee<br/>
range, you will sometimes get a different mob, even on a single pull?<br/>
