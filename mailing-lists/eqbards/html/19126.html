<div id="ygrps-yiv-16041459">Agreed, which is why I give him props in this case.  Still if I had his job,<br/>
and thank goodness I do not, I would make sure I learned a lot about every<br/>
class.  I have noticed he has had some better ideas lately.  I still think<br/>
removing the invis component is the right move.  It would make the song more<br/>
useful overall while reducing its uses in some specialty situations.  There<br/>
is precious little you cannot outrun with SSoT and levitation alone.<br/>

Guys,<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a necro, he had an idea then got corrected on it.  Quit bashing for no<br/>
damn reason.  Gordon has never played a bard, and likely never will.<br/>
<br/>
FYI:  I&#39;ve known him, in game, since Beta 2.  He&#39;s a nice guy, fun to hunt<br/>
with and very knowledgeable about his OWN class.  Just like we are.  You<br/>
can&#39;t blame him for not knowing bards.  He&#39;s a mouthpiece, nothing more.  He<br/>
had an idea, offered it up and was wrong and admitted it.<br/>
<br/>
What MORE do you want?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll jump on him anytime he&#39;s blatantly wrong but when he admits his mistake<br/>
give him a break<br/>
