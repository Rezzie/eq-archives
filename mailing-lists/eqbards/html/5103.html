<b>Subject:</b> Ashenwood Spear Owner&#39;s manual??? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-148753195">A kind fiend has loaned me the use of her Ashenwood Spear.  Unfortunatey,<br/>
the owner&#39;s manual has been mislaid.  It has 10 charges of the Haste Effect.<br/>
My question is... are those 10 all it ever has?  Or are you able to get it<br/>
re-charged? And if so, how does it get re-charged?<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>
