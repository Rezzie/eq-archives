<div id="ygrps-yiv-180646420">I really don&#39;t know if it is a lot of &quot;mediocre players&quot; are hitting <br/>
the 50+ range, or if it is all the twinks:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;a friend went to twink his newb rogue in guk last night using <br/>
his druid and he got from lev 1 to lev 17 in 5 hours in upper <br/>
guk. I know he&#39;s loving the new xp system.&quot;<br/>

I know of a level 50 warrior in my guild who has less than <br/>
five /played days (second computer with 50+ cleric/50+ chanter <br/>
characters), and, as far as I know, has never grouped. Do you think I <br/>
plan on putting my life on the line assuming he knows how to play his <br/>
class?<br/>
