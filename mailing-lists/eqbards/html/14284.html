<div id="ygrps-yiv-590987206"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  NPCs do _not_ _not_ _not_ have unlimited mana.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  They have a whole s-load of it, and it regens very very fast<br/>
&gt;  when they are not in combat.  But once you see a mob spend alot<br/>
&gt;  The thing is you have to be much higher than the con of the mob<br/>
&gt;  in order to make it become spent from casting.  I imagine a white<br/>
&gt;  con caster could kill you 2-4 times over with the amount of mana<br/>
&gt;  it has.<br/>
&gt;  Harmonic.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately in terms of even cons it effectively is unlimited.  Even green<br/>
no xp bandit wizard casters will kill a single PC many levels after he stops<br/>
getting xp for them.  If the song cut their mana by 10% per pulse it might<br/>
matter, but otherwise its pretty much a waste.<br/>
