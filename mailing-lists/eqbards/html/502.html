Seriously, I think that each class should have class specific<br/>
equipment.  Or if not bard only, with benefits that would only be<br/>
of use to a bard (eg a face mask that increases the singing skill, or<br/>
the effect of singing songs, or gloves that increase the effect of<br/>
using an instrument).<br/>
