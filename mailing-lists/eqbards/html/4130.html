&gt; &gt; Psalm of Warmth is a very very very useful song if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I tried this tonight in a party in lower guk. It worked nicely except it<br/>
&gt; seems to have a nasty interaction bug with the Guise of the Deceiver<br/>
&gt; Dark Elf illusion. One of the people I party with is a Troll and the<br/>
&gt; Dark Elf illusion has been a godsend for dungeon crawling, as it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; fairly obvious that most dungeons weren&#39;t really designed to fit the<br/>
&gt; large races very well. However, when the Psalm ended, it also killed my<br/>
&gt; Troll friend&#39;s ultravision in Dark Elf mode. Weird bug. Psalm only does<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t seem to stack with some buffs, like the druid/<br/>
ranger&#39;s shield of bards or whatever it&#39;s called.<br/>
