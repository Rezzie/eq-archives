<div id="ygrps-yiv-343463800">nah i will get smoked =)  when the game came out my wife and i were both<br/>
playing shada (her in the day and me at night) so we got to 50 first (on our<br/>
server at least).  it will probably be only me this time around, so i may<br/>
never hit 60 =P<br/>
<br/>
and 10 hell levels is sounding very scary.<br/>
