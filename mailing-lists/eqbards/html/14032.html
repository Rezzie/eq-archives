<b>Subject:</b> Heads up regarding Harmonic Spear on EQCasters <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-972775549">I just wanted to point out that someone submitted bogus information to<br/>
EQ Casters site claiming Ariell of Combine has a Harmonic Spear and<br/>
providing the stats on it.<br/>
<br/>
I play Ariell Thunderwolf, a L50 Bard on the Karana server and am a<br/>
longtime member of the guild &quot;Combine&quot;. I do not possess a Harmonic<br/>
Spear, nor have I seen it or any of the quest items in Plane of Sky<br/>
required to obtain it yet. I have asked EQ Casters to remove this bogus<br/>
post. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused.<br/>

Ariell Thunderwolf, Karana</div>
