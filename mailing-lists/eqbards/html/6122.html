<div id="ygrps-yiv-325531179">Was in what some players call hell on norath, Cazic<br/>
Thule for most of the three day weekend.  And like a<br/>
good group we were waiting patiently for our turn for<br/>
good ole Mr. Tae.  Well group A is sitting on the<br/>
throne almost when he spawns so they jump him.  Some<br/>
one /shouts Tae and chaos insues.  Our group jumped in<br/>
the fray after group A&#39;s casters had dumped their<br/>
mana.  Not knowing if I had time to get charm off (not<br/>
to mention resist rates on yellows) I hit it with a<br/>
pixie strike.  It was below half health when our 1<br/>
caster unloaded.  We got the kill.  Not bad.  BTW I<br/>
love cazic, no place I have ever found where a bard is<br/>
so useful for crowd control.<br/>

So why is it called strike if they just fly around<br/>
your head?<br/>
