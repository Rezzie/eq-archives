<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032844681">I had the opportunity to Beta test DAoC.  I was impressed.<br/>
A lot of unique things in DAoC that you don&#39;t see in EQ but might wish you did.<br/>
<br/>
A few examples:<br/>
1.)  Equipment and Armor degrades as you use it.  If it degrades far enough<br/>
you&#39;ll have to run to town and get it &quot;refreshed&quot; to keep the stats up.<br/>
2.)  Any player can bind him/herself to any city/town/village bind point.<br/>
Commmand:  /bind<br/>
3.)  Seems to be a lot more low and midlevel quests for experience.  Every visit<br/>
to &quot;guild master&quot; presents a new quest.<br/>
<br/>
I started many characters in each of the realms to &quot;try&quot; them out, didn&#39;t get to<br/>
level many of them up very far.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all that comes to mind at the moment.  If you&#39;re playing feel free to<br/>
elaborate.<br/>
Still need to run out and get my copy of DAoC, Beta is over and I&#39;m cut off at<br/>
the moment.<br/>
