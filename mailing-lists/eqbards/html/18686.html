&gt;  Wisps are magic only to hit, but in a an all song <br/>
&gt; attack, that&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; a problem. (try to pick up magic gloves though so you can <br/>
&gt; punch the wisps)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Err, you&#39;re talking like mesh gloves right?  I thought only monks could use<br/>
those as magic attacks and that for the rest of us they were just a light<br/>
weight glove.  Am I wrong?<br/>
