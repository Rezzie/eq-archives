<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398118227">Hey all!<br/>
I am a level 28 bard on the Rallos Zek server.  I play some odd hours, wake up in the middle of the night and need my EQ fix etc. : ) I would love input into what I could possibly solo at my level.  I use a demon claw and a tomahawk as weapons, and seem to use bellow alot in fights.  Also keep in mind that since I am on PvP I can not use all songs the same way other bards do.  If anyone is around my non-party spells effect them and I hate to go around putting everyone to sleep all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
