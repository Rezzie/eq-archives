<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094789685">I have also seen a lot of silly, funny and stupid names on my server.<br/>
<br/>
Lets see:<br/>
<br/>
Candy Cane<br/>
<br/>
Allawannado Ishavsumfun<br/>
<br/>
There are more but I cannot think of them (didnt write them down).<br/>
<br/>
But we also have a paladin guildmate by the name of Arther Cloudchaser and,<br/>
we jokingly asked him if he was going to surname one of his alts (alts first<br/>
name is a variation on Arther) Fonzarelli.... Artherr Fonzarelli - I think<br/>
it&#39;s funny. I think if he does this I&#39;m going to ask him where Ritchie<br/>
Cunningham is.... *grin*<br/>
