<br/>
I am lvl 20 now, Yeah!  I bought the binding song 3 days ago.  I do not see<br/>
any slowness on the Mob at all in attack even though the text said that it<br/>
is bind.  I was wondering what songs all bards are using for outside<br/>
adventure: solo and group, and dungeons in group?  I find myself still using<br/>
the lvl 1, 7, and 12 song in combat.  I am using the lvl 7 song because<br/>
somehow I am the attention of the fight, hehe.  The other AE song is useless<br/>
in dungeons because you will attract too many MOB and most of our higher<br/>
song are AE.  So please inform me of what song you all use so I can be a<br/>
more effective bard in my group.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
