Raw bamboo works as a wind instrument?  Good to know.  When I first went to<br/>
Kunark, I made sure to have a couple extra drums and flutes in the bank.<br/>
Fortunately, I haven&#39;t died too much in Kunark, and when I do, I&#39;ve almost<br/>
always had a cleric nearby for a handy dandy rez.<br/>
<br/>
Are there any drum merchants in Kunark?  Can I quit cluttering up my bank<br/>
with instruments?</div>
