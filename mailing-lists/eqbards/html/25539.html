<div id="ygrps-yiv-2104766534">I was going solo at that level in EK.  I was doing the hymn-cod-bellow<br/>
twist.  At the time I was in bronze and banded, far from what level 16<br/>
equipment is these days.  So more times then not I would have to stop that<br/>
twist and kite them with selo and bellow.<br/>
<br/>
If I had it to do over again these days (now that there is Kunark and<br/>
Velious) I would probably go to Lake of Ill Omen.<br/>
