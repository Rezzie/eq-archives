<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243096231">Most of my current friends are actually pretty cool.  I just don&#39;t think<br/>
they understand bards despite all their exposure.  Except for Rylos of<br/>
course, he knows my pain.  Can&#39;t forget our Ranger/Druid&#39;s first description<br/>
of seeing someone physically playing a bard for the first time.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Holy S#$@!  You guys have to do that all the time???  That&#39;s ridiculous.&quot;<br/>
