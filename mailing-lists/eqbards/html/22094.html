Quick question on the subject of Clarity.  More rhetorical than anything, I<br/>
suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Why, oh why does every caster in creation call our most requested piece the<br/>
&quot;mana song&quot; yet they ask for Clarity by name from Enchanters?<br/>
<br/>
How about some professional courtesty here!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe then I won&#39;t feel so bad about mixing in the &quot;stopping you from dying&quot;<br/>
song or the &quot;make you hit a lil bit harder, a lil bit faster&quot; song.</div>
