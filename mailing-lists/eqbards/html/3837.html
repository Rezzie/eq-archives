&gt;Well in RL Fencing a riposte is the attack the follows a successful parry.<br/>
&gt;My guess it that in game it is a skill that will stop a blow and give you a<br/>
&gt;free attack against the attacker.<br/>

<br/>
You try to slash a borer beetle, but a borer beetle ripostes!<br/>
A Borer beetle tries to bite you, but you dodge!<br/>
<br/>
due to the timing, the attack came from the riposte</div>
