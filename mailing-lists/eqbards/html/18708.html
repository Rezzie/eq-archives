&gt; Also, another vague memory, I seem to remember that we need a magical <br/>
&gt; instrument equipped to hit magical creatures, not magical gloves.  I <br/>
&gt; could be wrong, but either way, it shouldn&#39;t be too hard to test... <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, the easiest magical string instrument to get is the <br/>
&gt; Lute of the Gypsy Princess or a Gypsy Lute.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A magical instrument  *or* magical gloves<br/>
<br/>
Trust me, magical gloves are a LOT easier to come by ;)<br/>
