<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576802670">Whats wrong with Lyssa&#39;s Concord?  Are they referring to the issue of it<br/>
negating ultravision if you are using the DE illusion from the Mask of<br/>
Deception?  If so then hopefully they will also fix this with the Psalms of<br/>
Cooling and Warmth.<br/>

Lyssa&#39;s Concord is confirmed and agreed as bug. The client programmer has it<br/>
now.</div>
