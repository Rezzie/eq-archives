<div id="ygrps-yiv-1870034755">hehe i did the same thing, Moon... But i was just thinking, as scary as it<br/>
may be... You know some quests are level dependent.. I was hailing anything<br/>
i could see at L52, I  haven&#39;t seen your level lately, but could it be 55 or<br/>
so is the minimum for the quest mobs to cough up more than a kind look? It<br/>
didn&#39;t occur to me while I was wandering about the plane, but this could be<br/>
something to consider. Who of our higher level non-kos&#39;d members here have<br/>
tried hailing things? Anyone 55+ by chance? Just some thoughts.</div>
