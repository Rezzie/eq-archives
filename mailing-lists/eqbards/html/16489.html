<div id="ygrps-yiv-392144298">Everyone that I have ever seen purport that Clouding works vs. undead seems to have 1 major misconception:<br/>
<br/>
All the undead in unrest except Barbed bones (and higher) are under level 20, which means they have green coward code affecting them.  You could, at level 30, walk around in unrest pretty much unperturbed by ANY of the undead simply because they won&#39;t attack you because you&#39;re so far above them in level.<br/>
<br/>
Just because an undead critter doesn&#39;t attack doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re invisible to them.  Try using clouding then CONNING the undead.  They still con as &#39;ready to attack&#39;.  Which means they can see you.  They just won&#39;t agg because you are higher level than them.<br/>
