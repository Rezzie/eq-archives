<div id="ygrps-yiv-792361758">Ack !!! I just found out my guild is going to take on the Hole in<br/>
Painheel tonight.<br/>
I understand a Bards Lock picking skill can be high enough to &quot;pick the<br/>
rocks&quot; and get in, so where can I go and get practice to get my skill up<br/>
?  and... what, just hold a pair of lock picks over the &quot;lock&quot; and start<br/>
using them ? Any advice is appreciated :) <br/>
 Thanks,<br/>
