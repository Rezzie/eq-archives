&gt; Good point, it would quite amusing seeing Troll and Ogre &quot;Musicians&quot; (not<br/>
&gt; bards).<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t see why Verant don&#39;t have evil bard types, musicians in battles<br/>
&gt; were used to raise troops moral and get a good marching beat, are Verant<br/>
&gt; saying that Trolls/Ogres don&#39;t go into war? </span></blockquote></div>
