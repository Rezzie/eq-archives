<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029715309">i think it is 75%.  i get +120 to resists with psalms (this singing increase<br/>
is almost certainly an oversight and will be fixed) and i think they do<br/>
upper 60s normally, so something like 68 to 120 is 75%.  good luck on the<br/>
scale.  all 3 times we killed gorenarire she had a scale, phew.  one for<br/>
each bard in the guild =)<br/>

&gt; instrument-tests I&#39;m <br/>
