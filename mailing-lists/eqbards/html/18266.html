&gt; My guild and I went to CoM this weekend as well but try as we<br/>
&gt; might we could<br/>
&gt; not find a key to the damn door.  Anyone have a clue what/who drops it?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
We used regular lockpicks though, didn&#39;t bother with the gnomish lockpicks.<br/>

Sylly, you should have a report on your guild page with more details (in<br/>
case the details I posted earlier weren&#39;t enough), one of my co-workers is a<br/>
druid in your guild.<br/>
