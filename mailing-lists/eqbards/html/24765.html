<div id="ygrps-yiv-372609433">After a ~6 Hour raid doing Juggs/Reets/Jumpy in the exp group, and an <br/>
additional ~4 hours in HS, I hit 60 a day earlier than I planned!<br/>
<br/>
148 days played.<br/>
43 or 44 when Kunark was released.<br/>
~80 days to 50.<br/>
Created first day of commercial.<br/>
<br/>
My fingers are tired. :)<br/>
