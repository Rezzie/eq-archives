<div id="ygrps-yiv-187433647"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Just<br/>
&gt; wondering what funky new stuff people have seen like Shadow <br/>
&gt; Men, mushrooms<br/>
&gt; and cabbages.  Also any changes that we, as bards should <br/>
&gt; watch out for.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, I read on Stratics that there are some new items being<br/>
foraged...has anyone foraged any of these new items yet?  I noticed there<br/>
were a lot of changes to graphics on items as well, for example, I had a<br/>
flowing black robe in the bank and when I went to get it yesterday night it<br/>
looked like a flowing black robe instead of that light blue bathrobe graphic<br/>
it used to have.  Lets be bardic and share some of our new discoveries.<br/>
