  Once you are levitating, the song will not take hold.  You have<br/>
  to fall first, before the next pulse will reactivate it.<br/>
<br/>
  Otherwise, yes, you get the:  You are already floating   message.<br/>
<br/>
  The song no longer refreshed itself, wtf wasnt that change in the<br/>
  patch message?  Because it&#39;s a nerf, that&#39;s why =)  This does not<br/>
  impact casters whatsoever, it&#39;s aimed at bard&#39;s who can levitate<br/>
  continously higher and higher.  I bet some plat thats the reason.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
