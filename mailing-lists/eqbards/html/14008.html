<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859944390">Since it looks like bard guild NPCs don&#39;t drop them, does anyone have an<br/>
idea on how we can go about finding these instruments? Should we just ask<br/>
Verant for a clue?<br/>

&gt; &gt;   attempt to break-in and rock the bard guild house.  See what<br/>
&gt; &gt;   turns up.  Has anyone done this yet?  I know it was suggested<br/>
&gt; &gt;   by someone else a while back.<br/>

&gt; Vigro (necro in mention) is in my guild.  He has hunted bards for a number<br/>
&gt; of levels now from Marsheart&#39;s Chords.  They drop regular mandolins.<br/>
