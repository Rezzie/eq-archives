<div id="ygrps-yiv-739478125">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Where would i go about finding combine weapons and/or magic weapons?<br/>
And another question, is a combine the same as a magic weapon?  I know<br/>
my friend can make me a magic sword, but it disappears after i log off<br/>
unless i stick it in the bank.  Any answer appreciated.  If long email<br/>
me directly please.<br/>
