    I have to have a chuckle..  I AM the proponent of the term &quot;riffing&quot; and speaking against using the term &quot;twisting&quot;<br/>
<br/>
    The tenor sax player (Kevin Kizer) from my (The Vanguard Aces http://www.vanguardaces.com)) also plays in another group (Ted Sirota&#39;s Rebel Souls) - they got &quot;Critic&#39;s Choice&quot; from the Chicago Reader reviewing their latest CD<br/>

<br/>
The critic said that Kevin has a &quot;tart twisty sound&quot;...  Made me think of this debate..<br/>
