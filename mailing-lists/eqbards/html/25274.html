<div id="ygrps-yiv-518645629"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Keep in mind, manasong, clarity, and other mana regen ...<br/>
&gt; things ... have no impact on the bards mana regen.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ummm... this is not quite true...<br/>
<br/>
While Gaelthorne is now retired (his player no longer playing EQ,) he <br/>
found out that singing &quot;I&#39;m a little teapot...&quot; while alternating <br/>
sitting and standing between pulses of manasong DID make his mana <br/>
regen increase.<br/>
<br/>
Could one of you test and see if this is still true?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be well,<br/>
