<b>Subject:</b> Dual wield tips and tricks, got any? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-291000035">I have finally made level 17 and got my dual wield.  Does anyone have<br/>
suggestions on how to raise the ability quickly?  . . . besides dumping<br/>
points in to it.  Possibly putting the fastest weapon in my second hand?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>
