<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778107472">Does anybody have any information on the rare spawn<br/>
wolf in Southern Ro called Scrounge?  I heard that he<br/>
drops the Scrounge Claw, which is 5 Dmg  30 Dly.  I<br/>
know that it isn&#39;t a great weapon, but it sure as hell<br/>
looks cool!!!  Looks like the Demon Claw (Thulian<br/>
Claw).  <br/>
<br/>
I would greatly appreciate any information on this, as<br/>
I am going to try and camp for this beast tonight.  I<br/>
hope he isn&#39;t above lvl 21, because then he will be<br/>
wearing a Sedaien Claw!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Sedaien Reyvon<br/>
lvl 21 bard of Solusek Ro<br/>
