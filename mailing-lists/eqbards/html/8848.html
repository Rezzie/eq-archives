<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557544711">Was Pixie Strike not working properly mentioned in the GZ letter?  Are bards<br/>
with the capability to sing this song submitting bug reports?  I assume some<br/>
of you have.  Perhaps if enough people submit a bug report it will get<br/>
fixed.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; It is not a random duration thing either.  The icon on your<br/>
&gt; screen disappears when the spell effect expires, whether it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; 1 second or 10 seconds.  But with the bug, the icon appears on<br/>
&gt; your screen and you get a message saying &quot;you are unstunned&quot;<br/>
&gt; when the icon disappears, despite never having been stunned to<br/>
&gt; begin with.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Try it on yourself before you argue otherwise.  I&#39;m not making<br/>
&gt; this up, I&#39;ve played with it extensively for the last week or<br/>
&gt; two.  It *is* broken.  This used to be my favorite song before<br/>
&gt; they broke it.  I don&#39;t even keep it loaded now.<br/>
