<div id="ygrps-yiv-79434629">Obviously - but it still doesn&#39;t account for that fact that deaths at 31<br/>
caused MUCH more xp lose than deaths at 29, 32, 33, and 34.  I haven&#39;t made<br/>
it to 37.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my guildmates are at about the same level as I am (or slightly<br/>
higher) and this seems to be the case for them as well...<br/>
<br/>
I just lost .75 bub dying at 36.  Happened at 31.  Never saw a death cause<br/>
that much xp loss at ANY other levels..<br/>
<br/>
Slyde in danger of losing 36...<br/>

&gt; Remember it takes 2-4 times the exp in the hell level.  You are losing the<br/>
&gt; same amount of exp, just looks like less because of the amount it takes to<br/>
&gt; gain a level.<br/>
