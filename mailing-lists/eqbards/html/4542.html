&gt;&gt; On that same note, does Hymn stack with a shaman&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; regeneration/chloroplast line?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I played with a shaman in Guk a few nights ago. He had to get out of range<br/>
&gt;of hymn or have me turn off hymn before he could use regen, but so long as<br/>
&gt;regen was cast while he was not affected by my song, when he got into range<br/>
&gt;he got his regen bonus and my mymn bonus.<br/>

list.<br/>
Nice to see it confirmed.  Regen has to be cast while hymn isn&#39;t in effect.<br/>
It&#39;s<br/>
probably best to assume the same for quickness/alacrity with regards to<br/>
anthem<br/>
et. al.</div>
