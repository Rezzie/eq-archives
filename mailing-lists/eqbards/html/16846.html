&gt; Hmm, how about a Kisch der Pavz?  Looks like a Long Sword and procs<br/>
&gt; Strong Poison.  There is also some shield available in Paw.  I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t found it yet, but I haven&#39;t given up hope.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  Thanks Rosha, I need to re-explore Paw since it changed, I&#39;ve only<br/>
  been in there a few times after the upgrade.  I&#39;ll look for that<br/>
  longsword and try to pickup a chitlin shield or just a plain shield.<br/>
