<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430102831">What I wanna know is how come all the so-called good stuff in this game is<br/>
broken???<br/>
<br/>
All the hot items are ruined, jagged, cracked, dusty, tainted, or<br/>
bloodstained!!  What gives??<br/>
<br/>
Sylly<br/>
<br/>
p.s. is there anywhere we can take this stuff to get it fixed and cleaned???<br/>
I got a shield that would ROCK if I can get the damn crack fixed!</div>
