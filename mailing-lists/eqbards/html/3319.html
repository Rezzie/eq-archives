<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273838611">As of yet I have seen absolutely no effect with the Lute of the Gypsy<br/>
Princess over a regular lute, save that it could sell to the vendor for<br/>
4.5 pp. However, it may take a higher level for it to be effective (much<br/>
like the proc on a Screaming Mace not working for low level characters),<br/>
or perhaps it only works for songs like Lament? That can be rather<br/>
difficult to check. We&#39;ll have to get John one so he can check though,<br/>
his tests are always alot more detailed then anything I do. =)<br/>
