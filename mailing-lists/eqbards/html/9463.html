&gt; Anyone have any recent experience with lullaby?  I was looking at the song<br/>

&gt; About a week back my party got ambushed in East Karana by a bunch of spirit<br/>
&gt; stalkers while my party was engaging undead reavers (3 of them).  I struck<br/>
&gt; up lullaby with my lute and sure enough, I got 10 head nods messages (7<br/>
&gt; stalkers and all 3 undead reavers).  There was so much chaos so I&#39;m not sure<br/>
&gt; if it took or not, but it at least allowed us enough freedom to dispatch of<br/>
&gt; the gnolls and then eventually the stalkers.  I definitely felt like more<br/>
&gt; then 4 were really sleeping...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, Goatanos&#39; song analysis was wrong on this point.  I&#39;ve<br/>
successfully nodded (i.e. survived) 12 at once.  I&#39;ve<br/>
unsuccessfully done 15 trying to hold them so my party could<br/>
get away.  It definitely takes as my party ran off with only 3<br/>
or 4 mobs chasing them, the other 11 or 12 stayed around with<br/>
me.<br/>

There *is* a limit of 4 mobs that can be attacking you at any<br/>
one time (might&#39;ve been lowered to 3, didn&#39;t really watch<br/>
closely this weekend).  If more than 4 aggro on you, the rest<br/>
will just ignore you until one of the original 4 dies.  So if<br/>
you&#39;re using an AE song, it can seem like it&#39;s only affecting<br/>
4 at a time.  Just position yourself better so everything is<br/>
affected.<br/>
