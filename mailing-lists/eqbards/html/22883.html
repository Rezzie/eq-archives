Subject: [eqbards] Special Request: Plane of Mischief<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Can y&#39;all keep an eye out for PoM stuff, and send it my way?  That&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; only thing about Velious that I&#39;m interested in at this point.  Big fan of<br/>
&gt; Bristlebane that I am, I always thought that Halflings (the big &quot;B&quot;&#39;s<br/>
&gt; favoured race) should be able to be Bards ;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
