<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735465022">I have the Basalt Carapace and a Lambent Stone and was<br/>
going to enlist the help of my guild to procure the<br/>
Lute.  What composition and levels would be necessary<br/>
to accomplish this?  My guild is made up of mostly hi<br/>
30&#39;s low 40&#39;s rangers, warriors, with a few necros<br/>
enchanters and wizards as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
