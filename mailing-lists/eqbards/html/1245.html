<div id="ygrps-yiv-665480171">The Level 15 Song (Lullaby) works just like a stun when used in mele<br/>
combat. It doesn&#39;t start working wel until well after Level 15, but once it<br/>
starts working, it is very nice.<br/>

&gt;that causes a stun - nothing else, just a stun.  Kind of a &quot;Bash&quot; for<br/>
