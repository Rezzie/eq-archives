<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069425052">that&#39;s what I thought.  The problem I encountered with mine was that one lag<br/>
spike or disappearing mob and you died, period.  They just don&#39;t have the<br/>
hp&#39;s to survive getting caught by one of the charmee&#39;s I found.  Our regular<br/>
enchanter in the Armigers had even less luck charming than I did, probably<br/>
due to not having to deal with it on a 12 second basis before ;-)<br/>
