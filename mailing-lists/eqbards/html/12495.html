<div id="ygrps-yiv-225685111">Q: What song do I get at &lt;foo&gt; level?  What does this song do?<br/>
<br/>
  This cracks me up everytime I read it.  I am an elite foo bard.<br/>
  At foo level you are like a god, so it really doesnt matter what<br/>
  the song does.<br/>
<br/>
  Speaking of songs, someone told me at the Game Convention where<br/>
  Verant released the expansion preview, they were showing the new<br/>
  bard songs.  One song, deemed L75 or so, was a song that stopped<br/>
  time in a zone.  Every second of time stop drained mana, but in<br/>
  the duration, all NPCs would freeze.  Man, that would rock.<br/>
<br/>
  Harm.</div>
