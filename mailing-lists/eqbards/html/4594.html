<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020178384">I must agree that the story was great.  And timely too.  Last night I<br/>
ventured into Mistmoore for the first time with my ranger and druid friend.<br/>
 Luckily we were camoflauged.  Everything was a screaming red to me at 14.<br/>
We left posthaste, hoping that the friendly-scary skeleton at the doorway<br/>
wouldn&#39;t see through our camoflauge.<br/>

Hehe.<br/>
