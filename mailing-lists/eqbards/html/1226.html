<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601378561">I am a wood elf bard with a bronze helm, and it is my favorite possesion! I<br/>
love the way it looks, and it constantly attracts tons of attention and<br/>
compliments . . . I wonder if we are talking about a different helm? Can&#39;t<br/>
imagine anyone not liking the way mine looks . . . <br/>
