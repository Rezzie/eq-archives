&gt; Greeting fellow Bards,<br/>
&gt; I was under the impression that the Antimagic Song was an AOE or party only <br/>
&gt; that prevented harmful spells from being cast on the party by any attacking <br/>
&gt; mobs. I watched my husband and his group in beta attack the Karanas Ogre <br/>
&gt; camp and they specifically had a L40+ bard to sing this song to prevent <br/>
&gt; members from being charmed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm. I was in P4 beta and there were no songs over L20 on the vendors<br/>
until the second last day. Are you sure about this? I&#39;d be more inclined<br/>
to think the bard was playing a magic resist song.<br/>
