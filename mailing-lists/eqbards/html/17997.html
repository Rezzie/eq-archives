<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-107525788">I know we have covered this before but I have been looking for a while and<br/>
can&#39;t find the thread. I am looking for Highpass Keep strategies (at level<br/>
27). I seem to recall Area Effect songs are okay...and if nothing else if<br/>
that is false I would appreciate a heads up :o)<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>
