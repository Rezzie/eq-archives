&gt; As an aside... On the &quot;Concert Hall&quot; message board, a fellow <br/>
&gt; bard attempted<br/>
&gt; to complete the quest for the Lambent Breastplate (the one <br/>
&gt; the requires the<br/>
&gt; lute and the carapace?).  Anyway, he forked over his Lute, <br/>
&gt; carapace and<br/>
&gt; required stone, and got absolutely nothing in return.  Either <br/>
&gt; the quest is<br/>
&gt; broken, or the Lute of the Gypsy Princess is NOT the correct <br/>
&gt; lute to use.<br/>
