<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276303424"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;i think what he was saying is that mistmoore raises your faction with<br/>
&gt;the league of antonican bards (in qeynos) and will not help give you<br/>
&gt;better prices if you are selling in kelethin bards guild... right?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i guess i misunderstood the question, i thought the guy originally said <br/>
there was no way to raise bard faction as far as he knew.  i was just saying <br/>
that there was a way to raise some bard faction, besides quests.</div>
