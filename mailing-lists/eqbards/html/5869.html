<div id="ygrps-yiv-302683132">I played for a while at lunch (got level 26!  YAY!) and I&#39;d have to agree<br/>
with whoever posted that the resist rates have gone up.  I was fighting<br/>
blue gobs in Perma, and they were resisting my chains 3 out of 4 attempts.<br/>
They were resisting discord 1 out of 2 attempts.  This has NEVER happend<br/>
before.  I have been playing in perma for the last week, and this is a<br/>
definite change.  This was BEFORE I got my level btw, just to remove any<br/>
excess variables.<br/>
