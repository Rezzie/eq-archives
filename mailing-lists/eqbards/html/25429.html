<div id="ygrps-yiv-56231706">This weekend my guild decided to try out Naggy with alts on friday so we<br/>
could get our hands on another rez stick afterwards.  we got him, he dropped<br/>
a CoF and 2 9/25 piercers. Then we waited for rage, and waited, and waited<br/>
some more, finally on sunday Rage showed up, and dropped 3 red scales woot.<br/>
I log out afterwards cause had to go out of town for a few hours.  When I<br/>
log in later, they&#39;re buffing up for Gore, so I got there asap and I got my<br/>
white scale from her!  I&#39;m in utter shock, got my 2 scales on the same day,<br/>
now its just a matter of time before phinny drops his spine for me. Just<br/>
wanted to share my luck 8)<br/>
