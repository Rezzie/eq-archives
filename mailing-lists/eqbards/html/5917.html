<div id="ygrps-yiv-989512290">The only thing I&#39;ve noticed is that rarely when I forage I&#39;ll get no item,<br/>
and no failure message either. Perhaps those are the times when I&#39;m supposed<br/>
to be foraging something ELSE, but it is only half implemented? A friend of<br/>
mine said that he noticed this lack of message bug usually while in Greater<br/>
Faydark. (I had just thought it was a lag thing or some minor bug before.)<br/>

I have a druid, and I forage constantly with her.  I have also noticed this, <br/>
but it happens at least once in every zone she goes to.<br/>
