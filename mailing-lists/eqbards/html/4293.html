<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209870807">I am assuming they are not implemented yet, as in a patch last month they<br/>
added level 43 and 50 songs, and previously they added the fufil&#39;s and<br/>
tuyen&#39;s songs.  Plus songs that high level would probably be quests that<br/>
would not give a &quot;too experienced&quot; message.  My guess is they will be on<br/>
vendors in later patches (when dammit?!?! hehehe)<br/>

&gt; The lvl 39, 45, 47, and 49 songs are not sold by the bard <br/>
&gt; vendors as we all<br/>
&gt; know. What i wanted to find out is if they are just not <br/>
&gt; implemented or are<br/>
&gt; they a quest item? I tried to do several bard quests that seemed like<br/>
&gt; likely targets and got the &#39;You are too experienced for this <br/>
&gt; quest&#39; thingee. <br/>
