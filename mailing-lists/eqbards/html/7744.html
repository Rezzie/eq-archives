&gt;borken classes in the game, I think the chances of much change to gate<br/>
&gt;and bind are pretty non-existant. All Verant seems to do for class<br/>
&gt;balance now is take things away from other classes, not add things,<br/>
&gt;unless it&#39;s the Ranger, where a supposed typo had some of their combat<br/>
&gt;values set lower than supposedly they were supposed to be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not exactly true, they added a few things to warriors a while back, and are<br/>
looking at weapon&#39;s specialization for them also<br/>
