<b>Subject:</b> Utility of flute with charm/pixie (was Char Catillion) <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989900439">Is that confirmed by testing or a subjective theory?  I always equip my<br/>
flute when I want to improve my chances of getting a charm or pixie strike<br/>
to stick.  First time I think I&#39;ve seen a post that said the flute didn&#39;t<br/>
help with charm or pixie.  <br/>
<br/>
In all honesty, I wouldn&#39;t be too upset if it was true.  That would allow me<br/>
to keep my weapons or other instruments equipped when I&#39;m trying to charm or<br/>
pixie instead of switching back and forth.  Also frees up one of my main<br/>
inventory slots since I can just keep the flute in a bag.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;   As with all of our other wind based songs, the flute is utterly<br/>
&gt;   useless unless it&#39;s required (invisiblility).  Using a flute for<br/>
&gt;   our other songs doesn&#39;t do anything.  Charm, Pixie, Charisma,<br/>
&gt;   WaterBreathing, no duration improvement, resist lessening, or<br/>
&gt;   statistical adjustment can be noticed.  Which is sad, and probably<br/>
&gt;   explains why my Darkwood Piccolo has no stats.<br/>
