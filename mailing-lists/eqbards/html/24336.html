Since you seem to have apparently logged much more post-patch Hate time<br/>
than I have, maybe you can shine some light on a few questions i&#39;ve been<br/>
having.<br/>
1, Now that you have the basic stuff down, roughly how long does Hate take<br/>
to clear now?  I remember per patch people used to do planes in about 4 - 8<br/>
or so hours, baring problems.  Due to pathing and such now, im curious how<br/>
much longer poh will take on average.<br/>
2. Have you come to a conclusion what the spawn time on the 2nd floor mobs<br/>
are?  12hrs same as level 1? Mini-bosses 24?  less? more?<br/>
3. Have you found a trash can to store all those ceramonial robes?  :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
