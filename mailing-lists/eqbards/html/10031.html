<div id="ygrps-yiv-908403622">I always thought the reference to the bard as jack of all<br/>
trades was that we were part melee, part caster, part<br/>
utility.  If you look at the skills available to the classes:<br/>

<br/>
it&#39;s pretty clear our skill set is not encompassing,<br/>
comprising a few of the rogue skills with a couple others<br/>
thrown in.<br/>
<br/>
What might be interesting is if someone could add up the skill<br/>
caps for all the skills for all the classes (subtracting<br/>
&quot;required&quot; skills like combat skills, casting skills, music<br/>
skills).<br/>
