<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-335017199">My fellow coworkers and I were standing around talking EQ (which we<br/>
unfortunately do too often) and the subject of research came up.  (My boss<br/>
is a wizard)  I thought to myself wouldn&#39;t that be great, to be able to<br/>
research new songs.  Well, then I thought to myself, that isnt really<br/>
practical because no one would &quot;research&quot; a song.  But then I thought<br/>
wouldnt it be even better if we bards could do our own form of research in<br/>
songwriting.  Of course we couldnt just write a song a then be done.  What<br/>
if we could do musical research and put components together to make new<br/>
songs.  After all, wouldn&#39;t real bards write their own songs?  What do you<br/>
think?<br/>
