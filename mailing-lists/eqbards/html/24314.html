<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; They appear to have bumped the Dual Wield cap in the patch in <br/>
&gt; which they alleged that they were raising<br/>
&gt; the Defense cap.  Every Bard I know has seen Dual Wield go up <br/>
&gt; a lot.  I THINK I saw one Defense raise, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not positive.<br/>
