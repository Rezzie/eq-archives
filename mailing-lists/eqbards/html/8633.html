<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt;I&#39;ve tried to follow this thread - but it&#39;s overly laden with acronyms -<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;YES I did check the Everquest Glossary before posting...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My only question is &quot;So what?&quot;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; would you have rather that i wrote it in kerrouacian style using the<br/>
&gt; streaming consciousness format devoid of punctuation and other defining<br/>
&gt; qualities as On the Road was originally penned and just rambled on in a<br/>
&gt; continuous stream of thought we are bards for cry eye so we make <br/>
&gt; it a little<br/>
&gt; flowery whats the big deal<br/>
