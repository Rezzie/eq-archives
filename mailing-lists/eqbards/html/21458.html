<div id="ygrps-yiv-869166608">Well as usuall absolutely nothing for bards other then perhaps trade skills (cough cough) and maybe the weapon?  Place your bets anyone REALLY think we got a bard weapon? I bet the Lambent weapon isn&#39;t even in the game yet and that&#39;s supposed to be mid level.<br/>

&gt; We are pleased to announce that we have implemented new &quot;Fiery<br/>
&gt; Avenger&quot; style quests for every class in the game (including<br/>
&gt; paladins).  The ultimate reward for each quest boasts a custom model<br/>
