<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026135105">so far the only pieces found are gloves, boots, and legs.  there is only one<br/>
set of legs (on any server) because we were able to kill venril sathir<br/>
before he was buffed incredibly (apparently he is a quest npc and not to be<br/>
killed), and now his loot table is most likely empty.  so we have gloves and<br/>
boots.  every other class with kunark armor has found one or all of the<br/>
following, and this includes druid, ranger, shadow knight, paladin, warrior,<br/>
rogue, shaman, cleric: arms, helm, bracer.  none of these have been found in<br/>
singing steel.  i refuse to believe they have not been found yet.  every<br/>
other class with armor in kunark has found these pieces!  maybe bards get<br/>
lucky and our pieces are so incredible they are found only in veeshan&#39;s peak<br/>
(laugh).  so what i think is that once again, like imbrued armor in hate,<br/>
bard armor has been forgotten to be placed in kunark.  anyone who is more<br/>
familiar and versed want to ask on the gameplay forum?  or am i wrong?<br/>
