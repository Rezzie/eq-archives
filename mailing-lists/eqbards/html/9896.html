<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807103804">I don&#39;t necessarily want to track as good as a ranger, or forage - but I<br/>
WOULD like to be able to have the thing be useful.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My track capped out at 100 i believe. and i find it very very useful. <br/>
especially in Solb when there are 40 - 50 people there. I can find that dog <br/>
that just spawned before other people.  :)<br/>
