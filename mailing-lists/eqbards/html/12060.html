&gt;   Nor will they ever, if I see a druid/cleric/shaman meleeing<br/>
&gt;   I tell them to sit their ass down.  They have no business<br/>
&gt;   swinging for an average 10dmg per round.  More often than<br/>
&gt;   not, I dont have every buff or am completely healed, so I&#39;d<br/>
&gt;   rather them perform the job we hired them for then attempt<br/>
&gt;   to melee.  In my own immortal words:<br/>

harassing him to get him trained, now he does what he&#39;s supposed to do. :)<br/>
