Hello all,<br/>
Bard&#39;s currently have 2 songs that use mana, DDD being one of them, <br/>
and it uses a *lot* of mana. We figure that there are probably a few <br/>
bards out there who can cast 2 of these, but not many. <br/>
<br/>
Since nothing that regens mana will help bards, and they only get <br/>
1pt/tick back, it takes a LONG time for them to recover from singing <br/>
this song. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve recently acquired the ability to place a song-specific recast <br/>
time on the songs. We&#39;re considering replacing the mana requirement <br/>
on the song with a 15 minute re-sing time. <br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?<br/>
