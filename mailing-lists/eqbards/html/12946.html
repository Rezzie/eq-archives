<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149789991">To answer someone&#39;s question, if Pixie Strike has a base 33%<br/>
chance of being resisted, and an immediate 33% chance of a<br/>
secondary resist, then it in effect has a 55% chance of being<br/>
resisted (45% chance of succeeding).<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s working the way I suspect it is (base resist check,<br/>
level-based resist check, and immediate break-out resist<br/>
check), at 33% chance to resist across the board, you only<br/>
have a 30% chance of getting it to stick.<br/>
