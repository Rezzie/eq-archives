<div id="ygrps-yiv-642743786">I am lvl 33 bard.  I need advice on weapons.<br/>
<br/>
I have a <br/>
<br/>
writhing staff<br/>
barbed whip<br/>
black enamel Mace<br/>
Dragoon Dirk<br/>
Silver axe<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking of getting a crystalline blade and an obsidian shard.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering which 2 weapons out of the 7 do you all think is best to<br/>
use?<br/>
<br/>
