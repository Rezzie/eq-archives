<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904763009"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Something to add, based on my preliminary tests - Chains will <br/>
&gt;override all (?) other movement spells, but the previous spells <br/>
&gt;icon remains on the screen, which means until it is dispelled/ends/etc, <br/>
&gt;you can&#39;t selo, only move at normal speed.  I didn&#39;t test this with all <br/>
&gt;the spells, but its definately a case of removing a snare with chains - <br/>
&gt;the snare icon remains, and selos has no effect...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can confirm this.  With SOW on and a long run from North Karana to <br/>
Qeynos ahead of me, I decided to try to eliminate SOW in some fashion.<br/>
<br/>
I chained myself, yet the SOW icon remained.  After chains wore off,<br/>
I was moving _normal_ speed, although SOW should have been active.<br/>
Trying Selo&#39;s at that point did absolutely nothing.<br/>
<br/>
WARNING...  do not chain yourself to remove SOW, you will only go<br/>
a hell of a lot slower =)<br/>
