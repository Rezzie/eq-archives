&lt;&lt; You said your STR was 87, 17 above the baseline.  You should have put more<br/>
 of your starting 25 into STR, but we can&#39;t change that now.  To carry the<br/>
 Bronze, you need to get some +STR items.  Buy some +3 STR rings.  You can<br/>
 get a Purity Belt (+2 STR) for under 5pp.  You also may want to consider<br/>
 the Cracked Darkwood Shield (+9STR).  There are many more items to choose<br/>
 from &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One good one is the spiked leather collar, very cheap and +3 str. Ive got a <br/>
38 palidan friend that still wears one :P</div>
