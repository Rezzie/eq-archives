you seem to be one of the most experienced of our brothers here, and i<br/>
would like you expert opinion on something.  while juggling songs i<br/>
have noticed that my hit percentage goes down.  yes i have tested it<br/>
but have no exact numbers.  when i juggle i hit less frequently, when i<br/>
sing one i hit more often.  maybe it is due to concentration needed on<br/>
the character&#39;s part? any observations are welcome.  also some posts<br/>
from yesterday mentioned that they didn&#39;t think the drum was usefull<br/>
till level 7.  accelerando is level 5 and the drum is extremely<br/>
beneficial to this song.  thank you for your time brother.<br/>
