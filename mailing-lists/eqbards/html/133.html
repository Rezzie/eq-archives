<div id="ygrps-yiv-776069654">Actually this is not totally right. There are 2 quests in qeynos, and<br/>
one in kelethin(best in the game for what you get/what it takes to do).<br/>
Freeport does seem to be a little absent for bard&#39;s quests though.<br/>
Remember also that other guilds do let you do their quests. I&#39;ve done<br/>
several warrior guild, cleric guild, and paladin guild quests in several<br/>
cities. Check all over, especially in qeynos(and surefall) as it has the<br/>
most quests(I know of) for any city.</div>
