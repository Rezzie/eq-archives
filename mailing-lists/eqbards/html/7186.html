&gt;Ok, Ok, there are several things missing in EQ, but more that anything<br/>
&gt;else is this: <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;	A list of spells and what they do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Am I the only one who noticed and is frustrated by this? Bards seem to<br/>
&gt;be affect less by this than other classes, but they are still affected. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, if nothing else, it certainly gives us a reason to have websites ;)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, due to the constant upgrading of spells, changing of<br/>
levels, effects and names, it&#39;s a good thing that Verant never did create a<br/>
&quot;spellbook&quot; - it would have been outdated 1 week after it was written.<br/>
<br/>
Then again - perhaps that is the problem?<br/>
<br/>
But at least there ARE numerous very handy websites out there - check the<br/>
FAQ for a couple of Bard-related ones, and if you want a pure-spellcaster<br/>
site, try Baelish&#39;s: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://eq.castersrealm.com/">http://eq.castersrealm.com/</a><br/>
