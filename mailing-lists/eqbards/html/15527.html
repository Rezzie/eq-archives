&gt;This is unrelated to this particular problem, but I&#39;d recommend that you<br/>
&gt;remove &quot;Fast Find&quot; from your startup folder in Windows.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This little program, installed mostly by default by MS Office, searches your<br/>
&gt;drives and can cause heavy disk activity at the most inconvenient times. But<br/>
&gt;like I said, I&#39;m sure this is *not* the cause in this case, but I always<br/>
&gt;make sure this program never gets loaded on my computers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh - and FYI, don&#39;t try to burn disks in the background while you&#39;re <br/>
playing.... That can cause... a few problems.<br/>
<br/>
*chuckles*<br/>
But what&#39;s really interesting is that the noises from that program can <br/>
still be heard, despite the wolf howls and spell sounds...<br/>
