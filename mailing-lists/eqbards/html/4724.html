<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050659640">You did better than me - my base is 75 str and with all the visible bronze<br/>
(except boots) I am very close to being encumbered.  Even with some str<br/>
boosters - which I am trying to get all of them that I can.  You can play<br/>
Anthem for a str boost - and beg for str buffs.  But it&#39;s constantly on your<br/>
mind.<br/>
<br/>
So - you are prolly ok but it will still be an issue.<br/>
<br/>
More important though is having high str for dmg boosts which come after<br/>
level 20.  So, aside from the weight factor - everyone is still after str<br/>
boosts - for the dmg benefits.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion - you&#39;re better balanced than me. And I do ok. Not great on dmg<br/>
but ok.<br/>

		I have a base strength of 85.  I took 85 because a friend of<br/>
mine is a high<br/>
		elf paladin and seems to be able to wear bronze.  I am a<br/>
half elf and<br/>
		figured 85 strength would be plenty since you can get<br/>
+strength items if<br/>
		need be.  Did I make a mistake?<br/>
