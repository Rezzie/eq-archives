&gt;supposedly nodding its head - when no one else has hit it. I know this may<br/>
&gt;be as a result of a DOT spell cast on it... but I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt;soloing and have been attacked by something that just nodded its head, with<br/>
&gt;no one else around. Anyone experienced this? If it fails I&#39;m cool with<br/>
&gt;that, but if it succeeds it *should* work... no?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Simple answer to that one really.... lag. The mob actually hit you before <br/>
your song took effect, you just didn&#39;t see it till much later. A lot like <br/>
the effect I see a lot of: a mob hitting me or me hitting a mob long after I <br/>
see it laying there dead.<br/>
