<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423085403">Anyone else experience this - judging by postings on the tech boards - there<br/>
are quite a few others.<br/>
<br/>
Post-patch I get 1.5 second pauses every 5-10 seconds or so.  If I kill of<br/>
EVERY background program (except my firewall - can&#39;t live without that) - it<br/>
helps - so that the pauses are 1 second ever 15-20 - but it&#39;s still there...<br/>
<br/>
I have a high end system (Athlon 800, Geforce2 GTS) - so it&#39;s clearly not a<br/>
performance issue.  Also - turning off sound, and setting display options to<br/>
the minimum make no difference whatsoever...<br/>
