<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019640665">The COB would stack when I wasn&#39;t fighting.  Also the casters (who did<br/>
not have quickness) were not getting the COB effect.  I tried bellow,<br/>
but had the first 10 resisted completly, so I put it away.  Avocets are<br/>
likely out of that magic 6? level range for me as I think they are 28-30<br/>
and I am 21.<br/>
