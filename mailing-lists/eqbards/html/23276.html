<div id="ygrps-yiv-612253105">I sent my analysis of the percent difference the new xp system makes.  In<br/>
Karnors (a dungeon that did not get bumbed)the highest increase you are<br/>
looking at is about 20%.  Perhaps you were just in a really good group.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; I played in Karnors last night with a warrior, cleric, monk, and<br/>
&gt; ranger... all I have to say is I earned as much exp in the two hours<br/>
&gt; I was there last night as I had in 6+ hour camps before (and the<br/>
&gt; group was not any better.) </span></blockquote></div>
