VS<br/>
A source tells me that VS is a quest mob. He was not supposed to have a drop<br/>
table. With that in mind as soon as some one finds another way to destroy<br/>
him there probably won&#39;t be any loot and he will be enhanced once more after<br/>
its discovered. The mob was not made to be destroyed, Sirran the Lunitic<br/>
comes to mind.<br/>
