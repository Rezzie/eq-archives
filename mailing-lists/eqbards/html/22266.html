<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080216213">I don&#39;t mind the self only thing... that&#39;s fine.  My only question is <br/>
this...  Does the haste of these songs improve?  I mean, otherwise <br/>
they would be worthless upgrades, right?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, how lovely :).<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; OK, am I confused or did Twilight already work at any time of <br/>
&gt; &gt; day?  Also, I noticed that Caster&#39;s Realm says Twilight <br/>
&gt; &gt; pushes the mobs, rather than pulls them ;P.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And this means Jonthan&#39;s Provocation is now self-only, yes?<br/>
