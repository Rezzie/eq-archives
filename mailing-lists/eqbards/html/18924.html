Kunark would be even more inconvenient than Lavastorm.<br/>
<br/>
However, there is Kurn&#39;s Tower. There are lower level things in Lake of Ill<br/>
Omen. There is the bone pit in Field of Bones, and a whole range of<br/>
things in the Swamp of No Hope. Basically, you want to go to where the<br/>
Iskar are growing up.<br/>

&gt;I was just wondering if there was anyplace in Kunark where those <br/>
&gt;around Level 13 could hunt. Oasis is always crowded, and a lot of <br/>
&gt;other places are inconvienent (Lavastorm). <br/>
