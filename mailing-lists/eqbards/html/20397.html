<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115135468">I would forget about your chant for a little while, if your experience is<br/>
anything like mine was--I had so many resists for at *least* the first<br/>
level that it was the song equivalent of dead weight.  I actually did not<br/>
use it until I had two chants under my belt, so I could equip the drum<br/>
and really *do* something with my DoTs, but that is just me.<br/>
