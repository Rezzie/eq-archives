&gt; &gt;Genni is definately in the temple, I don&#39;t remember the<br/>
&gt; &gt;location, but I was able to deal with him.  He&#39;s in a seperate<br/>
&gt; &gt;location from the bards.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SHE is on the third floor next to Ostorm.  She sometimes<br/>
&gt; roams around tho.  Has anyone else noticed that the keepers<br/>
&gt; change race/sex fairly often?  Freaky.  Maybe they just<br/>
&gt; rotate around the Temple.  Genni definitely stays female<br/>
&gt; erudite. =)<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm.  I&#39;ve spent about 2 hours looking for Genni, both times with other<br/>
bards there as well, and none of us found Genni on Karana.  <br/>
<br/>
Apparently, she CAN be tracked, but nobody has found her through<br/>
tracking either.<br/>
<br/>
She wasn&#39;t near Ostorm either.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m just really dumb, but more likely she&#39;s stuck in a wall or<br/>
something on Karana.  Hrm.  <br/>
