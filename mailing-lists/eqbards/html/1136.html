<b>Subject:</b> Why on 40 on the Forage <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521928107">Hello, my fellow soloists    <br/>
I have a bone to pick with Verant.  Why give us the ability to forage if the skill cap is 40.  The whole point for foraging is that it can take the place of buying food.  So you can rely on it to meet all you dietary needs.  I am a lvl 14 bard and my forage is maxed.  I use it constantly and very rarely do i ever get any rewards for my persistence.  I say we all ban together and e-mail Verant demanding they increase the skill lvl.  I mean why not, it&#39;s not like we can use the skill to make any money at it... LETS BAND TOGETHER FELLOW BARDS AND DEMAND VERANT TO ADD THIS TO THE NEXT PATCH.....    <br/>

Sing loud and proud fellow bards...</div>
