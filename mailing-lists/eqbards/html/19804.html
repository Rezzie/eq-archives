is wearing off it&#39;s icon won&#39;t flash.  If you are not playing a song (ie:<br/>
have no song effects active) your icons will flash before fading.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;re right about this.  If my Illusion: Dark Elf starts to<br/>
fade while I&#39;m singing, the Illusion icon doesn&#39;t flash.  However, if I&#39;m<br/>
not singing, it&#39;ll flash for a few seconds before fading.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t really bother me, though, since I take more notice of the<br/>
messages in the text box than what icons I&#39;ve got active.<br/>
