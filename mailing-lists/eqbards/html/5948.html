<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992944660">At 03:40 PM 9/1/99 -0500,  &quot;Bobby&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:merlin26@...">merlin26@...</a>&gt; sent out a message,<br/>
unknowingly, with the happy99.exe worm attached.  This is a WORM program -<br/>
similar to a virus. Do NOT open it, or your computer will become infected.<br/>
<br/>
If you have already opened the attached exe file, and seen the pretty<br/>
fireworks, it&#39;s too late.  Go to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/happy99.worm.html">http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/happy99.worm.html</a> to find<br/>
instructions on manual removal.  For those of you willing to trust<br/>
downloading from the internet, there is an automatic removal program called<br/>
Happy99 Cleaner.  Since I work in the computer business, and since I design<br/>
the website, I have made this program available to my clients.  Go here to<br/>
download it:<br/>

<br/>
If I had the ability to block attachments, believe me, I would :P  In the<br/>
meantime DON&#39;T open ANYTHING if you don&#39;t know what it is, and for<br/>
Bristlebane&#39;s sake, get a virus checker!!! (Norton worked on this one, and<br/>
HOW!  Darned near locked my computer telling me about it!)<br/>
<br/>
I am blocking Bobby from further posts until he has assured me that his<br/>
computer is clean.<br/>
<br/>
In Service,<br/>
