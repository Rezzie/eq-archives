<div id="ygrps-yiv-743839294">Was curious what these are going for around Norrath as I acquired one from<br/>
that little bugger Dvinn last night, and yes was actually accused of kill<br/>
stealing by a warrior???  <br/>
He asks for help, a dozen or so people happily dive in, 9 or 10 of them die<br/>
and only he and I survive.  And he couldn&#39;t keep up in damage with me?  It<br/>
was all too crazy to follow but I suspect he yelled for help, then ducked<br/>
and hid while others croaked and tried to jump in once there were only a few<br/>
people left and Dvinn was badly hurt.  Since I was bellowing Dvinn didn&#39;t<br/>
get around to me until there were just the two of us and I outlasted him by<br/>
a bubble. Hah, my four bubbles evaporated ridding him of his last half a<br/>
bubble.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, what are these things selling for?  I may keep it as a memento but I<br/>
really hate the way a dagger looks in your hands, a spear or scimitar is so<br/>
much more intimidating.  It is pretty cool though.<br/>
