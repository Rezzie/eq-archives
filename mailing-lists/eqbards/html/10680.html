  Your chains wont matter, your charm doesnt work anymore, pixie<br/>
  strike doesnt hold monsters well enough, you are like a mosquito<br/>
  pricking the enemy with your tiny axe and dirk, and people will  <br/>
  say &quot;why am I going beserk - what is a burst of strength/speed?&quot;<br/>
  Lullaby?  Damn, I forgot I even had that... what level was it again?<br/>
  <br/>
  You will be reduced to nothing but a L32 bard with your manasong =)<br/>
<br/>
	Heh heh, I forgot about that Harmonic, our charm only works for 8<br/>
levels cause you can&#39;t charm anything over 35th level right?  Remind me not<br/>
to get used to that song in a couple months.<br/>
