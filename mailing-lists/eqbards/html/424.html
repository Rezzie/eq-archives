<br/>
I think about buying my first magical weapon right now and wanted to know<br/>
what kind of 1HS combine weapons do exist in the game. I&#39;ve just heard about<br/>
a combine longsword which you can buy at the gipsy camps. Are there other<br/>
combine weapons, maybe with better stats than the longsword? I just dont<br/>
wanna pay all my money for a combine longsword just to hear 1 day later that<br/>
there would be a much better combine bastardsword to buy for just 10pp more...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help.<br/>
