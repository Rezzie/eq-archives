<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706811508">Fellow minstrels I must comment on the subject of a certain bard guild.  And for the record of their number, but i must say that you will not find a guild in Norrath with better spending of thier funds.  If you wish to join a guild that does not charge such high dues try the Bleeding Hearts, but also do not expect the kind of support that you will get from the Soerbairds.<br/>
