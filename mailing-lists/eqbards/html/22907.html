<div id="ygrps-yiv-88969931">Well in theory there is no actual horse graphic, other than a small item in<br/>
your inventory.  No one sees you ride the horse, its more like a 2 charge<br/>
potion of a specific gate spell...  I figured they would not have the<br/>
graphical resources to add a horse graphic...</div>
