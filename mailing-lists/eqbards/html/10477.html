<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471292103">Do any of our great bards out there have some good ideas for dungeon<br/>
crawling for a 20th going on 21st level bard?  I&#39;ve been hunting a lot<br/>
outdoors, and can make money pretty fast now if I need to, so I&#39;m more<br/>
interested in going somewhere that might have interesting loot items.  I<br/>
have considered Solusek&#39;s Eye but not sure if I am high enough to do well<br/>
there.  Any other suggestions?  I can solo high blues even I have found<br/>
since I reached 20th, but prefer to group.  Would there be groups in Sol A<br/>
that would be the right levels for me?<br/>
