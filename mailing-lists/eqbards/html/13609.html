<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001859952">Maybe we should submit a petition and ask Verant to nerf Pixie Strike and<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Pixie Strike WAS changed.  It used to not have the MR reduction effect.  <br/>
&gt; When it was a straight mez/stun song it was much more effective.  The MR <br/>
&gt; debuff introduced the dreaded double save.<br/>
