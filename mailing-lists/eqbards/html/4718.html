<div id="ygrps-yiv-80062574"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Has everyone else noticed that missed notes when starting a<br/>
&gt;song is now annoying frequent?  Not just with new songs<br/>
&gt;either, I&#39;m missing notes with low level songs like<br/>
&gt;Accelerando and Hymn.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve noticed this too.. simple songs like Selo&#39;s and my level 16 bard is <br/>
having to make 4 tries to get it started.<br/>
<br/>
Even worse is the fact that on Veeshan right now for some reason or <br/>
another, people level 1-4 aren&#39;t spawning with Food, Water or their default <br/>
weapon after they die. Someone tell me how in the world a level 1-4 player <br/>
is supposed to advance with no weapon? I mean, the lack of food and water <br/>
is just an annoying &quot;Out Of&quot; message, but no weapon? Several bug reports <br/>
and petitions later and no response.<br/>
