<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039633747">I&#39;m not in that shot. Pwyll and Monica were to bard friends of mine. I&#39;m<br/>
offscreen by the bb exit. I had Pwyll&#39;s icq but as far as I know he<br/>
quit and went back to UO. You could ask the one on your server if it&#39;s<br/>
him back again. If so say Phayde says hi.<br/>

&gt; which character are you?  there is a bard named Pwyll on my server?  common<br/>
&gt; name?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; They nerfed it well before release I&#39;m afraid. To get an idea of how<br/>
&gt; &gt; well it worked in beta, check out this screenshot I saved from my BB<br/>
&gt; &gt; days in P4.<br/>
