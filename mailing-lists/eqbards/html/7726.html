picked your feet up off the ground, where you go from there<br/>
is your decision. (like running up a hill and flying off, or<br/>
running up a slope and hopping onto a house.)  So in that<br/>
sense you control your own altitude.<br/>
<br/>
With the bard song you can actually continue to rise. (as if<br/>
someone casted levitate on your already levitating body) <br/>
There is a ceiling to which the song no longer levitates you<br/>
any higher.  I believe it&#39;s between 10 - 15 pulses when you <br/>
will no longer rise up, but until then your Z coordinate <br/>
continues to increase.<br/>
