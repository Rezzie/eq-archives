I have been told that this is a common method by high level characters to<br/>
powerlevel lower level characters.  Like you said, if the mob gives the<br/>
higher level character experience, the lower level character will gone none.<br/>
If the mob does not give the higher level character experiece, the lower<br/>
level one character will get it all.<br/>

Alas, my group tested this last night and found it not to be true.  We went to<br/>
Unrest to help a comrade kill yard trash.  At 16 and 17th level, most of the<br/>
death beetles give no exp to us.  Our friend checked exp, we killed 10 beetles,<br/>
for which none of us got the exp message, and he also got nothing.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, dropping him out of the group, beating a red to within an<br/>
inch of it&#39;s life, having our enchanter mem blur it, and having him do the final<br/>
little bit resulted in him getting 100 percent of the exp.<br/>
