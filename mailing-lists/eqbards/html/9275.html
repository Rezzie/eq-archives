&gt; So if lament is really that great, why are you higher level folks always<br/>
&gt; arguing about whether crowd control is best done with Lullaby, Chain, or<br/>
&gt; Charm?  Is it just that they hit multiple mobs at once?  Or are they<br/>
&gt; better<br/>
&gt; than Lament even for single mobs?<br/>

one mob at a time.  Lullaby, Pixie Strike, and  Charm are used if multiple<br/>
mobs are already involved in the fight, and you need to temporarily stop<br/>
them while your group concentrates on one mob at a time.<br/>
