<div id="ygrps-yiv-693505185"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Despite all the cries of nerf from necros, necros are still so<br/>
&gt; overpowered compared to the other classes that a single necro<br/>
&gt; can do things that require several L50s of other classes.  It<br/>
&gt; hasn&#39;t been fixed yet, so my guess is that a couple important<br/>
&gt; people at Verant play necros and want to keep things that way.<br/>
&gt; Seriously, I think class balance is a low priority with them.<br/>
