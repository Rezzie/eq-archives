<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442828729">People - PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE respond via private email to this survey.  I<br/>
am sure the majority of us - while perhaps interested in the results of the<br/>
survey - aren&#39;t interested in the raw data.  I am guessing there are<br/>
something like 250+ people on this list (no clue - just a guess) - making<br/>
250 people see your stats is a big waste of bandwidth..<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
