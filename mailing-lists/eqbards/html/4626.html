&gt; upgrade, and before i went up with a sizable group.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought the way it worked was that the higher the con the less experience<br/>
you lose? Meaning, you lose a whole lot more experience from something that<br/>
con&#39;s green than from something that con&#39;s red. Is this not correct?</div>
