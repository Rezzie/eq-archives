<div id="ygrps-yiv-635939725">before i put away my demon claw, i was hitting for 23 with it max.  my str<br/>
is over 120, can get in 180-200STR range with shaman and druid buffs.  hit<br/>
for 36 a lot when i used the staff of writhing.  hit for mid 20s with<br/>
silvery war axe.  with my crystalline blade, one night, fully buffed, one<br/>
time, i hit for 50 woohoo.  i hit for 43 and 44 a lot though.  i am working<br/>
on getting ykeshas still, dmg 8 so should hit for over 32 plus the proc is<br/>
nice and delay is low.  i think with 200 skill in that weapon and as much<br/>
strength as possible, you can hit for 4 times dmg or slightly more.<br/>

&gt; I am interested in seeing what kind of dmg Shada can get with various <br/>
&gt; weapons at 50th or any of our other high level bards.<br/>
&gt; With my claw I have hit up to 19pts, with shard or dirk (both <br/>
&gt; 6 dmg weapons) <br/>
&gt; i have hit for up to 23 pts, with staff of writhing up to 33, <br/>
&gt; and with <br/>
&gt; crystalline blade i think 37. I have had my STR as high as <br/>
&gt; 150 from various <br/>
&gt; buffs and battle songs.<br/>
