<div id="ygrps-yiv-232469498">aye a bard in my guild was charming Azaracks in Sky last night.  i was<br/>
thinking of taking Quag on a killing spree, i never thought of Dino.  only<br/>
problem with these things is running out of mana and not being able to<br/>
finish off your pet.  i lose about 1/2 bubb of mana for every 2 seafuries i<br/>
kill.  so hopefully they will just up the mana a little rather than reduce<br/>
the song&#39;s effectiveness.<br/>
<br/>
also you can not recharm before it wears off as someone told John.<br/>
