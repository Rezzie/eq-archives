<div id="ygrps-yiv-874768866">You do get more bang for your buck with this combination, but for me, it&#39;d<br/>
just be way too much work. Besides, at a younger level you&#39;re still plenty<br/>
good with a sword to be considered a melee class. Do you find you takedown<br/>
mobs faster with your Kung Fu Instrument/Weapon attack than if you just<br/>
twisted Warsong/Hymn/Chords?<br/>

By far my most effective combonation against any just about any mob I&#39;ve<br/>
come accross is CoD/Bellow/Hymn with a lute.   There are only two reason to<br/>
switch to weapon+sheild:  If I&#39;m too close to another mob to sing CoD or if<br/>
I&#39;m needed to increase a particular weapon skill.  Otherwise I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
putting the lute away until it&#39;s time to run somewhere.<br/>
