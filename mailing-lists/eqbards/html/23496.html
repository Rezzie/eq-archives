&gt; &gt; Yes, there are quests that offer very similar rewards but <br/>
&gt; have you tried to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get them? PoG drops the items &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  What quests Jim ? Moonflower has spent 2 days there &quot;Hailing&quot;<br/>
&gt; everything. The ONLY creature that responds is the Prince and <br/>
&gt; he doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; respond no matter what I ask after he asks why I came... This <br/>
&gt; is really<br/>
&gt; poorly thought out....<br/>
