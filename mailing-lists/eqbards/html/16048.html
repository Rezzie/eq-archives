<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366280127"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Besides, it&#39;d be really really stupid if Verant coded it based<br/>
&gt;on primary weapon.  If that were so, you could put a mithril<br/>
&gt;quill (4/16) in your primary and a glowing pike (9/36) in your<br/>
&gt;secondary, and your secondary would act like a 9/16 weapon.<br/>

ameliorated by the check, meaning if the check said &quot;yes, dual wield&quot; that<br/>
because the offhand weapon wasn&#39;t cycled yet that it wouldn&#39;t swing. Just<br/>
goes to show how detailed wrong information can be *smile*. Thanks for<br/>
clearing that up.<br/>
