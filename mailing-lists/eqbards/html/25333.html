<div id="ygrps-yiv-549045668">So much for the bards without primal weapons. Procing Avatar will surely<br/>
make or break the bard here. I guess the only way to keep the fight even is<br/>
to have Syvelian&#39;s Anti-Magic Aria ready when you see it go off. I think the<br/>
message is &quot;&lt;name&gt; is (something) with/like an Avatar&quot; If you see that,<br/>
keel!!<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering about SoW potions though, how are those classified; right<br/>
click item?<br/>

The date wasn&#39;t posted, did I just miss it somewhere?<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
