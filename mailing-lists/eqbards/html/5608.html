snarer?  Fights get much longer as you get higher in level,<br/>
and as I&#39;ve mentioned, the problems I&#39;ve been having around<br/>
level 30 have been snares expiring and mobs running, at which<br/>
point I have to chase and chain them (which is *not* a good<br/>
thing when I&#39;ve been busy keeping two mobs mesmerized with<br/>
Pixie Strike).  I dunno, maybe the ranger has been casting<br/>
them too early.<br/>
