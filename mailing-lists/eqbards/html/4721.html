<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160206399">Ok, Bards are an adventurous sort (usually) so I thought I would pick the<br/>
minds of my comrades in song. (smile).<br/>
<br/>
The Fear Plane... great loot, great XP... HARD monsters.... or so that&#39;s all<br/>
I&#39;ve &quot;heard&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You enter the zone, instant death. You enter the zone, instand backstabs for<br/>
400-800 points. You enter the zone, you can&#39;t leave except by Evac and even<br/>
THAT only works 10% of the time. The list of horror stories goes on.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT is TRUTH? Can you fight at the zone and flee if it gets bad? How<br/>
&quot;different&quot; does magic work? Do our songs work??<br/>
<br/>
ANY info and tales appreciated!<br/>
