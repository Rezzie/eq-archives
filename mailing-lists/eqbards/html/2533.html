<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140832221">Over the weekend I started a Bard on the test server.  I have to say the <br/>
wide open spaces are nice, zoned into West Karana and I was the only one <br/>
there :)  The highest level Bard I have seen (via /w bard all) has been 18th <br/>
level. Anyone else out there playing a Bard on Test?  Would be nice to have <br/>
a partner, I am currently 5th level and in the Qeynos area.<br/>
