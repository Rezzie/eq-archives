&gt; &gt; I would suggest NOT meditating for these tests, unless there is the possibility that jig only<br/>
&gt; &gt; affects mana regen while meditating.  Meditation adds a large random element to mana<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The song is purported to have an effect on meditation rate.<br/>
&gt; Has a myth now been started that it increases your<br/>
&gt; non-meditating mana regeneration rate?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who can keep up with the myths surrounding this song? :)<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s the case, then meditate away during the tests.  Just be aware of the randomness.<br/>
<br/>
Better yet, tell people that it&#39;s all a myth and if they don&#39;t believe you, too bad. :)<br/>
