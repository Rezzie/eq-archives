&gt; The title of the tune though is &quot;Disenchanting&quot;.  This implies to me that it<br/>
&gt; removes magical enchantment from *items*.  Since it is unlikely to remove the<br/>
&gt; MAGIC status of a weapon altogether, perhaps it removes &quot;procs&quot; that a weapon<br/>
&gt; might have.  Has anyone gone into an Arena, run ADM and seen if procing<br/>
&gt; weapons didn&#39;t proc on you?  Maybe a Staff of Writhing and a PGT against you<br/>
