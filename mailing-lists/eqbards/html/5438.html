<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173249953"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The difference between my story and yours?  I was bound in Kelethin, and<br/>
&gt;heading for Erudin.  Death #1 = the exact same place you died, but Death #2<br/>
&gt;was in Kithicor (thanks, Capt. Shralok!).  That&#39;s when I decided to ask for<br/>
&gt;a teleport.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    That makes me ask something that was in my mind for some time now.<br/>
Why we bards, Traveleurs of Norrah, that should move from city to city,<br/>
telling our stories..<br/>
           Why we don&#39;t have any binding song?? I particulary think it would<br/>
make sense,<br/>
       Even if not bind forever, it could have binded a few days, instead i<br/>
have to buy, &quot;or beg to buy&quot; someone else bind !!!<br/>
