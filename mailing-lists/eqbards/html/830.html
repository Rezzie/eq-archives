&gt; I have heard that Upper Guk can be a good hunting ground from teens all the<br/>
&gt; way up to high twenties. Is it possible for non-evil type races to go to<br/>
&gt; Guk or are they KOS? How does one go about getting to Guk from S. Ro?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The inhabitants of upper guk are the frogloks, who are actually &quot;good guys&quot;.<br/>
They hate the evil races, and tolerate the good ones (until the good guys start<br/>
killing them).  The only faction changes you get from killing them are with the<br/>
Frogloks themselves though, so most people just decide to make an enemy of the<br/>
frogs for the sake of the loot.  As far as getting there, it&#39;s not too hard.<br/>
There are some wandering troll NPCs, but not many.  It&#39;s much more dangerous<br/>
for a troll outside guk than it is for an elf.<br/>
