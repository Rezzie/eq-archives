 I replied that this will really hurt bards. We will lose the services<br/>
of our pets for a short amount of time, will have to charm more (more<br/>
mana) and will take more damage because of pets having to be targeted<br/>
each attack.<br/>
<br/>
 I suggested that they consider lengthening the amount of time a<br/>
successful Charm lasts as a way of compensation.. even 5 seconds would<br/>
be helpful...</div>
