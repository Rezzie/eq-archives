<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740882271">I had a GM explain what was the current theory on that: due to heavy server<br/>
load it is possible for more than 1 person to fight the same mob, i.e., the<br/>
mob gets twinned.  When the server recognizes the conflict its means of<br/>
resolution is to rejoin the two entities in a &quot;safe&quot; location.  Makes sense<br/>
on the surface even if he was shooting me a line. :)<br/>
<br/>
And as for the z-axis &quot;feature&quot;... I was the king of all chicken pullers<br/>
since all I had to do was stand my troll shaman at the base of the tree and<br/>
they would come running immediately after a new flock had come home to<br/>
roost!  What fun that was to RP every spawn cycle differently. :)</div>
