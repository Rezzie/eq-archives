<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847427217">Ok, not entirely a bard topic, but as collectors of information I figured<br/>
someone here would know.  Where does this portal go to and what is the key?<br/>
Also, I sure don&#39;t recall seeing this portal here when I was fighting there<br/>
a couple of weeks ago; and how the heck could I have missed that giant<br/>
spinning ball???  When did this get added?<br/>
