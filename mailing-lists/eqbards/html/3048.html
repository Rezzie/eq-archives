<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-954645019">I just reached level 12, and now the things I used to hunt in Steamfront all con green. Where should I go from here? I could stay here and kill mino&#39;s, but they&#39;re too hard to find (camped most of the time). Where should I go from here? What&#39;s good for level 12? Any help is greatly appreciated.<br/>
