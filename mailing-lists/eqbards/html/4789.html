In truth many people do I would think.  Only recently I gave up the<br/>
dragoon dirk/combine rapier combo for a dirk/polished granite tomahawk.<br/>
As vain as I may sound I prefer the dirk/rapier look.  I just need the<br/>
tomahawk since I usually end up being the tank in my party.  Having seen<br/>
a staff of writhing I absolutely refuse to wield one.  What would the<br/>
ladies think of you while using one? &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
