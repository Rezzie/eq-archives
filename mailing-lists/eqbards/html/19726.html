<div id="ygrps-yiv-528749015">*laugh* I&#39;m an enchanter. What&#39;s AC?<br/>

Yes, the lowered agility-moves slower is why I finally started <br/>
destroying copper<br/>
(My base agility is lower than 75. So its easy for me to hit)<br/>

&gt;careful with that.  being overweight reduces agility.  if you <br/>
&gt;start hitting the<br/>
&gt;&#39;&#39;reverse&#39;&#39; plateaus down thru the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s you will start <br/>
&gt;losing chunks of ac. </span></blockquote></div>
