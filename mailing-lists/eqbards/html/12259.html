<div id="ygrps-yiv-533744747">When my friend uses Lullaby on his secondary character, it&#39;s always sung<br/>
(since I&#39;d posted about seeing it used effectively awhile back). We are<br/>
still seeing renewed use out of this song in Unrest in the mid-20s,<br/>
although now we often get an enchanter in the group, and AE mes makes<br/>
any other ae attacks undesirable.<br/>
<br/>
I can still vouch for lullaby&#39;s value to higher level bards myself,<br/>
however. I took out a judicator in Cazic-Thule the other day solo and it<br/>
never got a single heal off, 5 clean interrupts and then it died. I<br/>
think the only cleric more difficult in Cazic is the Cenobite, and I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t lay odds on him stacking up 1 on 1 well against a 50 Bard<br/>
either. I mean heck if the fight were even looking close there is always<br/>
Chains and Fear. =P<br/>
