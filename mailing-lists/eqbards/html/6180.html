<div id="ygrps-yiv-803065076">So I have been seeing the posts about how Selo&#39;s beats out SoW any day of<br/>
the week.  I had never had the chance to test this until I was helping a<br/>
druid friend get their body from LavaStorm.  I asked if they wanted to group<br/>
and use my song or if they just wanted to use SoW as we ran through the<br/>
forest.  Well she tried to keep up with me using SoW and couldn&#39;t so I<br/>
grouped her and used Selo.  I am only 14th Level with a standard drum.  Just<br/>
thought I would share :)<br/>
