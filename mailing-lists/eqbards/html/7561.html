<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621728864"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a central distinction in the kiting issue.  Snare (and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; root) has to be cast on the mob, and thus can be resisted.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; SoW and Accelerando are cast on the kiter, and thus cannot be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; resisted.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Then change the argument to someone having SOW cast on them<br/>
&gt; &gt; and then running around using a bow.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So you advocate taking away Accelerando from bards to give<br/>
&gt; them Archery?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I missed where you said &quot;Sow and Accelerando&quot; and<br/>
only saw Accelerando. *shrug* But still, if another class<br/>
can use SOW and a bow.. Why wouldn&#39;t a bard be able to use<br/>
Accelerando and a bow?</div>
