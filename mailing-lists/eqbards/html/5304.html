first bronze sword off a bandit, have to go sell now. <br/>
Don&#39;t skimp on the armor though, increase your<br/>
strenght.  Get a blackened iron crown, spiked collar,<br/>
str rings, str earrings, bloodstained mantle and an<br/>
erollisi bracer.  Then you&#39;ll be able to lug some<br/>
loot.  Light armor on a bard IMO = long naked walk<br/>
back to body.</div>
