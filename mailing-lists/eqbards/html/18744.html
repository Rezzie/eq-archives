<div id="ygrps-yiv-437690177">Hmmm, one more question. My dex is hovering somewhere about 107 down from<br/>
about 117 due to focusing on AC. Now that I will be weilding dual daggers I<br/>
am thinking about speed again. Does anyone know if  there is a  &quot;magic<br/>
number&quot; close by at which point I would have a big speed increase, or am I<br/>
just looking at diminishing returns the higher I go?<br/>
