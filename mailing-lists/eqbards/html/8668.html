<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-34872181">Anyone know what the purpose of today&#39;s patch is yet?<br/>
<br/>
Also, I noticed a strange hovering door in Highkeep last night in the main<br/>
entryway courtyard when you first come in that must be some kind of bug and<br/>
the High Elf who starts the Thex Dagger quest was gone and my &quot;Princess<br/>
Lenya&#39;s Amulet&quot; had its name and graphic changed to &quot;Thex charm&quot; or<br/>
something like that.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a question, I finally have some plat saved up to where I can<br/>
begin to buy some steel armor to replace my ugly bronze until I can start<br/>
moving forward to Lambent so does anyone know if I can find size &quot;medium&quot;<br/>
steel plate armor for sale in either Freeport or Qeynos?  I know it is sold<br/>
in Kelethin but I am not sure if you can find it at these other cities.<br/>
