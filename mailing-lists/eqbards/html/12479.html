<div id="ygrps-yiv-380861745">The Mistmoore Battle Dirge<br/>
<br/>
Battle you brave soldiers; fight with all your might.<br/>
For the curse of those around us are concealed in the light.<br/>
<br/>
But when darkness falls upon us, and Mayong´┐¢s curse revealed,<br/>
The pain of those enslaved in here will not remain concealed.<br/>
<br/>
So free the undead spirits, the vamp and lycanthrope<br/>
Free them from this cursed life; you are their only hope.<br/>
<br/>
