 </span></blockquote>Yeah, this is indeed waaay off topic, but I&#39;ll reply to the list since<br/>
understanding our medium of exchange generally doesn&#39;t hurt.  If this<br/>
provokes any further discussion we shouldn&#39;t abuse a busy, well-focussed,<br/>
well-behaved list.<br/>

Email is a lot like real letters.  Order of delivery is not constrained and<br/>
mail handling software makes no attempt to maintain any order.  For<br/>
example, a delivery system may run multiple processes and one may stick on<br/>
a communication failure or a large message and let another with more recent<br/>
messages get ahead.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t see it, but down in the bowels of the Internet the &quot;IP&quot; part of<br/>
&quot;TCP/IP&quot; works the same way.<br/>
