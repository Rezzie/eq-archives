fighting an orc centurion.  The orc would only ding him for<br/>
1-2 points every few hits.  He was healing at a normal 1 point<br/>
every 6 seconds so he was effectively taking no damage.  He<br/>
could barely hit the orc because it was red to him.  So the<br/>
result was a stalemate as these two hacked at each other for<br/>
almost 10 minutes.  He could&#39;ve breezed through L1-5 without<br/>
any downtime if he&#39;d stuck with even-con mobs.<br/>
