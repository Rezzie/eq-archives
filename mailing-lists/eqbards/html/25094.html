<br/>
This is the first &quot;Release&quot; version.  Many things have been changed <br/>
(because as you know, a x.00 version always has tons of bugs ;)  <br/>
Thanks all for the help!<br/>
<br/>
Again, as always, if you see any errors or have any suggestions, <br/>
please e-mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqreed@...">eqreed@...</a> <br/>
