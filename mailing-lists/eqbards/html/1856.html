<div id="ygrps-yiv-486202948">Friend and I once tossed the idea around of producing a stage play.  Once we<br/>
got down to it, and tried to coordinate some simple blocking and dialog, we<br/>
realized it was just too much of a pain.  The exciting scene, tension mounts<br/>
as Bill hunts and pecks.  Boring play, everybody just standing around<br/>
typing.  So we never did it.<br/>
<br/>
Course, I agree,  suppose it would be abused, isn&#39;t everything eh?<br/>

&gt;I agree completely.  If we had any kind of scripting command, it would<br/>
&gt;be SO abused, it wouldn&#39;t be funny.  This is something that would have<br/>
&gt;to be VERY limited.  I come from a BBS / Mud background as well, one<br/>
&gt;thing I have seen people do to limit this is enforce a delay between </span></blockquote></div>
