<div id="ygrps-yiv-330731536">Some good suggestions have been made for you at 32nd, but I&#39;d like to throw<br/>
in Cazic-Thule as well.  The experience in that zone is quite good, and I<br/>
have several friends that are still there at 35 and talking about how they<br/>
don&#39;t intend to leave anytime soon.  Just get into groups that are hunting<br/>
in the Maze, Throne Room or even the Avatar of Fear.  I&#39;m there now on<br/>
Fennin Ro and having a pretty good time.  For me at 28, hunting alligators<br/>
is very rewarding experience-wise.<br/>
