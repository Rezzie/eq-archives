<b>Subject:</b> Veeshan Worship Affect Faction? <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-106662093">Does worshiping Veeshan have any weird affect on faction? Strangely enough,<br/>
only bards can worship... is a Veeshan worshipper not KOS to Vox, Nagafen?<br/>
It seems like a strange addition to the game, IMHO.<br/>
