<div id="ygrps-yiv-381242161">Looking for some good ideas for soloing and small team hunting around 18th<br/>
level.  Currently I am hunting Beholder Maze frequently , sometimes high<br/>
hold pass or Oasis of Marr.  Any good suggestions?  Are any of the multitude<br/>
of islands out in the Ocean of Tears any good?<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately I seem to have solo hunting and hunting with a cleric partner<br/>
down to an art, but whenever I get into a group I always seem to die.  As<br/>
you all know, we frequently become the baiters because of our speed, and<br/>
because of that if you pick up more than the chosen monster to fight<br/>
accidentally, death is not a far step away.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I am outfitted in full banded, but have not even seen a place with the<br/>
bronze armor some have spoken of, or some of the many magic items that<br/>
proliferate the deeper dungeons.</div>
