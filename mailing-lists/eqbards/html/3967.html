&gt;&gt;At some level your normal regeneration rate gets upgraded to 3<br/>
&gt;&gt;pts/tick (not quite sure when or if this is sitting), which<br/>
&gt;&gt;would put it at 19 pts/tick at L42. Sitting gives you an extra<br/>
&gt;&gt;1 pt/tick, for 20 pts/tick.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Actually, sitting doubles your natural regen rate, as a troll regens 2 hp<br/>
&gt;standing, 4 sitting.  I was curious whether or not HP regeneration ever<br/>
&gt;increased, this is good to know.<br/>

buffs?  After playing both a bard and a shaman, I&#39;m thinking that<br/>
I&#39;ll look up an appropriate level shaman with my bard.  Might be an<br/>
interesting combo.<br/>
