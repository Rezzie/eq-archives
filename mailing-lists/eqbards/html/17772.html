<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180710827">I have yet to experience that particular zoning bug, but I have often<br/>
fallen victim to the zoning bug in Ogguk--often when someone zones at one<br/>
bubb or less of life, they get teleported to a random location near the<br/>
center of the zone, but not always the same location.  Myself, I do not<br/>
want to *count* the times that has happened to me, but it has always been<br/>
at a bubble or less.  Anyone know how common this is, or am I just a<br/>
lucky one?<br/>
