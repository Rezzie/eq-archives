<div id="ygrps-yiv-670043062">At the time I got zapped, I was right near the zone border.  I was singing<br/>
DDD so I probably aggroed something inside the castle.  Based on what John<br/>
Kim said about LOS, that probably accounts for me gettting killed in one<br/>
shot even though I got no message indicating that I got hit. <br/>

&gt; you attack it, its master on the other side of that wall which is deep<br/>
&gt; within the castle, will kill you in a jiffy.  Pick your fights wisely and<br/>

&gt; NOT, I repeat DO NOT use AE songs in this zone unless you are very certain<br/>
