<b>Subject:</b> Song question - AntiMagic Aria <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941866590">Has anyone figured out what this song actually does? It seems to annoy<br/>
mobs in the area but doesn&#39;t seem to inhibit casting in anyway I have<br/>
noticed.<br/>
<br/>
Also, is the fact that Celerity and Anthem won&#39;t weave with each other a<br/>
bug or intentional. I have yet to find a party that prefered the agility<br/>
boost over the strength boost. Celerity will weave with chant of battle<br/>
but it still seems to add up to less of a combat boost for the tanks<br/>
than just playing Anthem.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if they are running short on ideas for songs, how about making the<br/>
L39 song a dex booster that will weave with anthem. <br/>
