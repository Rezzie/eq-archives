<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539893083">The aforementioned test server patch is apparently going live as we speak.<br/>
Also included are the new animated emotes that were already on the test<br/>
server from last week.  Lets see if we can&#39;t get some info tonite!  Wonder<br/>
if the updated Mino horn will still be a bag on my wrist?<br/>
