<b>Subject:</b> Warning on charming and shamen pets <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785751612">I have had this happend to me twice this week now.  I charm something that <br/>
had been attacking a Shamen&#39;s pet (one was a party members pet, other a <br/>
non-party member). And both times the shamen pet decided I looked tasty and <br/>
started nipping at me, bad dog! :)  So becareful using charm are shamen&#39;s <br/>
pets, unless you like being their chew toy.<br/>
