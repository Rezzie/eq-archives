<div id="ygrps-yiv-826672834">Talies, you do, indeed, have to log off to report again.  Verant has said that, and, I learned that one as well.  Sadly, only 15th, and already reported a few people. *sighs*<br/>

  I have a question - was hoping that someone would test this for me... I <br/>
  need to know if zoning allows you to report again, or if you must log off <br/>
  first.<br/>
