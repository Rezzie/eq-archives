<div id="ygrps-yiv-793006408">Last night in lower guk a fellow was auctioning a &quot;shark-skin drum&quot; that he<br/>
said he picked up in Kedge Keep and he claimed that a bard friend who tested<br/>
it for him said that it was about 15% faster speed increase over the MM<br/>
drum.  I tried to trade an Enameled Black Chestplate for it but he wanted<br/>
like 10kpp worth of stuff for it.<br/>
<br/>
He also told me his Ykesha was only for trade for 10kpp worth of loot but<br/>
that he was planning on probably holding on to it until after Verant &quot;makes<br/>
the patch that changes the Ykesha to a warrior only weapon&quot; and the price<br/>
&quot;goes through the roof&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any knowledge/comments on these rumors?<br/>
