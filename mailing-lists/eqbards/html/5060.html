<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850585864">The easiest and most sensible fix is to remove the z-axis code, and fix<br/>
spell casters so they can&#39;t cast any spells while levitating.  So they can<br/>
either float away from danger, or get down on the ground and attack, but<br/>
they can&#39;t have it both ways.<br/>

My guess would be that in the orignal design you could levitate and attack<br/>
from on-high with little or no risk when attacking a melee only mob. When<br/>
they went in to &quot;fix&quot; this and created our little z-axis bug, they really<br/>
had no way to effectively block mob&#39;s at different elevations or through<br/>
floors and walls from getting hit with songs/spell effects.<br/>
<br/>
Basicially what Verant would have to do is implement some sort of colission<br/>
detection code that would stop the songs effects from passing through the<br/>
enironment where their are barriers (walls, floors). Of course if they got<br/>
really fancy they could try to model sound waves and how they would bounce<br/>
off the surfaces. Imagine singing Denon&#39;s down a long echoing corridor!<br/>
