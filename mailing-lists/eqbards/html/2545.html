<div id="ygrps-yiv-418644041">Sorry, not bard specific, but since 99% of bards use 1h slashing, thought<br/>
you might be interested.<br/>
This weapon was just posted up on Gameznet.  Does anyone know where to find<br/>
it?  How hard it is to get?  I&#39;m sure its not something that I&#39;ll be able to<br/>
obtain myself, but it would be nice to know.<br/>
