<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690042991">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
  I am new to this list and have read two digests so far. I just reached <br/>
8th level a few days ago and was curious about a few things. <br/>
My bardess resides in Kelethin and the guild there only sells songs up to the<br/>
7th level song. I am curious as to where I would obtain the rest of the songs.<br/>
Not sure where to start looking for them or if they are quests. The guild leader<br/>
in Kelethin only gives out drums for four spiderling silks.<br/>
<br/>
I would like for the information either on the list or emailed to me directly<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
<br/>
