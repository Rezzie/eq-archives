<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486599361">As several people have noted, one cause of overcrowding is a higher level<br/>
character soloing in a spot designed for a group of lower level characters.<br/>
One level 50 camping Item X takes a potential spawn area from a group of<br/>
level 20&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Potential solution:  Magical items don&#39;t drop if the character doesn&#39;t get<br/>
any experience.<br/>
<br/>
+ reduces farming<br/>
+ reduces twinking<br/>
+ frees up spawns for appropriate level groups<br/>
- forces you to get an item before you gain a certain level<br/>
- forces you to trade for an item you can&#39;t get yourself<br/>
<br/>

Any comments?</div>
