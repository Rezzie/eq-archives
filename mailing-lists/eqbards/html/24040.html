<div id="ygrps-yiv-31323102">A good group can be a frightening thing in Dalinars.  A bad group should<br/>
stick to Frontier Mts.<br/>
<br/>
My cleric&#39;s group spent 4 weeks in Dalinars.  1 5 hour session a week.  2<br/>
Non hell and 1 Hell level each.  Thats a (non hell) level per 5 hour<br/>
session.  Add in 6 fighting batons, 2 saps, and a few other lesser items,<br/>
and as much Fine Steel as we could carry (each week).<br/>
<br/>
Dalinar&#39;s (like most dungeons) is made for groups of people you know and<br/>
trust.<br/>
