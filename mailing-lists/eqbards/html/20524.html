<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1365818411">Like Pixie Strike, the resists for Song of Twilight make it dodgy to use for<br/>
crowd control.  What it is great at, however, is traffic control.<br/>
<br/>
In many areas, controlling the placement of the mob is important.  They get<br/>
pushed towards walls or bridges or just move away too fast when we are<br/>
chaining.  So I stand in the chosen spot and use Song of Twilight to pull the<br/>
mob to me.  The rogue I often group with loves it; I can pull that mob away<br/>
from the wall or corner so he can backstab.<br/>
