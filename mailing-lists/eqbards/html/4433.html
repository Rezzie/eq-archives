Are you refering to bards not getting 3 skill points max per level? If you<br/>
are, I would like you to spend your next 3 points on hand to hand and try to<br/>
go up one more time.  The message you will receive is something along the<br/>
lines that you are maxed for your level. I cannot remember the exact wording<br/>
but that is the content.  I have even fought Hand to Hand for a full 3 bars<br/>
worth of xp thinking training will not go up further, but actual hands on<br/>
(no pun intended) training would increase it.  My friends, Bards are 3 per<br/>
level plus whatever it is we get as a base.<br/>

&gt;&gt;Might have something to do<br/>
&gt;&gt;with only getting 3/level. I hear a lot of people say bards get 4 per or 5<br/>
&gt;&gt;per. Trust me... We get 3. </span></blockquote></div>
