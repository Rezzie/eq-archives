&gt;you must be a combination of 2<br/>
&gt;classes (thus the term hybrid).  only SHD, PAL, RNG can be &gt;classified in <br/>
&gt;this way.  you can not name 2 classes that make up &gt;cleric, shaman, druid.<br/>

Warrior/Priest, a Ranger is a Warrior/Durid and a BARD is a <br/>
Fighter/Rouge/Druid/Mage<br/>

be useable only once per day.<br/>
