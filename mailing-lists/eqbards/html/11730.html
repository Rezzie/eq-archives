<div id="ygrps-yiv-542668963">Well since Dark Elf are not KOS in the Troll and Ogre city it would make<br/>
a great disguise.  Its much easier to pass yourself off as a dark elf<br/>
than a Troll in a a Troll city.  (Since when your a troll you have to<br/>
remember to scratch your butt all day, and put lots of Z&#39;s in your<br/>
sentences)<br/>

&gt; 4.      Ever think of why a froglok assasin would have an item that would change<br/>
&gt; them into a DE? The frogs are natural enemies to the Trolls and Ogres<br/>
&gt; (possibly the DE&#39;s too not sure). Mayhaps there was some subterranean plot<br/>
&gt; afoot to strike against the Tier&#39;Dal horde or evil races in general before<br/>
&gt; the frogs died? (This sorta falls apart if you consider the undead frogs as<br/>
&gt; plotting against the evil races since they attack everyone...)<br/>
