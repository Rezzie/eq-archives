It was mentioned before, perhaps by Jyzan or someone else that in Beta<br/>
you could construct instruments from the pieces scattered througout the<br/>
lands. Yet now it seems that almost every vendor has a piece of bamboo,<br/>
some lute strings, or something that we could use if we had the talents.<br/>
Is there any use for any of these pieces? Can instruments be made that<br/>
are perhaps better than store bought?<br/>
<br/>
Any and all information regarding this interesting pieces would be<br/>
apreicated.<br/>
