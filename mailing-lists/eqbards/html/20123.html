<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-523466004">It seems to me to be pretty rare when charm breaks early, if it does I hit<br/>
esc to clear my target and inevitably the one I charm is beating on me, so<br/>
he will soon be targeted again.<br/>
<br/>
I could retarget my pet right away, but then I am not dealing any melee<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
Chains was working worse last night than it normally does.  Which is saying<br/>
a lot since I think its a next to worthless song as is...</div>
