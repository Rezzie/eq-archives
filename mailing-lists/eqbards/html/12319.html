<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904252840">I noticed a similar thing this weekend as well.  I&#39;m <br/>
30th level now.  However, I died twice in level 29<br/>
while approaching 30.  Neither time did I lose more<br/>
than a quarter bubble of health.  In level 30 I&#39;ve<br/>
died twice and I think I&#39;ve lossed maybe an eighth of<br/>
a bubble each time.  Has anyone died lately that isn&#39;t<br/>
in a hell level?  <br/>
