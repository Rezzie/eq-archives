&gt; These are the most fun raids.  Small groups like this tend to be more<br/>
&gt; efficient than organized.  The challenge and the desire to <br/>
&gt; avoid even a<br/>
&gt; single mistake make these the most fun moments in the game.  <br/>
&gt; So far the<br/>
&gt; smallest group we&#39;ve taken is 10, with no casualties.  I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; thinking its<br/>
&gt; doable with 6.<br/>
