<div id="ygrps-yiv-567980879">Hello again fellow Bards,<br/>
<br/>
I have a pair of Elf Hide Gloves 5 AGI 5 DEX Bard/Rogue only.<br/>
They are Magic Item. Then how come if I hit let say a Willow Wisp<br/>
it says they are invulnerable to me? Is this normal? Maybe a Bug?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
