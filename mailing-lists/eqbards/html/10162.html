<div id="ygrps-yiv-351999692">Berserker Crescendo is a great song, mainly because it adds +20% attack speed. Suprised you didnt notice<br/>
this on your own.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Btw , anyone else think berserker crescendo is completely stupid and useless? It doesn&#39;t stack with<br/>
&gt; anything , and only gives +20 strength , or does it have other effects?<br/>
&gt; Thanks in Advance-<br/>
