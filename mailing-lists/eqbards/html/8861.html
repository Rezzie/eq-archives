 </span></blockquote>=(   yeah, even I still fail and pull a whole bunch<br/>
of goobers when I lament.  It&#39;s rare that it happens,<br/>
but everything agros when it does.  But I&#39;d say as long<br/>
as you are within 5 levels or so of the monster, and have<br/>
maybe good charisma?  you could pull it off.  Not too sure,<br/>
never really test lament out a whole lot, until I got older.<br/>
