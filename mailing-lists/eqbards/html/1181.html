&gt; I&#39;m a wood elf.  Those were the prices at the armor seller in the wood elf<br/>
&gt; city.  (AFTER I bought it, I realized that it was size Medium rather than<br/>
&gt; size Small, so I lost about 250 plat selling it back again. OUCH!  I<br/>
&gt; finally found the size Small one in the Dwarf city.)<br/>

people might not know this...<br/>
<br/>
Wood elves CAN wear size medium.  Or small.<br/>
<br/>
Now medium plate is a little heavier, so maybe that&#39;s why Beth sold it back,<br/>
but if the weight difference is worth 250 plat to you... wow, you&#39;re rich. :)<br/>
