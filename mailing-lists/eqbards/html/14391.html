<div id="ygrps-yiv-195280842">The gnoll teeth quest is very good (over the course of the evening I<br/>
turned in 4) Another one with good experience is the rabid wolf pelt quest.<br/>
Both times I could see definite movement on the experience bar. I turned<br/>
in quite a few of the rabid wolf pelts as well. So I did use experience so<br/>
that it was &quot;only&quot; 5 and a half hours for me.<br/>

&gt;&gt; I got nearly a full level from turning in 6 gnoll teeth to the guy in S<br/>
&gt;&gt; Qeynos.  So that certainly helped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  wow...  did they up the exp on those small quests a lot or what?<br/>
&gt;  I never got any exp from those when I was small, I got an item<br/>
&gt;  like a rusty sword, or a spell, and sometimes a moonstone.  Now<br/>
&gt;  I hear you just get a moonstone.<br/>
