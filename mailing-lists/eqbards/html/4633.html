There is an item on the EQ&#39;Lizer equipment list called a &quot;Fine Silk Turban -<br/>
This turban is found on Hatar a level 20ish sand giant who occasionally<br/>
spawns in the desert area&#39;s of Oasis and Ro&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This item gives AC10, fire resist +10, and weighs 0.3 - seems to me an ideal<br/>
head item for bards because it does not show up as a graphic on your<br/>
character, just makes you appear like you are not wearing anything on your<br/>
head.  I would love to wear this as I think it would fit with my character&#39;s<br/>
image, but I have never actually heard of or seen one in the game...anyone<br/>
have any more information on this?<br/>
