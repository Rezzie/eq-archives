<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326713006">Aye Musiker is on occasionally. Convinced him to do some soloing in <br/>
Dreadlands. Last I saw, he was 40.<br/>
<br/>
I tried some hunting in the Emerald Jungle. Easy to fear/chain the iksars. <br/>
Was funny, I tried to charm them and after the 4th failure remembered that <br/>
they can&#39;t be charmed. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t say the loot has been to great, but not many people in the zone so <br/>
the lag isn&#39;t too bad.<br/>

Happily sitting at his 40th song, in no rush to 50. :-)<br/>

&gt;I usually do a quick /who all bard to see who&#39;s on.  More for a boost in<br/>
&gt;self-esteem than anything else.  I actually like to see  high level Bards.<br/>
&gt;It gives me something to aim for.<br/>

&gt;I saw Lago when I was in EC last night.  There&#39;s just too few of us about.<br/>
