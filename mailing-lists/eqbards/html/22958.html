<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-615528660">i was a wizard in beta3.  got to level 18, then they changed the way AC<br/>
works and i died too much.  i finally broke down and started letting my wife<br/>
play.  a friend of ours told us how the level 7 and level 10 songs stacked<br/>
(when they did back then) and how sweet it was LOL.  even though they fixed<br/>
that long ago, that is how it got started.  i quit the wizard and started<br/>
playing my wife&#39;s bard, and that continued in final til she started her own<br/>
cleric.  i wanted to stay a bard because of being a casting class with plate<br/>
armor *grin* and also wood elves are just hot.<br/>
