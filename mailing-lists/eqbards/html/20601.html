Bought some songs this morning in FV and noticed Song of Dawn. It&#39;s not listed on the analysis sites - am I missing something? Or is this a new song?  Only had time to try it once on giant wasp in gfay. It is target, agro&#39;d wasp. made wasp &quot;winks&quot; and seemingly did nothing else.  Tried on myself and saw nothing with or without flute (its wind).  Is this the &quot;evade&quot; song that alters your position on the hate list?<br/>
