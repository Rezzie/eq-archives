<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993077368">Since I&#39;ve only very recently acquired my first proc&#39;ing ANYTHING, could<br/>
someone please tell me how they work?  I had assumed the weapons would proc<br/>
on their own just by fighting with them.  How do you get a pair of pants to<br/>
proc?  I&#39;d hate to think clothing that procs Gate would go off randomly from<br/>
wearing it.  Right-click the stuff or something?<br/>
