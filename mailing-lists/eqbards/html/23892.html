<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864199254">As I read it, the heal change won&#39;t affect us.  It seemed that high end<br/>
heals (better than greater heal) essentially had the taunt factor of greater<br/>
heal.  My secondary is a cleric, and I can definitly say that superior was<br/>
no where near the mega taunt I thought it would be.  Fortunatly for my<br/>
cleric, he is lvl 37 so the change wont affect him for a long time.<br/>
HOWEVER, for high clerics this could be devastating.  Can you imagine how<br/>
hard dragons are going to be now?  Main tank group, the cleric essentially<br/>
has to start healing after about 10 seconds.  He is going to agro that<br/>
dragon pretty damn quick, good bye mr cleric, good bye main tank group...<br/>
<br/>
Who requested DDD be improved?  Liek anyone is going to use it now that it<br/>
does a few more points of damage...</div>
