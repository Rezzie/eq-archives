&gt; &gt; Really?  The first time I tried to use Denon&#39;s (in a crowded High Hold), <br/>
&gt; &gt; I missed 103 in a row.  Really ticked off all the onlookers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   That doesn&#39;t count.  Your brass skill was probably like 10.<br/>
&gt;   I have 200 singing, I should never miss 4 or 5 notes in a row.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I missed notes on Clouding (invis) all the way from Erudin to Qeynos.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   In combat 4 missed notes with 200 skill is devastating to my <br/>
&gt;   twisting rhythm.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
