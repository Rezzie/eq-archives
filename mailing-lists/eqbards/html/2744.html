The best way to raise your pottery skill is to do the items in the pottery <br/>
book in the order they are presented.  My skill is in the 130&#39;s I have not <br/>
bothered to max it yet with large bowls (last item in pottery book).  The <br/>
best city I have found for pottery is Kelethin, I have heard that Halas has <br/>
all the need stuff as well.<br/>
