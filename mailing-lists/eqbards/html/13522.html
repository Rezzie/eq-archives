&gt; is this a quest component or the final product, do you know?  i heard that<br/>
&gt; all the items on PoS were obtainable only through quests, but the quest<br/>
&gt; components and npcs were found there.<br/>

  This was a drop off a Happy Harpy. What it looks like is either the quest<br/>
components are really really sweet or there are both drops and questable<br/>
items there. SOunds fun!<br/>
