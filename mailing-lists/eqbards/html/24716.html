<div id="ygrps-yiv-1913783029">For those who use it, my latest bard song calculator spreadsheet is <br/>
available.  (It&#39;s an Excell spreadsheet that calculates numbers given <br/>
level and instruments).  It should be up at Rokenn&#39;s site shortly <br/>
(www.eqsongs.com) but until then, you can get it here:<br/>

<br/>
The main changes are some more sets of numbers have been added, and <br/>
lots of song to song incompatibilities have been added.  See the <br/>
Documentation sheet for details.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any comments or modifications (or questions ;), please e-<br/>
mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:eqreed@...">eqreed@...</a>.  Enjoy!<br/>
