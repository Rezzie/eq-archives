<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810382400">17 too, I missed the Safe Fall question and I am pretty sure the Skyshrine<br/>
question.  The other I dunno, but the correct answer to that weapons quest<br/>
IS archery.  I mean we CAN use 2h blunt, not sure if they scored me wrong<br/>
there.  If not it was probably the Deity question I missed.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve only been to skyshrine once so i&#39;m sure I got that one wrong.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Reguarding the weapons skill, well we don&#39;t use bows and our <br/>
&gt; weapons cap at<br/>
&gt; 1 skill point in 2h weapons, kind of screwy question.<br/>
