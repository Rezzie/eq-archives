<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048592180">Heh with my cleric (who normally plays only in his regular group, but with<br/>
my play I have missed several sessions and need to catch up), I was gfrouped<br/>
with a monk and a bard in L Guk (&quot;How long could it take for us to tfind a<br/>
tank, lets get the ass sup camp while we wait&quot;).  The bard was singing the<br/>
oddest collection of songs.  Chains (good choice with no snarer or slower),<br/>
Curtailing Chant (with weapons) and Pslam of Cooling.  Eh????  I suggested<br/>
singing celerity night be more useful (though I am loathe to ever say<br/>
anything) since the monk was dual wielding knuckledusters.  Oddly she was<br/>
quite competent at crowd control.  With Pixie she was keeping 2 mobs at bay<br/>
with no trouble...</div>
