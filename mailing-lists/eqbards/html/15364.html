<div id="ygrps-yiv-856032665">Heh, I suppose the argument you could use is that the monster would naturally seek out and hoarde the<br/>
items which would most aid in slaying it.  Keep it out of the hands of do-gooders as it were.<br/>

Of course, why Naggy doesn&#39;t just snuff the thing out of existence with a quick breath I don&#39;t know.<br/>

&gt; Hee hee, reminds me of a habit often seen in old TSR AD&D modules.  You kill<br/>
&gt; the major baddie who happens to be a werewolf and find in his treasure<br/>
&gt; hoard... A scroll of Protection from Lycanthropes.  That always used to burn<br/>
&gt; my players way back when.<br/>
