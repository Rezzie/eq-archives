<div id="ygrps-yiv-240806341">Well thanks all for the information, think I&#39;ll just rough it and stick in <br/>
CB for money.  Also I found the belt quest in Kaladim semi satisfying since <br/>
I can drum run towards Kaladim and take those worthless belts to make 1 gp <br/>
from gems or bandages and such which isn&#39;t too bad.  Bards near Kelethin may <br/>
want to check into this to boast their funds also since we got it rough both <br/>
ways.<br/>
