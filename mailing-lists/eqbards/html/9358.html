I have and go through this EXACT same thing!<br/>
<br/>
To be honest? I have given up on trying to teach people until now<br/>
<br/>
The groups I am in at 26 are MUCH better at listening to new tactics<br/>
since as you get more levels, the &#39;run to mommy&#39; spots greatly reduce <br/>
(guards, zone points, etc) in number, and staying alive<br/>
is a big priority.<br/>
<br/>
So, don&#39;t give up hope, just wait a while =)<br/>
<br/>
People come around, but not until its worth it to them.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;ve almost given up on trying to perfect this (Lullaby) with<br/>
&gt; pickup groups<br/>
&gt; at my level (16-19). Either nobody understands /assist, they<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t trust my<br/>
&gt; lullaby to work, or they just plain don&#39;t listen. After one<br/>
&gt; nightmarish pull </span></blockquote></div>
