&gt;You can buy bronze from High Hold NPCs?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was shopping for bronze, I decided to go to places where higher level<br/>
charcters are, where they upgrade their armor.  I figured why go to the<br/>
source of the armor and pay a premium, like Unrest?  I went where they just<br/>
want to get rid of it, a place near a bank.  Many folks also seem too lazy<br/>
or impantient to sell their old armor to PCs and just dump them on NPCs.  I<br/>
actually got great prices just auctioning that I needed bronze, in High Hold<br/>
Keep of all places, after checking all the NPCs of course.  Recently saw<br/>
some there on a shopkeeper and was tempted to buy it and haul it to the<br/>
bazaar and sell it to somebody for twice as much.<br/>
