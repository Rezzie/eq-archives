<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272879165">OK, I made the trip to the Elven land last night to purchase<br/>
Kelin&#39;s Lament (I purchased Cinda&#39;s Carillion too, to save<br/>
another trip).  I hope everybody is aware that unscribed songs<br/>
on your person will disappear upon your death.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I tried using it (lament, that is), and besides &quot;&lt;creature&gt;<br/>
looks sad&quot; or just pissing it off and making it come at me, I<br/>
couldn&#39;t figure out what it does.<br/>
Also I noticed that it only lasts a single beat if it works.  <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me what Lament does, and what it&#39;s useful for?<br/>
