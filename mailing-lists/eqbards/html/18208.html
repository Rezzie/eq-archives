<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818365546">We saw a number of new items drop last night also including an AC16 -2Cha +5 just about everything else<br/>
shadow knight/necro tunic and a AC6 Necro bracer (both purple).  We also saw Mace of Ykesha drop about 4<br/>
times, dam 10, del 22, effect Ykesha.  A friend paladin got an Awesome Axe dam 32, del 40, +6 str +6 agi<br/>
and my wife looted a rather humerous Axe, Dam 45, del 150 Barb/Troll/Ogre only off of a Mountain Giant.<br/>
The one that I&#39;m REALLY trying to get right now is a good friend (another bard) got a pair of AC18 bard<br/>
only boots plus some stats that are the same color as the hero bracer out of Kunar Castle :-)<br/>
