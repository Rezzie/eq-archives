<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002768483">I saw on the Concert Hall that GZ is setting up a meeting on the test<br/>
server for those who want to test out lullaby and pixie strike.  The<br/>
meeting is at the Qeynos newbie area at 3pm Pacific, however he didn&#39;t<br/>
leave a date as far as I saw.  If you&#39;re interested, you might want to<br/>
check out the Gameplay board at Sony to see if the date has been<br/>
posted. <br/>
