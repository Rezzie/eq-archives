<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896524340">I got it to work now :)<br/>
The trick was to unsubscribe and then resubscribe.. Dunno what was messed<br/>
up.<br/>
My email and everything was correct before I unsubscribed too.. Well Im glad<br/>
to be back and hope to learn alot about the big raids now that I have the<br/>
level to do them :)<br/>
Btw what would you all consider the minimum resist gear for a bard of 47th<br/>
level to wear at a nag/vox raid?<br/>
Currently I dont have anything special in the ways of resists...<br/>
