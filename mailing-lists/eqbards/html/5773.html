<div id="ygrps-yiv-862243473">Is it possible that our 22d level Cancel Magic song will cancel out the<br/>
effect of Mort Drowsy? I got hit by that spell once and even with Anthem<br/>
playing my group was still sluggish.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Personally, I like the entrance to Unrest.  I just wait for a<br/>
&gt; train, then when everyone has zoned, just charm the stuff into<br/>
&gt; fighting each other.  Mortuary Fungi are the best because<br/>
&gt; their Mort Drowsy basically renders all melee mobs impotent -<br/>
&gt; even if your charm expires, the Mort Drowsy is still in effect<br/>
&gt; and the melee mobs will get few if any hits in on you before<br/>
&gt; you can recharm the Fungus.  Hags are good too, though a bit<br/>
&gt; difficult to control.<br/>
