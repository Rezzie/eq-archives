    Just curious, what server do you play on and do you play a bard?  The<br/>
reason I ask is because you emails are consistently sniping in nature and<br/>
generally flamebait.  I&#39;ll be the first to defend your right to free speech<br/>
however I would ask that you perhaps temper somewhat your future remarks<br/>
with the fact this is a public forum meant for discussion -- closing doors<br/>
via naked accusations and bombastic proclamations offers little room for<br/>
such to take place on a mutually respectful level.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
