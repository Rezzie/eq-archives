<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656839298"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i can&#39;t remember the exact name, but i think i have this lute called a<br/>
lisera lute (i think). i was just wondering if it was any better/worse than<br/>
my present lute (plain, boring, found in any store).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I tried this recently, but Lisera (from Cassius at the Bard Guild in Qeynos)<br/>
is not equippable.<br/>
<br/>
I completed this quest when I was level 5 and so couldn&#39;t equip the Lute if<br/>
I wanted to.  I was scared out of my wits running all that way to South<br/>
Karana, and then amazed at seeing a bull elephant walk right past me.<br/>
<br/>
Ahh. Happy days. :)<br/>
