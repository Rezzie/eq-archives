<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-499526340">OK, Trakanon is down, undead bard spawns around 18 hours later.  he is killed.<br/>
Does he spawn again before (the real) Trakanon does or do I need to wait?  Anybody know?<br/>
Really frustrating not knowing if the guy is up until you are practically on top of him.  Thanks in advance to anyone who can help.<br/>
