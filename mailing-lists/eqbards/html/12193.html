<div id="ygrps-yiv-727553001">I ran into fellow Bard Umbriel on Fennin Ro and she wanted the recipe for<br/>
the Birthday Cake that I showed her.  I made my first chocolate bar at a<br/>
Baking Skill of 135 and it was trivial.  It&#39;s the toughie because Brownie<br/>
Parts are less common than hen&#39;s teeth.  Cake Rounds you make by getting<br/>
your Pottery Skill up.  The Birthday Cake itself was not trival at 135,<br/>
although I did succeed in my attempts and made 6 cakes for a friend&#39;s<br/>
wedding.  A rumored Wedding Cake recipe has never been confirmed.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun questing around to make those six cakes.  I spent literally hours<br/>
on them, mostly in tracking down Brownie Parts: &quot;/auc Buying Brownie Parts<br/>
(yes, I&#39;m serious)&quot;  Then there are people that think Brownie Parts must be<br/>
needed for some quest and want 100pp for them like a Lambent Stone.  Haha..<br/>
I&#39;m not sure they believe I&#39;m just making cakes.<br/>
