&gt; Does the after effects of songs get longer as you go up in levels?<br/>
&gt; An after effect is when the song icon is displayed but you are now<br/>
&gt; singing a different song.<br/>
<br/>

songs gets stronger, at least until you reach a cap point, but the length of<br/>
the effect seems to remain the same.<br/>
