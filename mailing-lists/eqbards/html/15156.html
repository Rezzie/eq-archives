&gt; Sure unless you have a caster, who typically has a HORRIBLE AC, in which<br/>

If you fish to roleplay or to relax, or just for fun, that&#39;s fine.  But<br/>
there is no economic advantage to fishing.  You could buy more food from 5<br/>
minutes of killing lvl-1 monsters than you would get from fishing for 30<br/>
minutes.<br/>
