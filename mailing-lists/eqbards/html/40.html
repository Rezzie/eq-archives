appreciated. I keep a list of people that I help - those that are<br/>
generous and/or polite will get enthusiastic help in the future. Those<br/>
that do not adequately demonstrate appreciation of the service or are<br/>
otherwise rude will not receive assistance in the future. Those that are<br/>
especially rude.... well.... any time I see them in zone I hang about<br/>
them  for a moment and sing (/say) a few humorous lines describing the<br/>
individual&#39;s failings in my most melodious fashion.<br/>
