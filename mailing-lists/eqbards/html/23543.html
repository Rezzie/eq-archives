&gt; My understanding is that ME really allows 3D games to perform, but has<br/>
&gt; inherent instabilities and other issues that make it a less-than-desirable<br/>
&gt; platform.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had winME for along time now.never had any problems with it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Win2k, on the other hand, apparently has the stability, which<br/>
&gt; comes at the cost of speed, due to security features.  I just wanted some<br/>
&gt; responses from people with practical experience in the matter.  Thanks!<br/>

Win2k is for workstation use only more or less.This microsoft has stated </span></blockquote></div>
