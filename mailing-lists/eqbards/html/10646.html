<div id="ygrps-yiv-234552562">it is approximately a 20% increase.  you&#39;ll notice in the long run, then you<br/>
will get used to it.  try playing elemental rhythms with a normal drum and<br/>
with your mm drum and see the difference in resist increases.  i think you<br/>
got a good deal as well.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well, I purchased a MM drum yesterday, for the low price of 250pp + a<br/>
&gt; LizardScale Cloak, negotiated down to that from 500pp, mainly I think,<br/>
&gt; because a group was selling it and wanted a quick return.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After getting it I was quite disappointed. I didn&#39;t seem to run that<br/>
&gt; much faster, and I couldn&#39;t find a percussion song that had a<br/>
&gt; quantifiable effect increase. Is this due to the recent patch <br/>
&gt; issue that<br/>
&gt; affected MM drum and selo&#39;s? Or can someone reccommend a song <br/>
&gt; I can play<br/>
&gt; to see the difference?<br/>
