<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-739665626">There&#39;s one thing I noticed when twisting songs and would like you<br/>
experienced Bards out there to share your observations. Whenever I stop a<br/>
song in attempt to start second song, there&#39;s a time lag when we can&#39;t yet<br/>
sing the second one (it says &quot;You have not recovered..&quot; just like inbetween<br/>
casting spells). I noticed that under different circumstances, the delay<br/>
(or the &quot;recovery period&quot;) doesn&#39;t seems to be the same.<br/>
I noticed it when I was using my friend&#39;s computer 450MHz in the first full<br/>
screen mode (press F10 once from the default screen) and right after I<br/>
stopped the first song (say CoD) I can NEARLY immediate start second one.<br/>
That day, I was twisting FOUR songs very happily. When I got back home, I<br/>
tried to do it again (with 300MHz computer), i have to particularly wait<br/>
(about one second) for the icon to show up again before i can weave in a<br/>
second song. Twisting three was as much as I could do at that time.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that delay is much less in full screen mode or maybe its<br/>
just checked on the client machine so if u have a fast computer, you can<br/>
start weaving in second song a second earlier?<br/>
