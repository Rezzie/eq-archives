Once again this is Chancez with a question about an item. Since I&#39;m such an<br/>
Item seeker. hehe =) Why is it on my server on Bristlebane I see soo many<br/>
high level bards using the Staff of Writhing. To my understand, the Staff<br/>
of Writhing lowers Charisma which is one of our primary stats and effects<br/>
the effectiveness of the songs. Is it really worth it to use it? It must do<br/>
awesome damage. Anyone please shed light on this for me.<br/>
