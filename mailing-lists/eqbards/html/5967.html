<div id="ygrps-yiv-553566083"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Folks, there are three different things going on here.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
4. Hunting deep in a dungeon. Situation turns bad, EVAC is yelled.<br/>
Druid/wizard casts evacuate. You have plenty of HP when you get the<br/>
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT... message. Then after a normal zone load time,<br/>
you&#39;re dumped back into the room you just left, in the same spot, with a<br/>
LOT of angry mobs. Proceed to die.</div>
