<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741450746">I think you have missed the point, people are disgusted with the fact that<br/>
this list is being used as medium for selling the account.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
care less if he wanted to sell his EQ account, he should refrain from<br/>
posting it to this mailing list.  As a whole this list is an informative<br/>
and intelligent list about bards, not the sale of accounts.  I think we<br/>
are all very well grounded in reality.  I myself have reached lvl 18 and<br/>
think that my grasp on reality is good enough (until I die 6 times in a<br/>
row to a SF in S Ro =). <br/>
