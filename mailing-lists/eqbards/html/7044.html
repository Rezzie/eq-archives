&gt; heard from Brad on that one - it would require<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If I remember the interview that I believe you&#39;re<br/>
referring to they said it would take a lot of work<br/>
but they didn&#39;t make it sound like it was an<br/>
incredible amount. Besides, this is something that<br/>
would be of benefit for EVERY class in EQ except for<br/>
2 or 3. It wouldn&#39;t have any bearing on game balance<br/>
or race/class balance in any way. It would be nothing<br/>
but beneficial.</div>
