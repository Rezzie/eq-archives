<div id="ygrps-yiv-836923072">Yea I really fail to see the excitment over this.  What situation would you<br/>
do this in rather than conventional charm fighting (ie using your pet to<br/>
kill syuff) or chant kiting.<br/>
<br/>
Don;t get me wrong this pause feature is great.  I am working on reudicng my<br/>
bard fatigue tonight.  But charm/chant is just pretty darn slow way to kill<br/>
anything.  I tried this grouped with a shaman and found it pretty bad.  We<br/>
were much better served just doting it while we ran around.</div>
