 </span></blockquote>I know for a fact she doesn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve been playing with her for months, since<br/>
I started EQ.  We&#39;ve played with both of our chars together.  So, I still<br/>
can&#39;t figure out what was going on.  I *did* have SoW cast on me because I&#39;m<br/>
not as fast as SoW without a drum yet.  I wonder if there&#39;s some sort of<br/>
rare bug involved? &lt;shrug&gt;  I&#39;m going to test it out again today, hopefully.</div>
