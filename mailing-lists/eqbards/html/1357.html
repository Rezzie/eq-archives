<div id="ygrps-yiv-475605843">I have found that I dodge much better, usually 3-5 times in a fight with a<br/>
zombie when i am at my equipment only weight of 45.  When carrying loot and<br/>
up around 65 i am lucky to dodge 1 time in a fight with zombie that /cons<br/>
the same.  I think the affect of encumbrance, maybe as a percentage of total<br/>
allowed, on dodge and running speed.<br/>
