For people who are too lazy to print out that analysis (and still want<br/>
to know the &quot;magic&quot; number), a fairly easy and reasonably accurate<br/>
estimate <br/>
<br/>
Magic number = (100/number of people in group) + small amount.<br/>
<br/>
Small amount is 1-5.  <br/>
<br/>
Its easy and pretty accurate :-)<br/>
