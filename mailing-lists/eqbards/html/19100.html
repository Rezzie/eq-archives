&gt; read this from someone in my guild:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; VS<br/>
&gt; A source tells me that VS is a quest mob. He was not supposed to<br/>
&gt; have a drop<br/>
&gt; table. With that in mind as soon as some one finds another way to destroy<br/>
&gt; him there probably won&#39;t be any loot and he will be enhanced once<br/>
&gt; more after<br/>
&gt; its discovered. The mob was not made to be destroyed, Sirran the Lunitic<br/>
&gt; comes to mind.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was in Karnor&#39;s last night when a group killed him. Well they claimed they<br/>
did. Venril was on track, then one of them says he only had 6 gold on him,<br/>
then Venril isn&#39;t on track anymore....<br/>
<br/>
So its possible they determined how to do it again and if so what they said<br/>
adds credence to the quest mob thing.<br/>
