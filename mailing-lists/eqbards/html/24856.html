<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044021203">Oh I know we can take Phin to the cleaners, the trick is he has to be up<br/>
first! I checked KK several times over the weekend, between RL fun and game<br/>
plans, and he was not up. He&#39;s getting taken down pretty quickly apparently<br/>
on our server. Didn&#39;t make it by Karnors, got sidetracked into a Western<br/>
Wastes romp which resulted in some nice green legs for me. Any excuse to<br/>
avoid an idiot dungeon is good for me! (Idiot dungeon: a dungeon any idiot<br/>
can find, typified by many trains, pointless deaths, and general mayhem;<br/>
specifically: Crushbone, Blackburrow, Karnor&#39;s.)<br/>
