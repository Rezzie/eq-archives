to deny access to the game to anyone they want.  I don&#39;t<br/>
recall the Supreme Court decision governing this (way too long<br/>
since I took the course), but basically there was a dispute as<br/>
to whether a private company could be forced via civil liberty<br/>
obligations into a legal contract they didn&#39;t want.  The<br/>
ruling was that it could not, although the government could<br/>
penalize it by witholding federal funding for that reason.<br/>
