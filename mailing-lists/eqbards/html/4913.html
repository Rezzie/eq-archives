<div id="ygrps-yiv-144546959"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; 4.  As far as binding goes, I am indifferent.  From a role-playing stand<br/>
&gt; point it seems logical, but I can see why we do not have it also, so flip a<br/>
&gt; coin.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just my two cents....<br/>
<br/>
if this petition is TRULY to be considered seriously by Verant, I would<br/>
recommend leaving this request off.  As some of the fastest runners in the game,<br/>
what are we truly complaining about after all?  If I were Mr. McQuaid, reading<br/>
the petition, and I came upon this request to bind, I&#39;d start laughing... then<br/>
I&#39;d nerf the class!  no, seriously, I just wouldn&#39;t be as inclined to consider<br/>
the rest of the points, as they have stated their position on binding<br/>
repeatedly... this request would make me lose patience... &lt;shrug&gt;</div>
