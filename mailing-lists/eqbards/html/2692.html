&lt;&lt;Spent more than an hour running around Highpass and Highold looking for some<br/>
Goldensong woman.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s in that courtyard with the merchants right after you zone into Highhold <br/>
Keep.   Nearly impossible to miss... I was on my way back to Freeport from <br/>
Qeynos and dropped by Highpass.  She&#39;s standing to the left of the entrance <br/>
into the Keep.<br/>
