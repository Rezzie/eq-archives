&gt; Thats funny.  My friends and I have been planning to test that very<br/>
&gt; assertion.  We wanted to make a group of Bard, Warrior, Ranger, and 3<br/>
&gt; Paladins (pallies get better heals plus Lay Hands).  We felt with 6 melee<br/>
&gt; types, we could really do some serious damage.  We would have had a great<br/>
&gt; time thru the lower levels, but I could see possible problems at higher<br/>
&gt; levels.  By selectively taunting and backing out of combat, we could have<br/>
&gt; spread the damage around quite well.<br/>

rubicite fever swept the servers. Usually we&#39;d have a group of whoever<br/>
showed up, and it was commonly all melee/hybrid types as the casters<br/>
were all still in Unrest. It can be quite effective and quite fun. You<br/>
get to use songs you wouldn&#39;t normally use.<br/>
