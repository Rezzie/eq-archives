<div id="ygrps-yiv-837378687">Well, don&#39;t feel bad.  I&#39;m level 58, and I didn&#39;t realize that our mez overwrites theirs (and can&#39;t be<br/>
overwritten by theirs) until this weekend.  Luckily, I didn&#39;t get us all killed, but the Enchanter did get<br/>
really snippy.  Shows how often I group with Enchanters.<br/>

&gt; stupid to me that it works that way.  Makes me feel bad cuz i was trying to<br/>

&gt; all died.  *shrug* guess you have to learn the hard way sometimes :) </span></blockquote></div>
