<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096656163">The amount of healing varies with level and also with whether you&#39;re using <br/>
a stringed instrument or not.  At level 23, with my mandolin, a sitting <br/>
person in my party gets back a whopping 11 points per tick.  (Someone said <br/>
that it increases every six levels; if so, one more level and it will go up <br/>
again.  I&#39;ll let you know when I hit 24 and find out.)<br/>
