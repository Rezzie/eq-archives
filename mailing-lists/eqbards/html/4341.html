<div id="ygrps-yiv-360887077"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Dragoon Dirk - get one a.s.a.p.  20pp or so in or near Crushbone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been searching (on Veeshan) for one of these for 3 weeks now in various<br/>
zones and continents. The *only* time someone was selling one and replied to<br/>
me was for 75pp. I&#39;m sorry, but magical or not - I&#39;m not paying 75pp for a<br/>
friggin&#39; dagger - at least not that particular dagger.</div>
