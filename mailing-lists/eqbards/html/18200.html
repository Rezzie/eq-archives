<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574691979">I found this on the Gameplay Forum.  The original post brought up the <br/>
issue of bard songs refreshing then immediately expiring and the lvl <br/>
49 song.<br/>

 I&#39;ve forwarded the issue to the test and development teams. This is <br/>
the first time I&#39;ve heard of it. Sounds like a timing problem. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s looking at this time that there might not be a level 49 song. <br/>
Geoff poured a bunch of good ideas into the 51+ songs. We would <br/>
however be willing to entertain a discussion on this though.<br/>
