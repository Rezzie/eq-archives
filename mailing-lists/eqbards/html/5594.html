<div id="ygrps-yiv-234363668"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So, if you have an effective snarer in your group, please do<br/>
&gt;not use chain, it really pisses us off to see the monster we so <br/>
&gt;diligently snared go running off. If you have an ineffective snarer, <br/>
&gt;chide them about it. It&#39;s one of the most useful spells in the game.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Huh?  Chain is snare + it lessens the attackspeed of the mob.<br/>
I don&#39;t get it.  What do you think chain does?<br/>
<br/>
I will always override every snare/root I see with chains, much<br/>
more effective for the party.  Slower attacks and the effect of<br/>
snare.<br/>
<br/>
If I chain something, it AINT moving.<br/>
