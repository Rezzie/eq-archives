&gt;The bard at Verant probably plays mana song all the time, even<br/>
&gt;in combat :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sorry about the complaint in the previous message, but it is<br/>
&gt;getting annoying to me how many people from every class in this game<br/>
&gt;think that verant hates them their class more than the rest of the<br/>
&gt;classes.  As the one post said, by what I read about<br/>
&gt;EQ, Verant hates every class more than all the rest of the<br/>
&gt;classes.<br/>
