<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449003330">I went into Mistmoore for the first time last night.  While standing near<br/>
the zone border, I got messages similar to those you get in Unrest when<br/>
standing near the left wall.  For example in Unrest, you get the message &quot;a<br/>
festering hag casts a spell&quot; even though the hag is nowhere in sight but<br/>
instead underneath you in the basement.  I assume that means that the z-axis<br/>
bug also exists in Mistmoore and that I should be very careful when singing<br/>
are of effect songs like Denons Disruptive Discord.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell me which songs I should avoid like the plague while in<br/>
Mistmoore?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
