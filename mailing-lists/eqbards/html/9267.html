<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-871691862">While camping on the first level of the basement one time I kept getting<br/>
messages that Princess Lenya was casting spells.  That brought back bad<br/>
memories of hags attacking me along the wall in Unrest due to the z-axis<br/>
bug.  I quickly deleted DDD from my song list and picked another one to<br/>
sing.  It might be safe to sing AE songs further down in the rooms you<br/>
mentioned but I would be very cautious on the first level of the basement.<br/>

&gt; area if someone lets them run, so AE songs are not totally safe (but I use<br/>
&gt; them anyway). </span></blockquote></div>
