<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410965776"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; This is a central distinction in the kiting issue.  Snare (and<br/>
&gt; root) has to be cast on the mob, and thus can be resisted.  <br/>
&gt; SoW and Accelerando are cast on the kiter, and thus cannot be<br/>
&gt; resisted.<br/>

and then running around using a bow.</div>
