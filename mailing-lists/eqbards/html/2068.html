<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279548556">Sorry if this is off topic, but I don&#39;t know a more knowledgeable group of<br/>
people so I though I&#39;d ask here.<br/>
I&#39;m a level 20 bard and am planning a trip to Cazic-Thule this weekend.  Can<br/>
anyone offer me any advice on what I should do or not do?  Things to avoid?<br/>
What should I expect?<br/>
Also, where is the closest place to get bound?  I&#39;d hate to have to make a<br/>
run from Freeport if I died.<br/>
