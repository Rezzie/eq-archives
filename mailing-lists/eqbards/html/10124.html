 </span></blockquote>You keep referring back to this unfair test you did.  I believe you admitted<br/>
that the Shaman was equipped with a LJ Vest and other items not readily<br/>
accessible to a level 17.  You were also equipped with substandard items,<br/>
Studded Leather for the most part.  A Bard of the 17th level should be<br/>
wearing Full Banded with a few Bronze pieces at minimum.<br/>
<br/>
I have no doubt that if you did the test again with comparably equipped PCs,<br/>
the Bard would win just about every time.<br/>
