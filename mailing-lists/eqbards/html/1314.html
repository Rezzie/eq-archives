<div id="ygrps-yiv-1799042180">The level 28 pixie song is exactly that, a targeted lullaby.  It is a very <br/>
useful song!<br/>

&gt;Maybe we could suggest Verant replace one of the &quot;useless&quot;<br/>
&gt;songs (e.g. Charisma or Identify) with a targeted lullaby<br/>
&gt;which only works on a single mob?  I died yesterday because<br/>
&gt;I ran across a newbie (level 5) being beat up by two bandits.<br/>
&gt;I started my lullaby to make it a fair one-on-one fight, and<br/>
&gt;shortly afterwards a wandering guard killed me.<br/>
