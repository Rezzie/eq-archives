<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046350660">I stopped going when I hit 53 :) Or more specifically I began to hate the<br/>
Vox/Naggy raids so much that I stayed up all night and dinged 53 so I<br/>
couldnt go anymore.  Veeshan had a very good leader who led the raids weekly<br/>
for months, when he gave it up (got too high), no one stepped up and the<br/>
band of dragon slayers disbanded.  Now its often a collection of idiots and<br/>
munchkins who gather for the dragon slaying.  Loot is frequently ninjaed and<br/>
the raid often takes up to 5 hours!  I decided I&#39;d either buy a scale or<br/>
wait till my guild can kill Gone...<br/>
