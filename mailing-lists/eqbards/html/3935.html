&gt;Well, remember the place.  Did you find the area with another structure<br/>
&gt;guards by two ice bones?  If you enter it, you will be teleported back out.<br/>
&gt;Seems likely to me this is a portal to the (unfinished) dimension of water,<br/>
&gt;good thing you will already have Ayre memorized.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve checked out that cave as well...There is a strange symbol on the <br/>
&gt;wall<br/>
&gt; &gt;that repeats itself in many rooms...I found an alter, with 2 ice bone<br/>
