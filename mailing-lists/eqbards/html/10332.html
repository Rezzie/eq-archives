<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945823177">I&#39;ve been playing FF8, and have played all the American versions<br/>
  of Final Fantasy since they&#39;ve come out.<br/>
<br/>
  Squaresoft builds upon very simple spell principles, perhaps too<br/>
  simple, but they make sense and they work well.<br/>
<br/>
  I would like to see a high level song called:<br/>
<br/>
  Solon&#39;s Song of Silence<br/>
  Effect: NON-PARTY: Silence.<br/>
<br/>
  PBAE, fixed radius, 2 tick negate casting.<br/>
  NPC has one chance to resist intial and to break free each tick<br/>
  thereafter.  Lute for enhanced effects.  Save versus Magic.<br/>
<br/>
  Harmonic.</div>
