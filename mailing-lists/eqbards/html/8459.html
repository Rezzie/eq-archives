<div id="ygrps-yiv-890708928">Deleted the email this thread was on but I would like to point something out. I highly doubt the<br/>
Lute has a magical effect. It was used in a quest before and unless it changes will be again as of<br/>
Tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
I know verant does some dumb things.. but who would really trade the Lute (which is hard to get) if<br/>
it had such high magic properties for some above average armor?<br/>
