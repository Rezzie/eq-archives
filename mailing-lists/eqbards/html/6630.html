<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145119991">I had heard a rumor that you can fish for an extended period of time & get a<br/>
Koalindl fish.  Just wanted to let everyone know I tested this.  After catching<br/>
about 80 fish & assorted daggers & old shoe, I DID NOT catch a Koalindl fish.<br/>
<br/>
Also I was not killed by the Paladin (thought he was not fond of me), but by a<br/>
militia Corporal, after I did kill the fish.</div>
