<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468743874">Don&#39;t know if anyone else notice but the vision problem with the masks was<br/>
fixed in the last patch.<br/>
<br/>
The bug was when you had the masks effects up and played a song that also<br/>
included a vision enhancement you would return to human level vision when<br/>
the mask effect wore off.<br/>
<br/>
Example being.<br/>
1) start up mask of deception.  get ultra-vision<br/>
2) start playing psalm of warmth... get infra-vision but ultra is better so<br/>
no change in sight<br/>
3) stop playing the song and wait for the mask ultra-vision to wear off<br/>
<br/>
And pouf!  You had human vision by default till you zoned.  I am so glad<br/>
they fixed this.<br/>
