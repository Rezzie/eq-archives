<div id="ygrps-yiv-311952489">I have acquired nicknames such as Captain America (because I&#39;m wearing<br/>
Steel, Rubicite, and Lambent), and Major Glory.  This is also being referred<br/>
to as the &quot;smurf transformation&quot;.  Spent a while in Sol A last night, got<br/>
the vambraces  but the mages just wouldn&#39;t load the boots, guess ill have to<br/>
go back, might try for BP tonight.<br/>
