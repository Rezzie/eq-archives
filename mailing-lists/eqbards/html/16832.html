&gt; only once since i got this song has it actually helped.  we still all died,<br/>
&gt; but it allowed us to get the yak from the lord before we were all gone.<br/>

No one commented on my idea for a new song though. Selo&#39;s Song of the<br/>

pets. See <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bogon.com/~jhenders/eqshots/cazicdt1.jpg">http://www.bogon.com/~jhenders/eqshots/cazicdt1.jpg</a>  and<br/>
