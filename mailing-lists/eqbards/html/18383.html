&gt; I&#39;m not sure if I found a cleric trainer either, but I definitely<br/>
&gt; found one<br/>
&gt; for all the &#39;good&#39; INT casters, ranger, rogue, shaman, and paladin.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if this is true of all the trainers but at least the rogue<br/>
trainer doesn&#39;t offer training in all skills. Our rogue was bound there so<br/>
we dueled him off so he could train up picklock to 200 real quick one night.<br/>
He ended up having to die a real death so he&#39;d have time to gate to misty<br/>
thicket and go to the rogues guild in Rivervale because the rogue trainer in<br/>
FV doesn&#39;t offer picklock training...<br/>
