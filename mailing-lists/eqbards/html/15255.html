I find it amusing that they don&#39;t seem to have an email<br/>
address for bugs.  The only official way I know of to report<br/>
bugs is the in-game /bug command, which doesn&#39;t let you cut<br/>
and paste extensive text like my test.  Kinda reminds me of<br/>
the companies who forward all their customer service calls to<br/>
voicemail without having any way to reach a human being...<br/>
