The scintillating colors refers to the color shift line of spells, an AoE (maybe point blank but not sure) stun effect. <br/>
Enchanters really shine in the mob control department, but on single pulls can do very well : tashan mob, then slow it or stun it repeatedly. <br/>
    <br/>
    What message gets displayed when an enchanter successfully casts tashan?<br/>
    I&#39;ve grouped with this enchanter on numerous occasions and I know that in<br/>
    normal pulls (1 or 2) mobs, he primarily keeps stunning them over and over<br/>
    again.  The message on screen that popped up numerous times during the fight<br/>
    was the &quot;scintillating colors&quot; message.  I&#39;ve always assumed this was the<br/>
    message enchanters get when they successfully stun.  <br/>
