<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110901615">The other day while coming across a particular warrior on a venture, I noticed how he would start fighting something that he couldn&#39;t handle and constantly rely on others to finish off his beasty or zone (zoned more often than not.)  I thought a song might bring the young warrior some courage, but he didn&#39;t seem to appreciate my tune?  Has any other bard had this problem?  The lyrics are below--perhaps a fellow bard can advise me on possible alterations?<br/>
<br/>
Brave Sir Robin,<br/>
Bravely ran away!<br/>
When danger reared its ugly head<br/>
He bravely tucked his tail and fled!<br/>
Bravely bravely bravely<br/>
 Brave Sir Robin<br/>
Bravely ran away<br/>
Brave Sir Robin<br/>
Never becomes afraid<br/>
To have his liver cut out<br/>
and his head bashed in<br/>
and his heart ripped out<br/>
and his eyes pushed in<br/>
and his arms torn off<br/>
and his bowels removed<br/>
and his toes cut off<br/>
and his ribs crushed in<br/>
Bravely bravely bravely<br/>
Brrrave Sir Robin<br/>
<br/>
Why didn&#39;t he enjoy my melody?<br/>
