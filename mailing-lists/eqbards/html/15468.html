&gt;My guild is planning to try the Anzarak (sp?) Island on Saturday.  Heh, 9<br/>
&gt;red to 50 mobs go agro... we&#39;ll see how it turns out.  My one other trip<br/>
&gt;there involved killing the fairies on the first island.  There&#39;s a lot of<br/>
&gt;crazy loots and some of them are mentioned in the bard quests.  Has anyone<br/>
&gt;done any of the quests?  I presume that you kill stuff, loot for your quest<br/>
&gt;items and then somehow make your way back to the first island and then the<br/>
&gt;quest temple to turn in the items.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone ever do any PoA quests?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>go to eqcasters, i submit all the stuff our guild has done, so far some<br/>
necromancer, druid, enchanter, cleric quests are all that we have<br/>
completed. I think we can do one bard quest, but we have to keep doing the<br/>
azarack isle and killing the boss there. Oh well, maybe tomorrow ;)<br/>
