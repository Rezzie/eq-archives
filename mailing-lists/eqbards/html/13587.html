<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158225685">When you calculate ratios for weapons do you use the base damage or<br/>
damx2+1.<br/>
<br/>
In other words your 6/23 sword:<br/>
DO you use .261 (6/23)<br/>
or .565 (13/23)?<br/>
<br/>
It does make a difference.  I am asking because my lvl 16 bard seems to<br/>
be outgrowing his weapons (fine steel spear, dwarven mace and tentacle<br/>
whip, had them all since about lvl 5)<br/>
