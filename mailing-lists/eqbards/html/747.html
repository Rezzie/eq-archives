<b>Subject:</b> Something I noticed about damage at level 20 <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049773408">I noticed something once I hit level 20.  I use two weapons, stats as<br/>
follows:<br/>
<br/>
Pugius:  5/21 piercing - main hand<br/>
Dwarven Axe:  6/26 slashing - off hand<br/>
<br/>
Now before level 20, the damage from these guys was pretty standard,<br/>
usually 10-11 for Pugius and 12-13 for the axe.<br/>
<br/>
Once I hit level 20, the damage from the dagger seemed to stay the same<br/>
(I haven&#39;t seen anything higher than 11), but the axe now does up to 18<br/>
damage.<br/>
<br/>
I know at level 20 you start doing more than 2*damage+1, but I was<br/>
wondering why it only seems to be affecting my axe&#39;s damage.  <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
