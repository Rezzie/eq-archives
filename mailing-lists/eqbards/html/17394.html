<div id="ygrps-yiv-928284412">i wish.  i hit 49, got less than a bubb, and have been there ever since.  i<br/>
am too worried about maxing shada before expansion.  she was at barely a<br/>
sliver of 50 left, i got as close to 49 as possible without un-dinging.  i<br/>
got her back up to almost 3 bubbs.  once she is maxed i will start working<br/>
on tyria again =)  of course being 50 is more important for a bard, being 49<br/>
is enough for a wiz for now.<br/>
