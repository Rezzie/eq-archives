<div id="ygrps-yiv-680876800">Bards can train 1 point in 2H Blunt and 2H slash. <br/>
and we can in fact equip any 2h weapon that says BRD and has our race<br/>
listed. This was supposedly done so GMs could equip certain equipment.<br/>
<br/>
The easy way to play with it is to get a glowing wooden crook, kind of<br/>
amusing. Who knows in a few months, maybe all the warriors/paladins/etc<br/>
will have them and a bard can loot it for laughs. Equipped it looks like<br/>
an executioner&#39;s axe. ;)<br/>
