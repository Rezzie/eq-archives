&gt; True, but at the level you are fighting wisps for example a cap of 100 on a<br/>
&gt; level based skill is moot; you can&#39;t get there anyway.  They just didnt want<br/>
&gt; any melee type running around killing wisps with something they got off a<br/>
&gt; level 7 froglock, like woven gloves.<br/>

fists seem to be a 2 damage 30 delay weapon.  The maximum I<br/>
ever hit for before level 20 is 5 points.  The maximum I&#39;ve<br/>
ever hit for so far at level 35 is 8.<br/>
