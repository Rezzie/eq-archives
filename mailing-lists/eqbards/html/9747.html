<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022356179">When I was in Cazic Thule the other day I was waiting on my group to get there. I went over near the<br/>
Gorilla spawn because that&#39;s where I was going to hunt with my group.<br/>
<br/>
There was another group there and I role-played asking them if I could loot a mudwater Rune from a<br/>
Fanatic if that got one as I needed it to complete a quest.<br/>
<br/>
They rudely said no only if you pay us 100PP for loot rights. I politely left the area and said<br/>
thank you but that was to high.<br/>
<br/>
I know the argument of &quot;there killing it, it&#39;s there loot.&quot; but if you don&#39;t need it don&#39;t loot it.<br/>
Or charge a reasonable price to loot it.<br/>
<br/>
Was it going to kill them to help someone out?<br/>
