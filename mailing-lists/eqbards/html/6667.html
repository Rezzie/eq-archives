&gt; &gt; Ok, we now know that our song will not cancel SoW anymore, but does the<br/>
&gt; same<br/>
&gt; &gt; hold true for J Boots? I haven&#39;t been able to check it yet.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was grouped with my friend last night; he had J Boots active; I had<br/>
&gt; Selo&#39;s on and<br/>
&gt; I kept overtaking him. *sigh*<br/>

the recent patch in that your friend should have benefitted from  Selos<br/>
while you were singing it (since you were grouped) and therefore kept up<br/>
with you (assuming it wasn&#39;t a lag issue).  If he didn&#39;t, that should<br/>
probably be bugged.  <br/>
