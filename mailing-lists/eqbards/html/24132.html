<div id="ygrps-yiv-536256926"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I don&#39;t think he WAS arguing that bards are &quot;Overpowered&quot; in the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>sense of what SLYDE thinks the word &quot;Overpowered&quot; means.  I am very <br/>
eager to see what WHEE really does believe...<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly the thing I was trying to point out to Kitasi about <br/>
the &quot;Overpowered&quot; and &quot;Difficult to play&quot; distinction.<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t get some common definition, we end up with 40 posts <br/>
arguing semantics. I just had a flash of deja-vu.  :)<br/>
