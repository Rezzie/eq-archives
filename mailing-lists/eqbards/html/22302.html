<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067687481">I went there many times, never had an AOE problem.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of things:<br/>
Invisiblity works on everything I have seen in there.  This is a good thing<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
The Chief stands on a ledge, interestingly, there is very little agro<br/>
between the area below the ledge and the ledge itself.  We were fighting<br/>
right under the Chief (almost) and he did not agro on us.  I did NOT use AOE<br/>
in that spot though.</div>
