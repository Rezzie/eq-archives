<div id="ygrps-yiv-701169886">I keep hearing about 30 being a &quot;hell level&quot; for folks.  Bah!  My hell level<br/>
is 28.  Why?  I can&#39;t find anything to solo unless it&#39;s in a train-filled<br/>
dungeon :o/  I would do giant skels in Rathe mtns, but they are never there.<br/>
I kill lizards, but only HGs and one-eyes pop up (although I will remeber<br/>
that fact when I&#39;m in my lower 30&#39;s)  I&#39;ve thought about gargoyles in OOT,<br/>
but have never been there, nor have I any experiance vs. gargoyels (in this<br/>
game).  Anyone with any ideas on a nice quiet place a level 28 bard can solo<br/>
his way to his lev song?<br/>
