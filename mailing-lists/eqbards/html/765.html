<div id="ygrps-yiv-400271972">I know a lot of people prefer the digest - and it&#39;s handy to hit reply - but I personally find it annoying to see a subject line titled &quot;Digest Number 40&quot;..  I would ask people to type some sort of subject - so you don&#39;t have to read several sentences to know what the subject is about...<br/>

Thanks<br/>
