<div id="ygrps-yiv-766567352">imho at level 11 it doesn&#39;t matter much.  If you need more STR then go with<br/>
that, else use the CHA.  At 11 I was always looking for STR as I was<br/>
wearing all bronze and heavy weapons.  I didn&#39;t start trading in my STR for<br/>
CHA until I was getting lighter gear.<br/>
