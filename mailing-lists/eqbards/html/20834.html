<div id="ygrps-yiv-2048581716">Last night we (my bard and his guild) were on a guild raid of Kaesora.<br/>
Things were going great,  when my ISP decided it was time to crash.<br/>
<br/>
So now I am camped in the middle of a dangerous room with no chance of<br/>
running out.  My guild is unlikely to be able to muster up enough force to<br/>
get there anytime soon (we are small, we needed outside help getting this<br/>
far).  So what can i do?  Any ideas?</div>
