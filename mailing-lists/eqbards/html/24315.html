<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202631251">I am trying to compare some weapon upgrades but can&#39;t seem to figure <br/>
out how to calculate Damage Per Second.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know the basic formula (I know it is dependent on Attack, <br/>
Offense, etc... ) Just want to get a basic feel to compare weapons <br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
