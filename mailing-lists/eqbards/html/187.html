<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629727049"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I use a tentical whip every once in a while. When it does the lifetap the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>song I am playing seems to lock. When this happens all the spell &gt;buttons <br/>
turn back to normal and I cant start a song new because the other one is <br/>
still going, nor can I stop it without haveing to log or zone.<br/>
<br/>
Yes!  Exactly the same thing happens with my magic axe that casts Berserker <br/>
Strength.  Sounds like it may be a bug on all auto-spell-casting weapons. <br/>
 Please, everyone who encounters this file another /bug report.  It&#39;s <br/>
crippling to the Bard class.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, being stunned by a monster also unlocks it.  Sometimes being <br/>
bashed without stun seems to as well, but I&#39;m not sure about that.  The <br/>
/stopsong command does NOT fix it.<br/>
