&gt; I agree with Thormeal here - I have a level 33 ranger that has been grouped<br/>

&gt; I kill something green to me, he will not get exp if we are grouped.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The confusion comes because if HE kills something, and I assist in no way in<br/>
&gt; the fight (I assume bard songs would be considered assisting, but I did this<br/>
&gt; with my ranger so can&#39;t say for sure) he will get the exp he normally would,<br/>

most damage in group (would get the kill if not grouped) seems<br/>
to be a factor in whether or not someone too low level gets<br/>
experience.<br/>
