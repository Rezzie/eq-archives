<br/>
Thanks for the quick replies as always.  Here is another query for you seasoned vets of Norrath.<br/>
<br/>
How do you get to Rivervale from Freeport?  From watching everyone&#39;s posts that seems to be the best way to get xp, and loot early.  I&#39;d also like to pick up that quest and get a squad ring (I could really use it at times).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone,<br/>
Well met and happy hunting!<br/>
