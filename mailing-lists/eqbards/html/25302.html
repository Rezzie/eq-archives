<b>Subject:</b> How to Properly rip off a bard <br/>
<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-329062768">G&#39;day all i managed to pick up &quot;an ancient coin&quot; from the captain of the<br/>
guard in city of mist.<br/>
My question is this: i know this is for the tambourine quest, but is this<br/>
coin worth anything to a bard.<br/>
<br/>
No i dont want to take advantage of anyone, but i need to be able to afford<br/>
next level spells as well :)<br/>
So if this coin is worth 100pp or so, the first bard i see can have it for<br/>
free... but if it is worth anything else, then how much?<br/>
