&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I must say that this sounds like a great toy but can someone pleze let<br/>
&gt; me know whata wakishi is or the hilt. I have just starteda bard and i luv<br/>
&gt; it:). Done the wizzys, necros, warr, and shaman and by far I think I have<br/>
&gt; had the most fun with the Bard. I am only in my 11th circle of teaching so<br/>
&gt; pleze be gentle on me. I just have never heard of it. Ohh and by the way<br/>
&gt; spoilers dont bother me a bit. If ya dont want to use spoilers that is your<br/>
&gt; option. I just wanta have a good time:)<br/>
