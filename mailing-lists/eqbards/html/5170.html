<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009875004">Hey everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a question for the higher level bards on the list.  Just how much<br/>
should a battle drum cost?  Based on the stats I&#39;ve seen I think I&#39;d be<br/>
willing to pay 500pp, but at the same time there&#39;s no need to get ripped<br/>
off. :)  What say ye, great bards?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
