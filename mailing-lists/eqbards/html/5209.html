 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t include my Carrilon details, because I assumed that certain songs<br/>
are just a pain in general.  But I do have at least a 50% failure rate on<br/>
it, even at 15th.   Anyone else notice the Charisma song being tough to<br/>
start?  The Lullaby (which I just got) starts normally, even if it is<br/>
resisted 50% of the time *chuckles*<br/>
