<br/><br/>
<div id="ygrps-yiv-898746848">Has anyone else noticed that when you use Brusco&#39;s Bellow, all the song<br/>
icons stay grayed out like the song is in progress until you click one of<br/>
them to turn it off? I get my damage  (or resist message) but then the song<br/>
just never seems to complete its cycle, and I have tried waiting quite<br/>
awhile.<br/>
